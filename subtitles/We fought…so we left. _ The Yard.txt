did he try to did he try to use your balls to order food did he did he did he okay that doesn't even make sense none of it makes sense we have to pause so we talked about it on the main episode that these guys are writing they have become like me when I don't stream they're insufferable they're bouncing off each other [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] everything dude someone stole packages and you didn't even care it's not about I care about it you guys are sitting on the sideline going he he left the door open he's a pedophile yeah he probably [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kids he took my voice too you got [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nonstop nowadays you get so nasty with your bit this is what you guys are doing don't don't do this we have to stick together and you know what you see how he flinches when you point that's a reaction that's you know what else to right before we came in here Yingling demurely calmly and I would say reasonably ask for $50,000 raise lwood said nope walked in the office walked in the set sorry the disting you think the calist is what determines the raise not the performance I think he made a good point what was the point he said I want a $50,000 raise I think he just and then Aiden said do you not know what airplanes are and that's why you drive to Yuma and then he threw his A's bar across the room that's what happened nickling earlier said uh we got our packages stolen I said did you look at the cameras he says we have cameras that was crazy and then he's like I want a raise it was lowkey crazy he didn't know about the cameras I'll give you that he did Nick did it was lowkey crazy zipper taught Yingling how to look at the cameras Nick don't work here and he Nick Yingling did go to Nick and went hey how do you do the camera thing I'll you st forgot about the cameras they were forgot Sor I remember the moment they were installed we had a scare we had a fright there was a fright there was a fright there was a scare was it the the woman in her Beast there was a Red Scare a woman with her Beast out oh God her Beast is out what about her Harlot what was that her she's the woman that always ask asks for the hose yes the H oh that the H lady there is a lady who bathes with her Beast where where stri and ANS here we do we do have a lot of people we have a lot of visitors yeah we got some visitors friends I'll say we've been here for a long time we've never had any issues with stuff being stolen bar one vehicle bar the K truck and my voice which you know is it really stealing if it's unlocked with the keys in it yes some would say it belongs to the Earth some would say it belongs to famously that is still Grand Theft Auto in the same way it's still breaking entering if your door's unlocked it's not the same if your door is unlocked it is breaking and entering if I open and enter if I if I take branches off the tree no it's breaking an entry it is still it's a still b&amp; the break what broke it's not broken legally it's a be but it shouldn't be called that you want the judge to just clarify like hey this it was an entering open it was just charge me with entering okay throw the book at me but make sure it's right we could call it entering but be the same punishment as a being oh three to three to five for entering so you ADM it's different we live in I'm telling you it's the same you guys are just worried about the point being we've been here a long time we've really only had the car incident and for all the time that's passed Grand Theft Auto we've never had packages stolen true up until the past two months I don't think it's Grand Theft Auto because of the teally not true also there was there was package stolen before which ones we had a package stolen from the front yeah we no the front doesn't count why is the packages for the why he saying the front nobody knows it's Mad Max in the front I'll give you that but it's still got they could be shooting kids in the front parking lot and I wouldn't know about it breaking is no longer necess for you to be convicted of burglary so call it burglary pissing me off can we can we talk about it can we talk about how we've had six boxes of takis outside the warehouse no don't finish it that's it it's just weird the TW it's just weird that we just had boxes outside saying there they've been sitting there cuz like a lot of other packages have coming G don't draw conclusions don't worry there's no glitter bomb inside of it in the Takis St just take it and enjoy your Takis is it illegal it probably is if you had a package and if you opened it it shot you in the skull with a gun with a gun it's illegal for you to be opening it yeah like yeah stole the package is it illegal to leave it outside for someone to open I think the answer is yes no no on better what if you order a box online that kills you and someone this is this is like this is like a l Tunes crime this is like if I put a piano over a door and somebody opens it is it is it a crime because they were trying to move it to the second story is that Canadian woman who kills people in Canada through medicine it's the euthanasia woman oh yeah and but she she does it by mail and it's a box that explodes in your face and kills you and if some pack some porch pirate wants to come take it you you're telling me Canadian voluntary youth in Asia works by by mail by Ma Mr Beast should do cpto like a like a you can order like a Russian Roulette I assisted 100 voluntary euth in Asia patients he's like Loki it sucks that the healthcare is like this in the countrys that nobody the government isn't providing Canadians have to wait you order your you order your Beast box and it comes and the gun shoots immediately you open it and but it's a Russian Roulette you might not die and if you don't die you get like $1,000 you have to mail to one new person o well you don't win you got to win like money you get like a thous you get like a feasable yay yeah or you get shot in the head they're yummy they're

around anyone in person was at YouTube live 200 like8 or whatever and there's like an interview with Bo Burnham where he's just like this guy's a genius I don't care if it's a character or not that's the smartest guy on YouTube he's so good in 21 jum I didn't know that was him watching old YouTube is so strange cuz the cast of characters like Katy Perry's awesome tits it's like you don't remember do you think they're not only I on the piano genuinely the only thing I know is Bo Burnham doing art is dead and I think uh they let what what the buck host it you remember what the buck hated what hat what the buck you hated something I didn't like yeah you're brave enough to say that right now right here as a young and yeah I didn't like his um careful you find an image from me zip careful what kind of person is he well he's Katy Perry YouTube live He's a what what type of person is he why didn't you like him actually cuz I know why I didn't like him I just didn't enjoy the content I also didn't enjoy the content what is what the buck dude yeah the the fourth the fourth one there she is on a piano while Bo buron plays piano damn and then she would 10 years later drop the worst [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] of all time known to man her recent album people like it no I think we got to chill on Katy Perry why everyone everyone's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on her I agree I think she's the goat also did nothing wrong last Friday night's of time was song I Kissed the first lesbian in music people hate her because the first White Les all her hits are with what's his name no is that her what's with what's his name literally no information who the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you talking about who's the shitty guy in holwood who had all Taylor Swiss records Epstein Jeffrey jeffre EP Jeffrey Epstein she fireworks was about him yeah and she thought he was amazing and she thought he was so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fireworks from that Island scooter braa that's it oh that that was the the representative or the the the guy who like represented a bunch of artists right the representative that represented a bunch of them it was a dumb way to say it but isn't that who he was yeah well he was the whole thing with like he tried to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] over Taylor Swift and he owned all our masters and then she re-released all her songs yeah but now I'm realizing as we talk about this I'm actually not thinking of the right person I'm thinking of who's the person who wrote Lady Gaga's early music looking at your beautiful kid and being like scooter that's what I was going to say no one named scooter should have authority over anything I'm going to name I'm going to name you skateboard like that's crazy I went to high school with a guy Nam scooter scooter must have been invented like recent no idea he's amazing at basketball surely scooter scooter he W dude he was 65 and he was the best athlete at school I think Kesha Kesha oh she was in some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right Kesha oh Kesha was like I think she had a big she was like sexually abused by her yeah by one man MD name is I'm trying to I I don't know if that's Scooter Braun I'm we're so bad at [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] popular culture gossip this is old [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm just starting to see a pattern here like what bro I was in the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] wrestling why is's middle name in quotations and she's held down by her manager wasn't that Kesha ored by I want to see what who's this Kesha oh the mother of Kesha you don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] read [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you didn't know the answer until you reread just saying I just knew that it wasn't

though I always hated that I sign cool no cuz I was like it doesn't make sense the S is for S sounds and the dollar sign is for money I didn't like it you didn't like when she was key money ha I didn't like it money pissed me off I performed there was a a day did I ever talked about this there's a day a long time ago I was one of the representatives at school like you would class officers president vice president I was like one of those guys and if there was a school spirit day you had to dress up if you were one of the officers I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hated school spirit day I thought it was so lame it's like the most awesome day at school ever everyone's dressed up and having fun people you wear like the school colors or lines and I just didn't I just I didn't like it did you guys have red ribbon day no no it was the California thing maybe it like an aound it was for like drugs like don't not doing drugs you wear as much red as you can to school really was crazy my friend definitely pranked you crazy we red while you tell your story we all have to wear red uh but the punishment was you had to get up in front of the entire school at lunch and sing a song and I sang We Are Who We Are by Kesha in front of everyone instead of dressing up crazy you're actually delusional you get bullied or they think you were hype do you like the of money I didn't get made fun of at all you did guy who got made fun of you like I got made fun of for other things what' you get made fun what's the most someone's ever made fun of you in school uh the most bullied I ever was in school was when I was playing basketball in 8th grade and there was like a group of that I had a really really shitty coach he was really uh really mean and as it turns out years later famously cheated on his wife go scar famously uh his name is well known I can probably I wonder if I could just name him why well it would be famously because he was a bad basketball that's not why no he was well known in our town cuz he had a business and he was married to this woman who's a part of a family that owns this big restaurant chain in the county and he cheated on her a bunch and they were like a wealthy family in the area and then they divorced but in the divorce he managed to get the restaurant away from her family and keep it so it was like kind of a hostile takeover of sorts dop he also tried to hit on my mom in front of my dad years later after this whole can't blame who you see a beautiful spell is cast on what are you supposed to do so once in a lifetime do and apparently like he's a and and and my brother like worked for this restaurant like years later apparently he's like a shitty owner shitty boss and he was a terrible work for this guy after all that this these things didn't these interlocked these hadn't happened like before he got rised like no other um I get your son a job he was probably my worst he of all the like adult figures in my life growing up he was 100% the worst in terms of like he he did nothing to like Build Me Up he only made me feel bad it was an awful season and his son was in the grade below us and quite good at basketball he was in club basketball and had a group of friends that all played Club basketball and those seventh graders made fun of me at basketball all the time and between that and the coach being shitty to me the coach wasn't the coach wasn't like a have your back type of guy he kind of just let people eat eat is dog dog world boy and uh dude that was like the lowest my confidence ever was it was like the main reason I like quit taking basketball like super seriously after that because of like how shitty they made me feel all the time so that was like probably the most bullied I've ever been theth grade basketball SE like was he hot yeah was he like a good-looking guy um I think he's like attractive in like yeah in like the traditional sense clear he's good with the H he he might be all Charisma too what do you mean like like if he's not beautiful looking he could just be all like Max he's kind of the he's got the hot old hot older guy that like a lot of girl like a lot of girls would say like that guy looks like a douchebag I would say he's got like that type of hot Gavin Newsome looking like a little bit Yeah but not as hot as Gavin new the problem is Gavin new is so hot it comes around the other way did he hit on did he hit on your mom after or before your brother took a job from before or sorry sorry sorry after after he worked for him for like a couple years and then uh I think they were like eating or something like that was it like was it just real slick like you look were there for no I was not there this is a story that your mom and like looks over at your dad he's like

pomegranates are the pomeg man I'm in my backyard and um and we're playing like hide-and seek with like flashlights at night time we're running around and uh I see a pomegranate on the ground with the flashlight in the inside of pomegranate with the seeds I thought it was someone's mouth like like detached from their body like someone had taken a mouth removed it from the whole head and then embedded it in the ground and it was like it teeth and blood and I got so scared and I was just afraid of the backyard yeah that's kid kit for like a long time were you afraid of pomegranates did you

Lunchable on they were like regular they were circular but they weren't small they were like bigger like oh but they were circular that means they're not that means they're processed oh and then I asked did you really oh they're processed I guess they're not delicious yeah I think that would reduce the quality of the product chocolate cake processed delicious worse than cuties homemade no chocolate is not not from movie theater goes no chocolate is homemade there's blood on all of our hands bro he was saying that they were so good he's saying the best na he's had in his life were there any toppings or was it just the cheese it was just the cheese yeah of course cuz it's at Regal [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] theaters and they cost how much $15 was it like was it like liquid cheese yeah it's the shitty gold liquid cheese that they get out of the machine cheese Mach can't be the cheese looked I know the cheese I won't I I won't I won't even hold you the cheese looked disgusting it was like cuz it is disgusting it it was like the it was like it had bubbles in it but there was no air it was just the shape of bubbles it was it just hot and you were hungry that's what I I was like okay you're

isn't interesting to you Jee dude that one's yellow that looks go to the top left this is like footy so that's not what it that's the closest to what it looks like like it had the cheese in the compartment and then it had the chips in the compartment but it didn't look like those it looks good and you just at least yeah look like was delicious dude you would get better nachos sorry my girlfriend I was going to bring this up too his dumbass [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ass girlfriend dude everyone knows everyone knows he can attest popcorn fanatic she loves the stuff oh me and her that's our that's what that's the number one thing share have eaten popcorn for din love for popcorn and we go to the movie theater she's like she said can we get a popcorn and I'm like I'm not your dad zipper 3 also does this it's like can we can we get a soda and I'm like just get a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you're a working adult just get a popcorn I'm so different than you guys cuz when she asked I go yeah a small though no you know what she said you know what she said she said said can we get a small popcorn I'm like get it you're going to finish it popcorn I just that's crazy if she say small I would chime in i' go let's do medium and I crazy that's what they want to hear I say do whatever you want I want nachos I'm in a Nacho mood I never get nachos at the movie theater ever but I'm in a Nacho mood I don't know what it was and I go up and I'm no no sorry sorry back up back up back up I said I want a warm pretzel and then I said no I want nachos and I looked to the menu I'm like a they don't have pretzels but they do have nachos and I'm like I'm about to I'm about to order the nachos I'm like and I look over and they do have pretzels I see them I looked at them late I'm like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they have pretzels too now you're in a constitutional Cris I'm like what am I going to do they have awesome looking PR they called it like Super Pretzel or something it was the most awesome name and I was like oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a Super Pretzel or do I get nachos and I went against my gut and I was like I'm going to get the nachos even though the Pretzel was the first thing I wanted get the nachos and I finished them before the movie started oh my Jes I finished them prev he's been talking about these naos like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to be clear to be clear all I said was I had the best no of my life and when I told them where they made it a long thing I didn't keep talking because there's a lot more question it's not fair to be like he keeps talking about it it's like you it keeps being pulled out talking about it right now like a religious experience you just lost all validation I used to look up to you man like when you say oh I never looked up to me I have when I would think of food places I would think of Nick used to look up your credibility on food Nick used to be a damn food fiend remember that guy let's get the Gordon for Ricky Ramsey went to the movie theater and was like this is the best [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hot dog I can't do the accident right now I've ever had it's the best [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hot dog ever fot dog I've ever put in me going that wouldn't he be like it must be must be pretty good yeah I would give it he has a so why is my you trust me with my food why there's a difference you had you had food social credit and you were in the but you didn't have enough food social credit make a Regal nachos you just went over the line clear Gordon would lose it he could do that like three times but if he keeps if he spams he's going to lose credibility kingling goes to the movie theater and learns what nachos are and eats them in that order yeah and then goes I had the best food today that's the opp we don't go they're probably awesome because he has no idea what nachos are so why on my side of the equation where I am a food critic would you not just believe they're delicious I'm sick of this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] B bit Nick engling has known about nachos for months okay I want to get that out of the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] way it was last August and it was the best day of his life [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mean to him for no reason yeah I saw him cutting a tortilla with scissors to try to make I don't I don't have big food expectations of jingling cuz you know he eats a damn Factor meal every day he's not he's not seeking delicious foods he's just seeking nutritious Foods you're kind of like a food guy man and I would try it I I wouldn't I I would be like okay I'll try this I like I'll try it like as a joke I will go right now after this I will go get them we should do a field trip we should all go see a movie together and get these [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nachos andal weat dude where the the theater we went to a long time ago I forget what movie we saw but we were with like Nick Allen and wrong cop my God and I went I can't believe I forgot to tell you guys this oh this is the greatest news ever okay that movie that night you know we had a big group Nick Allen Kelby all sorts of people my girlfriend Z was there my girlfriend thought Kelby was Nick Allen's son his big his big adult baby wish you guys like had pictures of these guys she told me this recently I was I I haven't I haven't stopped thinking about fun within two years apart she thought one Kelby was a large baby yeah and N was the oldest man on Earth Kelby is such a smooth man Kel's so old in a call one time he was making fun of me for being 29 and I said something as a joke I was like Kell you're 37 thinking it was a big number over his age and then he went dude come on cuz it was his actual age dude was his that's clean that's so funny I can't stop imagine Kelby with a binky dude he his face looks like a binky would fit in boss no mine doesn't yes you could fit a binky in that no it doesn't you think it's too a binky doesn't frame a my face so it frames Kel's face what are you even talking about at this point oh my I'm talking about Harmony of like circles and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] if he wore a bonnet I'd be like nice Bonet you you would just like Kelby to be dressed up in anything you funny I think you just wanted to you just like hurting him I was just like Kelly came in and he had a rattle like on his hi on his like Bell Loop there certain people feel good hurting makes you feel good no it doesn't Mak me feel good come on you know I certainly that's true whole line I can't hurt Kelby it it it's it's the it's the NorCal chuckle [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you know no no you know what he said the the other day I'm like walking out of here is after we did the Pod and I'm like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what's all these desks for man he's like yeah there's all these desks I'm like and he starts like barking at me about some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I bark back and I'm like all right I'm leaving and he he turns into he's like you know I just want you to sit next to me right and then I said I miss you too and I left the office I'm not saying it's not all love at the end of the day you still love ragging on them like it's a full-time job I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] chuckle [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and Yingling are different category I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] love ring oning they they both can exist I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] love that if you take away if you take that away from me I'll [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you up I will [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you up so hard I will [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kill you how are

can I say something how good are nachos ever really like really good you get fine nachos are always they're like these are fine I love nachos cuz nachos is the the appeal of nachos is that every bite varies in value and sometimes you hit a god nacho oh yes that has like cheese sour cream ground beef imagine a nacho [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] no this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] loaded like I ordered nachos you mean loaded it's nachos nachos with ancho they're my dinner this is hype myal nachos if you order nachos as your main dish at a restaurant for dinner you should be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] killed that's crazy I do that why is it crazy dinner what AM my five I think look if you're going as if it's your regular thing sure but like oh I guess I'll have nachos then it's it's it's tortilla with cheese meat and vegetables it's literally every Mexican dish you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stupid well well imagine you're at the Hard Rock if you load them up okay I'm at the Hard Rock my God all right and every meal is like the Elvis Presley Burger the the prince nachos going for the prince nachos is a fair play there you know what I'm saying I'm going you guys want to split the prince nachos I'm going to get the burger that's fine too to nachos aren't dinner it's just cuz there's numerous amounts of a food that you think it doesn't belong as dinner which is crazy you're in a jail of the Mind are chips and dip I've moved on from this I have are chips in dip dinner no no I I I think they can they're not nachos but nachos are no I'm saying both can be I've moved on from this shackles that we have as a society rench beans if I go to a restaurant now I I'm more often than not pick two or three apps as my meal dead ass that's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] woke way to live that's an wake world that you live in fcking so what I might do is I might pick the naos in like the calamari two or more appetizers combined to one person that is dinner that's so what I what so that's nachos nachos alone is not you could get a fat plate of nachos that could be your dinner Lo sometimes they're fat as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] if I'm at the bowling if I'm at the bowling alley and I'm watching It's A vibe thing it's not about if it's not about if I could take a knife to a taco and make it but there's certain restaurants which Vibes match it like the Hard Rock or a bowling alley or you know like depends where you're eating dinner or if you're eating movie theater dinner not the steakhouse if I cut your brain open there' be slave handcuffs on it right now cuz that's how you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] how would the how would the Handcuff my through the just be theit the wrinkles or yeah they're just embedded in their like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] teeth and gums no dude and that's how then that's how you live your life according to According to Jim I'm brave for saying nachos Brave I'm brave I'm one to three we're breaking oh you guys are all out of the Matrix oh yeah right I've escaped it no you're not

na I've had like nachos there's this place in Vegas that's like a nacho place but if you get a great they just have a ceiling a great nacho is going to be like I think where Shake got the burger I got nachos once they were great I'm dead ass you know how when you eat nachos it's like oh a soggy one and then it's like this one's the we' talked about that it's a Gamble and that's fun okay we talked about it 5 seconds ago I'm aware I'm making a comparison I didn't have a single nacho that wasn't perfect yeah that's because your nachos were consist when it's like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cheese out of a ro if there was fent in it they were perfect was white china I'm sorry this is your worst you haven't had this might be this might rival the Dr Mario take I was right we asked a scientist you're basically saying to me like you had consist this is actually the exact same as Dr Mario because we act Hank Green and he said of course not would behead you with a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sword I will go to this Regal establishment okay and I'll order these notos they sell for $8 that's actually a good question how much did they cost Regal Theater probably $30 a big part of like you know why is Inn out great it's not because it's the best burger All Time game of like the price influences the flavor I would agree flavor I I don't the thing is we don't need to go there Aiden because it's just insane it will lose on Merit you know what I agree we don't we don't they just that they just can't economically I had the best nachos ever I didn't say that dude you should just eat you should eat lunch Le cuz that's what you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's what you would lose your mind at yeah you'd be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] losing the little pizza You' be like guys you burst the door I'll be kick it open the best pizza pizza I specified they weren't pizza sauce all over his face they weren't lunchable nachos which I've had a lot of describe the nachos and the cheese pictures and you're like kind of like that kind like you put them in a pack-a-punch it's like a bigger lunch it is yeah it ismer you have the reg square like like vessel I totally will to try let me ask you a question you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Nazis let me ask you a question I I go to the movie theater right unsuspecting I'm like I'm going to get some shitty nachos I want some shitty nachos I get them and they're delicious what am I to do lie so you should say you should say dude the nachos actually packed a punch they were they pack punch like downplay why so flow embarrassed shame because I enjoyed because in the same way you just described it to us you go in thinking they're going to be shitty it's like actually they're way better than I thought and I cuz I had this growing up there was a chunky Cinema in New Hampshire and chunkies was one of the first Cinemas near me that offered food while you watch it was started by the guy that Aiden played basketball with it was he would punch you in the nuts and you walk in the door for half off anyway I the burgers from there were some of the Better Burgers in New Hampshire that I had access to and I always thought that but I was like they're not the best Burg had now what if what if you were [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crucified for that no cuz I wouldn't walk Jer you put on a big letter with your tiny little balls out you come in like you came in like Paul [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rever the nachos the nachos the best you ever had in your life that is crazy you came in the room said were the best you've ever you you live for 30 years on this Earth that's the crazy part if you said they were [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dope I we're sitting we're writing and I've probably said something really funny made everyone laugh recently and and I go oh my God this week at the movie theater I had like the best nachos I've ever had that's what happened we all we all to be clear it wasn't like that that's the crazy thing it wasn't like that it was like we like dropped what we were doing in turn like he said a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] slur like loud and proud yeah he's like I have a good idea for something the character should say say and we were like what what and it just became yeah it was an investigation yes it was you said the best not getting dominoes and being like you know is like some of the best pizza I've ever had you know what you say that was the best dominoes I've ever had in my life and that's that's what to say about chunkies so it's like it's awesome story oh I went to the movie theater I had the best movie theater nachos I've ever had I'm sorry well we were just talking like that was just our talking about our weekend that was literally The Prompt of like us all hanging out right and then he said some insane [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that we had to stop drop and roll that's all I'm saying it's just like it's just like some prophets there's some people who are going to follow me and they're going to try them and they're going to be like let's keep this a secret because there's people like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you guys the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the non-believers what do what [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mean you're the prophet you're the Messiah yeah and you have some followers who go to Regal Theaters and lose all of their money on Nach Judas I'm not Judas Jud calling yourself Jesus J Jud judas's brother judas's gay brother I'm Judas but he was like right I don't know I don't know how the story gay I'm on a big I'm gay Judas I'm like you're Sodom and gorra they were so good Jud and I had gay sexx with like another guy with Jesus you made yourself gay Judas I don't know you I already have a I'm already your gay brother yeah you're gay brother and you're gay judas's brother and we have Fu you are my gay brother but you're gay Judas [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] back we will go the nachos were gross we will gooss you're being don't be like that don't be like that don't do the face I'm sure they were pretty good I'm sure they were pretty good and I don't even think I'll hate them that much I bet they'll be tasty come on how about how about dude don't do this you're making your mouth all wide you're making your own noral of my mouth zipper look up the best nachos in La how about we do this how about we go to three nacho spots okay the Dei elevator Nick shouldn't have left us by ourselves breaking the thing at the mall it's right here it's right here it's right here is that upstairs yeah Mega Man drops January 6th oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] there's a sign it says gay say you're gay the time dude it's actually growing back in some spots don't say some spots oh that's tough that's a thumbnail that's a thumbnail this is why we need the Dei elevator [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we should have taken it cuz I'm overweight and you're bald and I'm bald and he's French we decid to actually do it we're here we're at Regal Theater this is the alleged spot where they make the greatest notches on Earth we're going to order some do we have to get a movie ticket movie ticket I think you can just walk in and buy food we've done this before what who years ago we were drunk with I think Nick Allen and my girlfriend we used to live and we went in I'm already tired hey can I get four of your best naos see I'm saying we need to call him bro my friend came here and he said he had the best nachos in the world that he's ever had but he didn't mention there was variety like to Doritos and all Hot Cheetos that's up to you yo what kind of nachos did you get just the regular one you want to get a couple of them do you want you mean varieties Welland you said tosos Doritos yeah I mean it's up to you you tell you tell us we're we're sheep theault and a cple one default and variety or two default and varities uh well we should all get our um two default and okay okay two of the default nacho yeah and then what's the popular varieties uh the one that people recommend or in general yeah recommended uh a lot of people you should like to get the toos and Hot Cheetos all right I'll get one of each of those then not to be crazy but look at how look at where they're stored in the nachos machine it doesn't really look like looks good looks good he said they were the best he's ever had so we're confused like you surely had these oh yeah would you say the best nachos you've ever had cuz they could be good I like them right like they're fine okay yeah would you say you could have nachos for dinner what's what's your stance on that could you have nachos for dinner probably not probably you think Dr Mario's a real doctor does he have a PhD this is a mini game it's a side plot does Nick recognize the difference between Coke and Pepsi yeah that's huge he'll be like this Coke taste weird or maybe he won't if he finishes this this is 7,000 calories I don't know what's grosser is him wanting this or Aiden getting a large popcorn for himself dude that's crazy now he's explaining he's explain explaining you look insane okay yeah that's a crazy frame dude you're a animal you're like a goat I I sometimes when I do this I think about how happy I'd be on a farm this was just me every day yeah eating popcorn from like a trough yeah I think I'd be happier dude it's it looks like Simpsons food it's got like a I don't like how it's not like um homogenizing it's not like flat feels like it's it's coagulating it looks like it's been it kind of looks like it's been pooped out like it's kind of squirted it looks good it looks like mustard like cartoon mustard wait did you did you did you just hum the the tune to hot person by Bobby Schmurda um yeah that's what that is yeah maybe and if it is what are you going to do about it I'm I just like this okay well we did it we went and got the nachos we have them Yardigans now are these what you described right yeah which on did you get the hot Cheeto ones Nick I didn't the hot Cheeto ones no this looks just what you got this looks that looks a little bit like it it like needs a mixing maybe but uh this is just maybe maybe maybe get a little bit of a sure yeah all right everyone herey look this is the it like Jiggles like jello yeah it looks really good it looks like my monuma is Revenge no we did we did ask the uh person at the front yeah if they were the best nachos he ever had and he kind of like fumbled like he couldn't couldn't answer could say that they weren't so you have somebody who works their kind of in your corner I think Loki was trying to keep his job that's what I thought too he like big Regal he's at the counter we were filming him at the counter he was very cool he was he was ultimately said I like them and he couldn't name a better not political answer he did say very cowardly them he said he nachos weren't dinner he did say that he also said Mario's probably not a doctor this guy sounds awesome yeah I think I'm starting to think you just like this guy I'm starting to think Nick paid for this guy be there no I I would have to have come earlier today and and met the guy and gave him money C he actually by cash I would have to done all that I didn't do any of that guys this is so hot I think we should dive in dive in hey I'll hold it I'll hold it I want to papa wants to buy it give it a mix though yeah that'll change it so much the ratio you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the ratio I'm just I I I had to mix it ratio uh I'd say like 25% cheese 75% chip oh dude the camera fell oh that's really funny okay hold this go it's okay we can still Salvage this Sal salvage get it off his fingers eat it off his fingers dude why did that happen it just didn't suck hard enough maybe because it's like a uh all right Aiden you're the cameraman okay you're the cameraman for the for the back one is so gross to look at this much cheese this is your are the best Naches you've ever had in your life this is not the context in which I ate them excited oh there's context there's the context yeah is it the movies are you not in a movie theater kind of guy who has like no tissues or napkins in his car or your glove box help man I don't have [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for you guys hey everyone in the car we're trying the naos what do we think I'm going crazy I'm so hungry I started laughing you're still you're still going in I'm only like nacho 7 okay and how does it feel in your body on your tongue so the nacho cheese has more of a kick than than I would have expected it's not just cheese it's a nice amount of spice right I don't know where they got that from I don't know where they I don't know where the spice comes from it's a nice amount of spice it's not crazy it's a nice not too crazy familyfriendly spice but it's a nice amount I think it's a toso the chips are good I was worried they'd be uh worse but the chips are actually pretty good I I am they're salty yeah there's a good amount of salt to them it definitely makes me want to reach for a a cup what if you uh now we got one special one what if we dove into this real quick dive into the hot Che you guys have a hot Cheeto version yeah it's just the same thing but they have Hot Cheetos with it Aiden what are you pointing the camera at not a second ago you weren't oh damn I have so much cheese on my hands wait the hot Cheeto one goes crazy hey here's here's an old Street trick you take off your sock and wipe it off on your sock that is an old you don't use your sock for the rest of the day and then you put your sock back on quickly and then it hardens wait the hot Cheo version is so much better whoa wait can I try yeah please this cheese okay here's my review this is the worst [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I've ever had in my this is really bad it tastes like rubber the hot Cheeto one is amazing I know the hot Cheeto one's way the hot Cheeto one might be the best the best hot Cheeto nacho you've ever had that's delici SAR I don't I've never had a better hot Cheeto nacho I'm comfortable saying I've never had a better hot Cheeto nacho I I am blown away and we're all in a resounding uh uh Applause we all love it well hold up when I switch back to the regular Tostitos my eyes are opened like like slime wow like if you go from the hot Cheeto and you're like damn this is flavorful back to the regular you're like damn this tastes like melted plastic the original is excellent no you are crazy origal plastic is a good word LG it tastes like it's that it does taste bad but the hot cheetah ones again really good really good yeah I think you guys just like Cheetos no eat the Cheeto without the cheese with the cheese is better to do you want do you want a hot here have a hot Cheeto I'm telling you this this is good this is good [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and you guys said the the Regal guy knew you guys okay I get it you see the hot Cheeto like has some weird chemical property that like activates it's like the mitochondria for the cheese it starts like fizzing when it combines with inter it's a chemical effect you know and I was I talked a lot of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] until I tried it now I that's so interesting but I swear to God you go back it's like using rubbers again and you you know you used to think it was sick but like this is this is nothing like busting inside yeah at all even a little bit not even a little bit it's weird cuz the cheese tast this is pulling out with a condom cheese tastes worse pulling out with a condom without is it R the condom is and it smells like rubber too much it's not ribbed no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm not going to lie for either's either's pleasure guys I'm trying to start the New York off right oh my God Dr Robotnik Dr Robotnik from Sonic 1 not two and three where he gets the crazier mustache Sonic one Sonic yes I'm a much Slimmer masculine Dr Robotnik I don't think one of those is right keep going well okay Dr Robotnik I know you want to take over the world but have you noticed recently that you have like so many unwanted subscriptions that you have forgotten about you so much you have so much less money in your account oh God no evil weekly and and double watch.com I hate Sonic crunch R too yeah crunchy roll you're watching anime that one's got to stay okay well you can keep you don't have to get rid of all them but there's so many you don't know about we don't want to keep track of it cuz we don't like working with evil people anymore over 74% of evil villains and normal people have unwanted subcriptions they don't know about you have you ever guys maybe thought that Sonic is evil no well no but I have thought thanks to Rocka money at least I found the subscriptions I don't want anymore that's a good thought Sonic the Hedgehog well you're more of a shadow Vibe or Knuckles Vibe I'm Knuckles Vibe well rocket money is a personal finance app that finds and cancels your unwanted subscriptions monitors your spending and helps lower your bills so that you can grow your savings or hatch the evil plan we work together isn't that our thing uh I'm genuinely cool with Knuckles most of the time Sonic is the guy I do not like and I if I could have his head removed from his body and put in some sort of microwave I would do that how much do you think you spend on on subscriptions Dr bonic and evil things prob five or $6 I don't know yo it's over actually closer to $300 300 yeah I know don't throw up yeah scream that's so much money for my plans I know so if you if you here's a couple things to think about one what if Knuckles dried you off two rocket money has over 5 million users and saved a total of 500 million and canceled subscription saveing members up to 740 a year when using all of its apps features it would hurt cuz he's got like spikes on it let me help you let me tell you where to go if you if you want these types of savings Dr about you're can go to rocket.com theard cancel your unwed subscriptions and reach your financial goal go S faster with rocket money go to Rocket money.com theart I guess me being evil was just a way for me to lash out at my own insecurities Argie zoom zoom and music Rocket money.com theard I guess Sonic isn't all that bad back to the episode guys can I be honest with you yeah so uh so the day I went and got nachos I you know I was pretty hungry I won't lie I was and it was a special moment and don't get me I stand by what I said but then I went to the movies again two days later really I went again and I said I'm going to get another another plate of that did you go to the movies to see a movie or did you go to see a movie and I was like I'm going to get another plate of those little nachos and I'm going to you know cuz I like them so much and then I got them and I was like these are normal nachos I I was hungry okay that's not to say that I don't think they are quality cuz I do I think for a movie theater nacho for a I'm watching a baseball game nacho in real time we are watching the goalpost move did you see okay for one I'm admitting I'm wrong big for him to do so I'm not going to sit and Chas tomorrow mov the gost if he's just saying he's wrong true I I don't I am what I stand by is that in eating the nachos they were my best experienced eating nachos ever stand by that do I think cuz you're watching Sonic 3 do I think if we enter what no it was a Kiki Palmer movie if do you think if if I think do I think if I enter these into a contest with all the other nachos in the world they would win no I feel like I don't think I ever I don't think I ever genuinely I think you were saying that we were looking at pictures of gourmet nachos and you were like trying to throw up we were talking like it's all on tape bro looking I guac and you're like what what is green look at all these vegetables low key I don't really remember that you saw ground meat and you thought yuck gross is terrible the ground meat's not the problem what what what is the problem man it's like when they put olives on it and then like also like when you get restaurant nachos like half of them are soggy only like the top layer is actually like the good ones I don't I don't like the mentality behind it it's a gamble like we said we were talking about this and nachos shouldn't be a gamble they should be a right Nick what you have on your finger is one of the grossest things human Humanity has ever made you look like Shinji like I I know I know deep down you hate this no I don't hate it oh there's dude there's she's all over my like shifter yeah I got to clean the car that's f um um these dude did you see the machine this came out of these are barely I don't ask questions like that I don't want to see the machine I don't think you should ask questions just saying it was in front of us there were no questions to ask was an eyeline because if you start ask questions about wag you beef it's not going to be fun questions they made pretty out of dude the sludge dude okay I argue snow piercer but it's just these nachos here's my here's my radicalized extremist opinion these are barely nachos these are like not even like whatever these are nachos asteris so shocked garbage food I'm so shocked that you are the leader of this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Ty I understand systems okay systems and Order and and if and if I'm eating in shapes and shapes and grits and I think if there was a shape with a specific hole I could match up the shape to the hole I could easily match the shape to the whole I like to call things what they are and it's like oh I had some chips and cheese the other day and someone's like nachos I'd be like no I no they weren't that these aren't nachos dude they're just not they're borderline they're like so close to not they're closer to not being nachos than they are nachos the comparison I told you I'm an extremist this is like this is like if if when we were walking over it's like if you came in and told us I just had the best burger I've ever had and like you did at LAX at one time and then when we went to go get the best burger you've ever had it was the hamburger at McDonald's it was like it's not a not not a quarter powder just the hamb the Hamburg hamburger the small hamburger this is the same thing as post Malone like you sit around you you say post Malon [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sucks this is not the white IR we should kill white guys with cornrow and then one day one day you're sitting around and W Iverson comes on at the right time with the right amount of Moonlight and and your girlfriend just broke up with you and and you realize he's kind of the man I want to be so clear when I put a hot Cheeto in this cheese and I eat it something is sparking in my it's like it's like Disney Magic like from the old times it is a if I could but when I put if I were to lick the cheese off of the chip I might throw up so I don't know how I don't know how both of those things are Happ it's once once the two come together it's like Ratatouille it is like when matches up the two flavors Dam like ratat the nacho cheese is good no no dude I love trash food and I hate this and that's I I'm not trying to be right I'm just being honest have another bite here's the thing me and Aiden have have devolved to doing the same thing which is we'll take a hot cheetah we'll put it in the cheese and eat it if we want a chip we eat it without the cheese yeah I like the chips can we talk about the chips alone just for a moment well they're Tostito it's just bag chips just buy this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] oh yeah at the restaurant they're making the chips Aiden this is rarely sometimes I don't think it's R sometimes they do they get some nicer chips most PE most restaurants are dumping Tostitos for their nachos and they're making the cheese and the toppings he's right you know what I'm realizing I'm a nacho ficado because I no because I when iici nacho when I get aici nachos I like them I I eat more nachos where they make the actual goddamn things in there more than IE ones where they get them from the back you're doing the slime thing I'm not doing a I'm trying to be with you but you're making yourself escal evangelist trying think is crazier to say I'm saying my these are the best nachos ever or that they're not nachos these are the best nachos ever is crazier than they're not nachos yeah categorically I think categorically sometimes the altright the altright wins is a situation where the altright wins they had a good point like Broken Clock type [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they're like they're just chips they're just chips and like synthetic cheese that you dip them in which is not what nachos are most of the time it's like makes me sick I have to go with Y all right here you were wrong to put trigger warnings on food during Ramadan that was too far it was just ridiculous it just a little silly it was just a little much all the other [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm cool with you know I had to draw a line somewhere me personally that was it this is okay let me this thought experiment for you nick uh if you were at home and you had Tostitos nachos and you had spray cheese from from a can and you're spraying the cheese onto a nacho individually and eating them which is a fine snack would you call that nachos good question I think you're associating the act of Dipping with the nacho which is frankly disgusting I think nachos are tortilla chips and cheese and you whatever cheese you use is just so yeah what's a tostada what's a okay you really want to get into you really want to get into when Taco become a burrito ass argument is that what you want to do burrito is a taco isn't it burritos are no teally Burr is what happens you you break families up is what happens and I'm not going to do I'm not going to play don't know what a is I'm not going to play I'm not trying to be a debate Lord okay but like I think it's a word for like a thick man what's the difference between spray cheese with home chips LCA do not to be made with nacho cheese they're often not they're often made with like four cheese and cheddar and and you know they don't require Nach I feel like nacho cheese is a synthetic creation you want me to grab yeah this is gross no but isn't isn't that what nacho cheese is no what is nacho cheese nacho cheese is the cheese that appears on the nachos just whatever it is any format that's what I'm saying right that's wrong nacho cheese is specifically like this emulsified cheese yeah that's what it's saying it's synthetic that is not that is what nacho cheese is so when you're saying what's a nacho and you're saying if I put synthetic cheese on a chip I'm like well that's it's kind of the spirit of great I mean would you say would you you get a call from your boy yeah and he's like what are you doing bro I'm about to finish gooning let's hang out and you're like I'm eating nachos okay look if my boy used pistachio milk to make cereal I'd be like why yuck that's but it's cereal why it's more like using Dr Pepper to make cereal no it's not like that it is not like that it's like using pil that's closer that's closer these are so the hot Cheeto one is genuinely so good these guys haven't eaten all day you're just eating [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you you've been starving all day and you found a dead rat and you're like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rat's good bro rat hits why don't they tell you about rat growing up I'm telling you if you go to a Regal theater don't get the nachos get the hot Cheetos with the nacho cheese insane they're so good I'm going to go back to this now I just ate a bunch of hot nacho I'm going to say something those are the best nachos I've ever had my God the hot Cheeto Booms for me the bo here's the question is hot Cheeto nachos nachos cuz like they're not CH why would you take this away from Chester because Chester has a lot Chester is not want he Tri to do I'm trying to make rules so if Chester was poor you would allow it it's Chester's it's you know Chester he's a self-made let me drink from my Coke you think Chester's selfmade Chester of course he's self-made Chester is not self-made what is CH what who what do you mean Chester is not self-made his parents worked at rathon no well but they didn't give him any of the money from that no but they made him get a job look Chester's nepotism aside my question is are nachos with Cheetos consider nachos or say sayage call them something else chachos so okay it I think if we work backwards if you were to have tortilla chips and then you were to spread hot Cheeto dust on it that would still be nachos so what's the difference about just swapping them [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out with hot Cheetos all together my God he's cooking you he's cooking you I do think Cheetos are chips yeah I think it's ch a weird family chips I think they're a type of Chip I think they they yes slim I don't know where are his Li what okay so dots aren't gummy candy and Cheetos aren't chips I see slime likes to organize things of course I do he likes to organize things in like things making sense distinct categories and if we start blurring lines we get a whole of God forbid that would be bad world we need to divide the lines one thing can't be two things at once unless a cubit oh God he's watching videos I want to say we got about as the only latinx person in this car certified good nachos with the hotos I I refuse I refuse for them to be called that I refuse I'm you're not call it a SN snack I'm latinx he's not you can't say latinx dude we he said Latin next is a joke uh on the Pod a couple weeks back and people were messaging me it's like bro don't say that not cuz it's a problem it's just that a lot of people hate it a lot oh yeah they just hate it yeah they just think it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but we say it as a joke yeah yeah of course but I thought it was really funny like we had a lot of push back but that one that one had some specific got Spice to it push back which was interesting they're not nachos okay go we're going to go around we're going to go around everyone give their one to 10 rating not in alltime food in nachos yeah yeah of course of course all right starting with well Nick please having it having had it for your third time now that you have your post nut Clarity on the nachos you don't have a movie to distract you you don't have presence of great friends to bounce up well I guess you do are there any are there any breasts in there movie if there if if there was a movie toct me dude there's so much cheese I didn't even see there's a lot of cheese there's a lot of cheese so much chees I saved a decent amount of it but all right yeah H hit me hit me um guys seven seven seven this tastes like a toy T put a toy in my mouth okay slime I think it might have lead in it uh I give this it's it's funny because again my standard for a lot of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is low like I I I'll eat a lot of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] if this is in front of if this is in front of me no this ain't you don't talk about yourself like that don't bring yourself standards dude yeah even though you do have a fingernail in your car I don't believe what you're saying that's a freaking snack for the car it's in the cheese a little bit there's so much bro uh I I give these a a a strong two to a light three yeah dude these are bad these are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bad I'd rather be eating totinos at home with spray cheese individually and we can call that nachos now cuz everything I guess is because we're merging everything there's 100 when I eat steak and rice that's nachos now that's nachos because the rice is the the cracker rice is the chips and the steak is the chees I guess that's what we're doing cuz they both come from cow see you're getting it I'm running for govern ar your rating the OG OG this chip with this cheese yeah is a strong four out of 10 it's almost a five it's a strong four out of 10 get me to five baby get me to five five is average imagine them piping imagine them piping you could eat this like every day make that much better the hot Cheeto is a n out of 10 so interestingly well like it's better than almost any nacho I've ever had it's really I think it's so good you're reaching so far do you know was made by a Mexican is that what upsets you yeah yeah like they CU they don't have Mexicans in Sweden yeah it didn't come from your white ethnos State yeah you want to rename it a hot American Golf Cheeto I don't to watch the Georgia Lopez Show I don't know why he has always a low riding on the trampoline I are the trampoline everyone so yeah what do you think Aiden let's flip it that camera I think this is coming in this is coming in what let's let's talk about what might be good you know I'm thinking about the what's the worst nacho I've ever had and the problem is the worst nacho I've ever had is probably is isn't far from this I think it's like wetter soggier versions of this with like staler chips yeah like if they didn't separate it yeah it's like if someone left this out for a while that would be a one that would be a one and I think these are coming in at a nice three that's what I was saying com I can handle these just a hard three I think a one you throw up like you can't eat it this is sitting exactly in the pocket of I would never ever spend money on this but if they were sitting out I would still eat them yes thank you I think we see really I'm one level above I would order them at like a Dodgers game if the alternative is like weirdly long hot dog it's just below hotg willingly order if they're giving me more meat and they're trying to save money I extra meat how you get that extra meat wait you can get meat on me no no you'd have to customize I get meat you you're saying we could go back up there and get some meat cut the imagine the hot Cheeto ones but with like some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] carneada on it now you're just building actual good nachos and you have some guac he's just talking about oh yeah and then maybe like a small set of maybe even a homemade chip we should we should do better cheese when we post this episode go back and see the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] awful lobbying you were do you're drunk rambling in the night it was disgusting what's the hot cheese a little bit of this watch what's that what's that rank I don't even like hot Cheetos that much and that's easy as seven that is at least a seven I'm right on I'm right on Aiden's tip here I think we his shaving his head has made me agree with him extremely we're very similar we're more locked in with we're borderline siese twins right noworder here's the thing cuz kind of the you know the essence of what I was getting at when I when I brought this to and confidence I'll say which has been betrayed was that a movie theater to my surprise is capable of producing a magical food moment dude the rewriting you guys are just having you guys are just having that moment with the hot Cheeto version the rewriting is magical it's not even the thing is though we picked this up when we went in the car it's not necessarily about we were actually going away from the movie theater experience we just got it at the movie theater C point is the the the the movies produced food that you guys rated above a seven when when you go so my hypothesis is not bad produce is such a funny word they just bought two items and smashed them together and sold it to a mark up makes me want so why is it so crazy if I like it huh best in your life that was the your life is insane that's why this all started that's what you said like 100 times it's not crazy that you like it we come together as friends I think I don't think I said that we have learned I don't think I said that oh my God what we have learned is that Nick has not lived a fulfilling life in many aspects and we need to hang out with them more there's holes yeah his human experience has like holes in it there's an easy explanation here Nick have you only had nachos like four times yeah right no I've had a decent low sample size we're trying to find you an out buddy my girlfriend who fell down the stairs and no one asked if she was okay uh she loves nachos and I will eat off her little plate so I've had plenty of Nacho in my time oh I've had many Dugout nachos I've had many movie theater nachos uh sporting event soccer game nachos um I've never made no I have made nachos making nachos I've made nachos with some like four cheese Nick with opinions like this you could be the GM of the Mavs have you guys ever taken like the the totinos nacho cheese stuff in the jar and then just dipped into it with chips yeah is that nachos okay oh is na lazy nachos po man's nachos I call it poor man's not cuz you didn't do the effort of just putting them I got a question I got a question swap that dip swap that dip out for a blue cheese dip is that a nacho a really gross way to make them I don't think that's a nacho anymore cuz I don't think blue cheese is it's still cheese no blue cheese dip is not cheese that's a dressing it's a dress yeah it's a dressing cuz cuz blue chees blue cheese dip I don't think it's like real blue cheese cheese isn't always you're dipping it in like goat cheese but probably what he's talking about but like unless you're talking about say crumbled blue cheese we're entering like Sherie territory what I'm trying to say is like when you start dipping your chip in white cheese but is it still a nacho I think the cheese has it can't be white the wh why can't it be the white cheese cuz the whites don't get this one the whites don't get you this one snowbody nacho mind control it could be called snowbody nachos snowbody nachos it's white cheese and you just cutting up Gudda wait hold on let me try one more thing of course the sweds trying to find a way to make it white yeah um that footage back there is going to be so unusable I think that's okay almost assuredly the big one I think you can put almost anything in nacho cheese and it'll taste okay except for these chips no this the chips are good well we got a lot of really funny footage when we were walking and and hanging out and I I the the machine that this emerged from it looked like it belonged in a fact like a car like manufacturing plant it's in like it was like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up like it was gross I want to show I want to show all the cheese in the console yeah it's like the villains Factory in a kids movie that just pumps out slug dude it was like it was like the power angels Ivan ooze like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like oh they're putting it in the water supply yeah it turns you into a donkey like in Pinocchio there's so much cheese all over your car that's all right call it call it all right hey everyone let me get this back so what did we learn we learned that Nick was wrong and even he thought he was wrong well maybe the commenters maybe our viewers commenters go to theat a Regal theater near you order the the nachos with code yard they're saying movies are and they're going to know what that means say i' like the code yard nachos it's 5% off um while cancel your Netflix subscription yeah and kill your parents Arie put a spiral like a hypnotic spiral kill your parents and eat the nachos and rate them in eight um yeah let us know what you think uh I I marked this one as a win for me personally that's crazy wow delusional I think we can all agree that I've once again proven uh I know a lot we got to kill that guy at the counter for saying we walked out with we walked out with this win Nick did you like your soda yeah into it it was pepsy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sure that's fine I like he didn't even difference what does that matter you Pepsi me and I'm mad we just thought that a guy who thinks he's so perceptive might might take a look at the cup and this is your nacho leader this is this is who you listen to No delicious Pepsi I like Pepsi all right guys well thanks for hanging out uh again please I I swear to God if you go to a Regal and try the nachas we want to hear what you think cuz it's divided us like it's the most divisive thing we have ever dealt with the shot right there it's a good shot we're going to close on this shot close it out close it out Aiden all right thanks for thanks for joining us in the back of the car at Regal Cinema and we about and you can get nachos just like us if you head on over there so we'll see you next time for the Y tickle challeng the Y

that picture in the Google search and then go like open or something that that one's way too much sour cream and to be fair I don't really like that you zoom in I don't care if it's pixelated I don't care look at these pictures dude these look [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] click the top link yeah look Zoom oh my God this is rough it's going to look like that looks bad unless that's queso fresa in which case yum that'd be crazy okay what they blurred it like it's R 34 those look like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they look great I don't know what the problem with naos okay you know what I think I figured it out I
