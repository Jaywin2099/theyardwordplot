viruses the other day and I but I don't know the actual truth but what I do know is that why we refrigerate food is that it slows down the bacteria growth stop sleeping but if we also and instead of having fridges had Ovens that were 250Â° I'm going I'm going to blow your mind guess why we cook food no guess why you cooked a we all knew that right well one of us doesn't eat cooked food here so I would believe that person doesn't know well Factor Factor's cold meals are cooked they are cooked yeah dumbass kind of they've been cooked yeah they've been they raw chicken we're not just sending out raw meats the they're just MREs the the the food was cooked in the in the 50s yeah lowkey I think you would love to eat MREs every day you've eaten them I know aren't they gross didn't you hated it didn't you oh really they're what I thought put words in your mouth okay lunch Le mes and we send children into war but they have and they but they have primate Fe so they're so happy to fight for us

the Flies Lord of the Flies aircraft carrier led by the the rler it's not even close to Lord of the Flies because there is military hierarchy in rank he is a he is a War Admiral they are all kids 100%

game every single game dude lot weeks on your verbal T [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right now no I'm not are you are you're spouting off you're spouting off KSI lyrics no we're at basketball last night to from the from the from to the from the screen you guys don't even know itre to the to the ring I'm the king dude I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] love that guy saying it basketball last night I haven't even heard this song it is it is so bad but there's one 5sec part that hits like a like a jerk off that's all you need you only need the Tik Tok you mus these days you know what I mean but I I I was playing league and I was just Tim would play cuz he has audio control now every time I get a play he would play it and by a play I mean a kill or an assist or a dragon and Tim actually can't have cancer this whole thing will crumble it will yeah I don't think I can go back to not having Tim for sure but uh anyway the result was the whole stream got [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] taken down [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] KSI who now is your best [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] friend go do [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sidan [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I started watching KSI videos I should say I watched one now and and now yeah now now after the lunch Le stuff everyone like damn I'm not I'm mad at KSI for freaking lunch and the song is bad also and what he said to Dan and then sl's like I'm going to I'm going to watch what did you watch did you go back and watch like an old KSI video I had a very like forward moment you know I started watching I started looking at his YouTube after this I listen to the song I think I'm like one guy dude I know you from your music your YouTube Channel's fired I think that like you should do more YouTube for sure YouTube cuz I was like you know what I hear about this guy for some reason every week and I don't know what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he does I have no idea and today I'm going to learn so I watched him react to Tik toks okay and I was like did you laugh no okay you're saying it like it's a disc discover no not I expected as well but I was like maybe I wasn't trying to laugh I wasn't trying to be a hater either was he trying not to laugh too we played along yeah I was that was part of the the the fun you got to keep it going and I was like you know what I get it but it was just so interesting cuz he's like he's part of this like upper echelon of YouTube I actually explained K KSI I don't know it's just I would love to hear group is he in like dude he's associated with prime Logan Paul Lely play the game yeah uh that has association with Mr Beast there's damn feable in that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] D damn ass lunch who is he he's a guy this before this I have no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] idea isn't that crazy like that's why I think cuz he he used to be very liked okay he's been a creator for like 15 years he's still liked by many people to be clear sure but uh he was he's like a part of a group called siden British group that's the the soccer thing this how I interpret the world I understand what you're saying he was doing he but you know there was life before side he's the biggest member in siden he went from the screen to the ring he watched KSI open some packs on FIFA they're also the most popular uh channel in the UK they're has been a YouTuber for like 15 years a long it was was he doing Call of Duty stuff or FIFA what was the first he did gaming yeah well I fired up one of those videos and I was like oh he's British like like I didn't know yeah isn't that crazy I get you so actually he went from the screen to the ring and then he's been writing on the P everything he tou you he kind of the king so but but don't forget the bling I can't believe he used the word bling in a song and current it's kind of coming back though yeah I actually think we're at a point now where it's hard to write bad rap music like you can I think it's easier to write good music you think you think he threaded the needle on yeah so I think if he did that it's it's good it's impressive it's kind of cool being able to Bri it poorly is I should command him it's like Starving in America when we have [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] McDoubles okay like you can get it together you could just you could have just gotten McDouble yeah we there's a there's a lot of you know will you watch more KSI videos I don't think so no cuz you know what I went and turned on there's I think it's like game Master 3000 she does like in she's like no hit Mega Man runs and she and it's explains to you how to beat Mega Man 4 without getting hit they're good videos and I'm like you know what this is more my speed goodbye KSI I'll see you on the Doom the SS Doom carrier when you are also deployed to defend our beautiful country with the is deployed to defend the United States he'll join the United of America that's right Aiden because the UK will actually lose all their power I forgot he was American well they're they're losing their institutions lwi yeah it's their vacation their vacation businesses mhm the migrants and whatnot the migrants do you think we we as podcasters are obligated to solve the migrant crisis yeah but not the American one the UK one okay yeah yeah that's a little too political for do the US okay so next yeah season 3 the yard is actually going to be us podcasting on a on a raft in the mediterrane we're going to be God we're going to be pulling people out of the water and and saving them there's this uh very political podcast what's it called [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] no uh pod sa America PODS of America yeah and they got that who's the main dude John Lovitz don't know John litz it's not John Lovitz it is from The Wedding Singer John love it okay different guy close though all right John love it is this like former speech writer for Obama who is on this pod save America very political pod yeah it sounds like hardcore Millennial core it is as Millennial core Lial core as you can get but I this house we science is real he I recognize the weakness of liberals okay because he went on Survivor got last place o he got dead he got dead stone like like he's the first one voted off the island so that I'm never watch Survivor that means you're the most useless guy means you're the worst it means your team is the weakest team cuz they lost the Team Challenge and you are the weakest person on your team or the least liked or something okay and so he got kicked out early days I think the reason is cuz he rocks up and he goes I'm a podcaster yeah oh weak weak weak thing to say weak sperm weak genetics he's the dude wait wait you put John litz over it that's what the hell famous actor comedy John love itz from uh yeah that's great guy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I can't remember a single one right now though yeah me neither he he in a a show called the critic which was like The Simpsons but some would say funnier um yeah I think that if we went on Survivor I definitely would conceal who I was well it might be hard because I I text I'm doing a hang green show this week yeah he text me back he he say I'm on a playing the flight attendant says are you from the yard no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] way that's what I said cuz that's Han green I watch Green video last night dude that's awesome we own him that's this is like this is like the the flood attendant is like what slime does to KSI but to Han green yeah I started watching Han Green from the yard then I found out he's a YouTuber dude he's just done he's just done so much so much good yeah I feel bad that that interaction happened if anyone knows him from the yard I think you owe him to do a bit of research that it's a heat episode I'm not saying it's one watch more yard yeah F Hank Green watch more yard more yard like Hank yeah he can't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] responding me dude he sound like the nicest message about the show ever that was so sweet that was the sweetest message it made me feel so affirmed what he send the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you posted it you shared it with us I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hate you it's short memory because of all the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] IA you didn't even remember the Tim has cancer the DM the D know that d m that the DM that he sent you after he came on the show where he talked about how he thought it was really nice that we provide this like like a a space kind of a a a boys will be boys sort of space I'm desing it poorly it's so hard to say what he said space for mainly men and it's like you know antagonistic towards women and it's like a good place for cuz they're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cuz they're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] green said that he actually said he's like it's a bit antagonistic and then he stopped himself when you write and you say scratch that read writing this out very antagonistic no he just he he complimented us on a space that was like a positive space for masculinity and male friendship without being toxic in this area of social in this era of social media and hearing that from him specifically is something that I think will stick with me for a very long time it meant a lot to me and it's crazy because it's a DM to you that you screenshot that you shared with us and said it was a really nice message you don't remember me for years to come I can't believe that you go on a show and forget that it's also cap what he said cuz blood cries on this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] three times a damn [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] month not three times a damn month a few times a day a month I need some dank green it's been two times so I I have another podcast that I want to show you guys points lefta for two dank green that's two points of the board I'll give that to you yeah I want zipper can you please pull up what I sent you on Tik Tok can you search it on Tik Tok this is uh go go to Tik Tok first and my Lun had a vibrating egg inside of it just watch we can watch like any you could pick like any clip that has a lot of views on Tik so sorry for the vibrating eggs that got sent out oh my God the two projects we're working on were combined what a chance this is a disaster what are we looking at just click on anything that has a lot of views click on anything I yeah relatively a lot of views has a crush on Maverick no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] way have a crush on Maverick I will admit obviously like I had a on MAV very this no no shut up I want to watch I got to know what happens there's no way cuz she she's a Maverick true from the first sight what the so did you sit on the blue couch next to him happy face with B I was like guys I need to sit next to Maverick like I was like so so scared and who's Maverick oh that's the beginning of the lore isn't that the name of Logan Paul's kid Maverick's the guy that feeds them once a day dude what the hell is this okay okay I want to know more I would like to more have an initial question for you guys okay how old do you think the people on this podcast are they're in high school 25 22 you're asking because it's a surprising answer 24 it's I'm going to go college aged okay High School okay what you're all kind of right okay and that's what makes it weird this podcast is gigantic they have so many views on Tik Tok their YouTube channel mogs us okay it's insane how big they are the girl who has a crush on Maverick is what was that Zer getting excited you the girl who has a crush on Maverick is 15 but the other people on the podcast are 22 it's three 22 it's like two 22y olds and a 21y old and a 15year old this oh I don't and they do the podcast together and I don't I don't like that the set is clearly not a real house it's like in a warehouse somewhere dude they're doing hot chip challenge shut up I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] watching my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and then two of the 22y olds are married to each other what what dude it's it I don't know how they got here but it's a l I was like this is cuz I got shown the clip and I was like oh this is this is cool in a way I was like all these kids in high school made it big like it must be cool to be like 15 and just get to talk about 15-year-old [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and have a massive following on a on your podcast I you're so good faith you're a very good person CU I would see that and think this is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up they don't deserve this I went through a bunch of their content and I was like this is this is a little I would say brain Ry you know compared to Minecraft Parkour civilization which is an exercise in the mind and but then I found out that it's only one of them who's 15 cuz they talk about what she does at high school all the time and then the other ones are are they're adults who are married to own her I that's what I know Rel must be like a sister right no it's not a random 15-year-old they're all religious they're all like Christian so I don't I don't know what that that Wednesday night youth night they're all brothers and sisters under God's roof Seekers and sneakers apparently the the Harper the the 15-year-old girl is like the most popular member of the show and her she's like 10 million followers on Tik Tok 10 dude she she is massive and Maverick doesn't like her back and and they M our podcast they destroy us they mo lwig they mo they kind of Mo don't throw me under the bus here I'm just saying if we're talking about scale no cuz they're a podcast I don't really compete with them it's like a not it's a non-compete that's it's a non compete MoGo is a podcast mail is not a podcast yeah it's the Daily News it's the daily for aging Zoomers anyway we're open up applications any high schoolers who want to join the yard so we need a high schooler you must love God you must love God you must have a crush currently yeah I was going to say you got have a crush on someone whose name didn't exist 10 years ago on somebody no on somebody's like a crush on goose or somebody else from Top Gun okay that's CRA so how did this all make you feel uh it it at first it made me okay at first it made me happy because I was like I thought it was for high schoolers who just like made it big and I think that would be the coolest thing in high school if you and four of your friends just somehow did this sure the age discrepancy made me made it less cool it gave you pause it made me I was like this is strange now because you why are you as a 22-year-old hanging out with a 15-year-old day it's got to be industry planted and then what if the 15y old I started scrolling through more of the content and and I mean this genuinely I was like this this is slop like I think I think it is possible for Jen Alpha and I I get it I get it I also make the slop I understand that I make the slop I look sometimes I think it's CL slop oh I'm in the slop Factory I get it but I watched parkour civilization and I was riveted for 45 minutes I was and I was like by the way by the way it's a 2-hour video it's hm did you hear what it said I I have time I to go somewhere 45 minutes I watch my 45 go back to it did you go finish parkour up Wikipedia watch it two days ago I didn't look it up there all I'm saying is I think parkour civilization was kind of sick because I was like oh my God like like for all the criticism that adults give of like Jen Z Alpha content and what kids are watching I was like dude I think if I had a kid and they were watching this like I watch Satur Saturday morning cartoons I would be like this is like pretty great but I was like I don't know if I want them watching like 5sec Clips too young to become this much of a boomer what do you mean you know these 13-year-old I just said that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the kids are making good [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] no but they're also making like horrible horrible evil slop yes there's levels of slop there's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we do and then there's Mavericks well ironically I think kind of compelling that's kind of like that's D I would turn that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] off if my kid was watching it no this is this is one that tilted me one TT they have they have one where the kid one of the he's not a kid actually it's one of the adults when the adult gets up on a table says and he says I'm going to do a backflip off the table and the whole Tik Tok is him saying I'm going to do it and then them being like I do it and then he just doesn't do it and then that's the Tik Tok you got to watch for part two did you watch Z Zer can you pull up the YouTube homepage damn just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it just all of it just a straight up home page let's see what you got going let's see what the recommendations are I love when he gives a cold read of a of a scroll down scroll down the left no no no I want that left bar I want that left bar go to a go to a live live yeah yeah now scroll down to to to like live like actual live and then hit the view more okay what are we looking at okay go to games go to gaming go to gaming go to gaming we can save this we can save this Zer me and you we can see this okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah click that yeah yeah click that click that yeah yeah yeah yeah click that top live games what are you what are you trying to get chill chill chill the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out all right let him cook I'm I'm done no no now click on GTA 5 what a good UI this scroll in is it for is is it this changed my life forever on how I view YouTube creators okay because if you want to talk about slot for the piggies uh you can click [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] people are making more sloppy slots you can click any any of those look at the motorcycle one I like motorcycles God damn it uh you have to watch this okay you have to support a Women's and Children's crisis shelter e hold up I got to write this down that's yes on a women's okay what's wrong with this he's playing Minecraft children's crisis does this change your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] life um this isn't it zipper the motorcycle he clicked on it this the motor it's not the motorcycle oh right what okay wait this is actually also fine [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] never mind what are your what point there's just a bunch of live streams on YouTube that is just videos repeating for children whoa that it's it's like sensory videos okay why live uh cuz they get more ad Revenue because they can just repeat the videos forever and the kids will just keep it on forever until they die forever oh my God the ads play again on second watch they just it's just a live stream that's more villainous slime right just keeps also also for what it's worth I think if they all were in high school if they were all like 15 or 16 I don't think that's slop I just think they just kids doing kid just kids doing kid [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but I think as soon as you you're married and you're 22 and you're making a podcast with a 15y old fre 22y old be a freaking kid is it slop I think I should be a kid at 28 personally but why why uh why is is it is it slop if there's an adult that runs the whole thing I was going to say I think as an adult but the content's not different no because it it still is different if even with that lens like if you watch something and then you learn that an adult orchestrated this thing it makes it different even if it's identical but a kid does not care about that context at all exactly I think that's why I'm in the camp I feel like I I maybe I'm foolishly applying like a layer of Innocence to like if a kid makes it it's like you're a kid having fun these 15-year-olds aren't setting up [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Flats in a warehouse there's an adult room but as soon as you're but as soon as you're a 22-year-old crafting content in a certain way you have the autonomy everybody it's called top or slop I'm going to give you some you tell me if it's top peak or slop one person on the show is 15 but they will not play we cannot have a show called Topp or slop talking about 15 yeah this is bad do it you got it let's here we're going to put we're going to put like one a series of dotted lines before I go to my next paragraph and and we're GNA and we're GNA okay Chom new episode topper slop oh it's like name for it then yeah yeah we do yeah how about copper slops been canceled to all our viewers we are so sorry it's slop mostly boom or Doom iom all right I Carly I Carly is it boom is good boom boom I it was boom well no it's not it's Doom because of what that awful man did to those [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] poor kids this is exactly where I brought it up cuz it was made by an adult man who's also a creep does that make it different now uh yeah no no it's different so it's boom Doom it's boom because that show that show has like actual like writing and and narrative cont I think show is great i' say boom but it's not made by kids do you think that is that the crazy picture Christ I don't like how he's next to the wall hey guys he's like at an Apple store do you think this is lwig trying to leave when Aiden's trying to get his attention it is yeah you told me you tell me to get my dogs out before you before you take off God damn he's weird wait do you think my point is that if it's made by adults it's slop always and if it's made by kids this is just something slime brought up so I said I Carly no look welcome to Boomer Doom guys you guys can't freaking handle one curveball it's more I was I was saying my point I was trying to make is there is an obligation implied when an adult is making content containing kids or for kids or and or both right and we we extend criticism to my new favorite YouTube YouTuber KS I make content containing kids cuz he's he's put he's making lunch Le and they're popping primes in that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and people are like why are you why are you interested in selling things to Children cuz there's this idea that like well they're they're new and that's and that's the sloppiest slop in them all and I think we are more sensitive to that and that is what Aiden experiencing so I was and when you get older you experience that more you're like oh this kind of grosses me out these this 22-year-old owns this like slave 15-year-old it's like not a slave I don't think that's the case well we what don't we don't know you jumped you jump to a different conclusion I say that cuz it's really funny to say that but it also feels like a 15-year-old answering to 22-year-olds doing content doesn't feel right also Maverick [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] text her back man mavi like just respond freaking effed up that you she's famous as hell yeah yeah Maverick thinks he's hot [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] if he's not talking Maverick must be bigger 20 mil Maverick said his own podcast oh dude maver talk Tom Cruz he's talking about how he needs it needs to be an F-15 even though it's 2024 doesn't make any he's also nervous about joining the wrestling team you're talking [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Aiden I feel like you'd name your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] little dumbass kid Maverick oh my God yeah hell no that movie sucked what would you name a kid torbjorn Tor what I name my kid kid Neta my name backwards nice dude just that's good that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] beast so conceited and Beast what are you naming your kid lwig junor J Jun yeah lwi the thir yeah the thir there's Jun ex be so you got skip one you got to skip one you got to skip one you got no disrespect to lwi Jr I just can't look my kid in the eyes and then he'll be like Dad why am I lwi theii and then gol it well it's cuz Nick's puff mag when I when you were old enough I was going to show you this video it's a 45 minute combo video only vers FAL W dashing under the Falon this is your older brother he's dead now yeah he's been gone for a long time uh but maybe you can Will him back dude yesterday I uh so my neck's been hurting really bad I've been like sleeping weird and I keep waking up with neck pain and I was like okay I had some time I'm like I'm going to go get a massage maybe that'll like fix it and and it's really hard to in LA to book a massage the same day they're usually all booked up so uh I scrolled I scrolled the depths of Yelp until I found a place that would take it I found a place it was like probably 17 in not that low um I go uh no one there really speaks much English and I'm like I'm like yeah I have put online do speak uh I don't know be honest to you you don't know the language Tai okay okay I think was mang there okay that's racist we've shifted it to him um that's not racist R mang is Tai that's racist mang is a I think expecting him to be there is racist it's a her mang is a woman sexist racist to um and uh uh she's trying to explain something to me but she's not speaking English so I don't know what she's saying so I just say yeah yeah sounds good and so she okay great we go to the back and uh I lay down I feel like I was in a friend's episode we lay down or I not we I lay down and uh I a woman comes in I like I hear her come in and then all of a sudden she crawls up on top of the table and then she gets on top of me mhm with her knees and her elbows and she's balancing on my ankles so she's like I'm laying down on my stomach and she is balanced just on my legs with her knees and her elbows and she starts walking up my legs all the way to my upper back does this happen instantly this is the first thing that happened crazy that is not crazy it is excruciating pain youpp okay yes this is my a story about my first tie massage I have never had one this is literally what a tie massage is I've never had one it it hurts it's like it's like you walked in McDonald's you're like they made the food but like they didn't even make it it was ready before I got he it up and they just heated it up at either I KN the craziest [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I've ever had get this I didn't know they just rip it without talking God damn it just people on people so yes my first time getting time that is the story wow that's fun uh and I'm an excu she's climbing all the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] over my favorite part of the story now is speaking I don't know Ty well you nailed it that's cool didn't nail it and so and did she walk in with a Pym hippo under her arm this is that's is that racist not everyone in thail as a piggy dude TI did you like it they suck on dude it was awful I was trying to explain really he did cut him off he was about to tell you that it absolutely did not help with my neck pain no uh at one point I well I should have know cuz when I walked in I noticed that there was bars on the ceiling and I was like oh it's like the air conditioning but it was actually to hold on to for her because she's going to start walking soon dude so she starts no way so she starts [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] walking on my back like she is like like like completely walking up and down my body and I've I've I've gotten like a decent amount of massages in my life and I was I've never really had to like tap out and I was just like I need I'm sorry can you go a little softer dude it was so painful it was this woman was like 4 fo2 and it was the most painful experience in my whole life basically sheot like 80 lbs that's what I'm saying it's like why it h like what dude uh and so I I endured about an hour and and I was like okay that was off one I don't think I'll do that feel good now but also respect cuz I I couldn't put in that much thing about thass is it's like uh so you have one it's like oh yeah and you like that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] no I hate it I hate all massages though but it's kind of like it's like smoking marijana temporar never good the first time oh you

was like can you go a little bit lighter and she laughed nice get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I think spit on me it's like when you ask it's like can you do not spicy and they're like yeah dude do you do chicken nuggets here yeah I I did I mean it's my fault I did select the deep tissue massage but normally that means like it's kind of like you know getting hot sauce at like McDonald's it's like you know yeah

are you kidding me dude we've talked about this on this week love that it's hard to remember so many pods dude I'm that's why I don't get mad at lwig all the men is so many I was thinking about how um this whole podcast not podcast this whole world we live in would be so different if loveby wasn't a YouTuber but he was a rapper dude oh my God I don't think I could be a rapper like he love big hits up me and you and he's like I'm coming to La I want to be a rapper and we're like yeah you can you like let's get a place together like we'll support you you can like he gets fired from The Vape company and he's like I think I'm going to do this rap [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm this rap [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] full time I think I think we're probably all still in the Inland Empire yeah yeah for sure would I be your you think I would stay your manager producer you'd be my you no you definitely be my you'd be my manager send me gigs and then you would like talk to me backstage after like seven people show up you be like dude it's GNA hit though oh and you got to figure figure it out as you go like like Atlanta yeah dude that was I you know that uh video that old video of Nickelback playing a show in Spain and he gets a the main lead singer gets a rock thrown at his head what the hell that's awesome can you look this up zipper it's a very classic video Nickelback rock head uh ban he's like you're all ready to hear some nickel back tonight he's he's it's funny he talks like he sings he's got a very strong voice and then someone hits him with a rock does he get mad yeah he says that's it good night and they walk off oh that's beast that's crazy yeah that is Beast they probably beat the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of that guy in the crowd I'll wait for zipper to well that's n hit with rock look how old this is video we even see the yeah this is old [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all right oh they just done yeah no no no no this has not happened now yeah have we got any ni in Portugal Portugal sorry puges are you sure up to you you guys want to hear some rock and roll or you want to go home he gave him the option so there was there were inte is see and then the drummer flips him off yeah Chader dude they didn't even want to do the show okay so I read an interview that popped up later on and he talks about this he's like our manager signed us up it's like a death metal show and he was like he's actually cool about he's like you know what if I'm a death metal guy I don't want to see nickel back either I'm not going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with you and it was a manager fault so we had a big talk with him about that it's like don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sign us up for [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I was thinking I would never do that to you you would never get hit with a rock no no dude that's so crazy you're reading this you're like no no that's the connection slime does this though cuz we went to an improv show dude I knew You' say some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we went to Ben Schwarz oh my God and and it was bro if you've never seen Ben Schwarz live he's coming near you you got to watch it's very funny and uh and in it they do maybe 30 30 minutes of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] jokes maybe 30 minutes was it was a good chunk of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] jokes 30 minutes is you're an insane person for [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] saying that you effing insane person over the course of 30 minutes they did about four to five [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] jokes okay and they were just talking about draining their balls of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and that if you drain your balls of come you will fly to Heaven yeah because [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is what weighs only thing weigh down yeah awesome bit and and then then the moment we leave we are all alive having a great time Sim's like they're just like us we're the same because they just made [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] jokes that's not why the reason why I said that you thank you creamer for bringing this up thank you I would love to talk about this creamer because the reason why I said that is cuz they hit a lot of notes we hit literally yeah what notes they did [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a wugo thing with the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cartoon but he did it in such a beautiful way talking about come talking about all these things we hit so many thematic elements balls too and also come not even to mention the AOA part the crash [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like wasn't even where we overlapped I felt like I was like dude we are the yard version of this now I'm just I'm kidding but I thought there were similarities and it inspired me I was like that was really good one day we can be as funny as them and that was what I was trying to say so now it's wholesome and you're trying to bring him down but you wanted to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you wanted to make it about and then you know what we did afterwards guys where we go you want to know want to know do you want to know what was suggested to do after this what was what was after what was after slime where did you go we went to eat ice cream in Downtown LA of course we became creamers that night real creamers are allowed to go lwig and was Irish today I'm just a boy but I have cream as well so you got a double scoop oh that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] say that I don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah I got double scoop cone because you know what [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I had this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] once every [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] damn Blue Moon D was the last [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] time you got cream last time I was with you oh God not be kidding and we were in line and uh we were looking at the menu and I'm like oh cool they got a milkshake I'm going to get an Oreo milkshake and I was like you think they have oat milk and everyone turns to me like what are you talking about I didn't do this oh my what are you even saying milk ice cream place and I was like yeah they do that and everyone's like and then cutie spit on me CU spit right on spit into his mouth from like 5T away I like how Nick's past version of himself is so self just like yeah they do that yeah I was like as opposed to the reality which is Nick being like what yeah they do you can get heavy oat milk heavy oat milk I didn't say that you said heavy oat milk I didn't yes you did no Christian said heavy oat milk I said joke and I I laughed we you know what we have a truth problem and then I show I told the truth well we don't know say I was in there and I don't no you represented yourself as someone who's like yeah we someone to follow us maybe a 15-year-old who's on the Pod with us and TR Keepers our truther and they're and they love God that'd be so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they can't Li cuz they love God they can't cuz God would punish and they can't and they can't record the pot on Wednesday nights cuz they're at youth group that's youth group I haven't I haven't won in this story yet let me let me um so so I uh I get through line and I'm like I'll I'll get a Oreo milkshake and then the woman goes uh what of milk do you want and I [Music] I turn around at cutie and she's just like no way seething you know what's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up is I didn't even know that happened really I no I was ruthlessly making fun of you and then I just forgot and and I was like I was like I'll take oh and she's really confused why I'm so happy about it and then cue's like I'll also take an Oreo milkshake normal milk and I'm like don't think you're getting me don't think you're getting me by not also getting it I'll have it normal milk I guess I have to say that I guess I have to say what kind of milk I want in in Liberal California you do you you you say that jokingly that's how I feel every time the person asks me what milk I want my coffee dude there is a stump town in LA and written on the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] board with all the drinks it says if you do not specify the milk you want we will give you oat milk by default that's no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's crazy and that's crazy this is the crazier part boys is I go there and I order and they say what kind of milk do you want why ask because they get too much [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] if there's a whole thing the smoke then remove it then remove it and just do default milk like every other shop it's hard it's like you put a message in the slack it's like all right submit your expenses at the end of the week you still got to message people you still got to be like you got any expenses at the end of the week it's just humans aren't good at TH those systems this is a liberal California issue only there's no University go to Texas the dys in holl the dys in holl my God they don't have oat milk they don't have oats you get coffee you oat milk in Florida they kill you yeah put a bullet in your head they give you a reprogramming yeah [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you got to go you got to go to re-education it's it's privatized use the Asia you ask for oat milk at a coffee shop they shoot you in the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they blow your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up smooth one L one L uh so yeah we
