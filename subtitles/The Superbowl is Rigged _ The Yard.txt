monstrosity of a CRT upstairs in this office and that's kind of how people look at that CRT is like how they built the pyramids yeah it's like a feet of strength was that just Manpower it was it was just raw men and what sucks is that they did break it they in the process of taking it upstairs it's and now we just have a broken large CRT no I thought Nick fixed it oh we found out that it can't be fixed we tried what yeah yeah he went on this like CRT journey of like trying to figure it out he can't he's not here right now so we just say he failed yeah he failed didn't do it he sucks and he's

you have pizza look up ass pizza maybe look up ass piz Pizza ass this is like ass Pizza yeah my bad it was ass Pizza Pizza is this is fashion I thought it was pizza I actually kind of like that shirt can you uh so it's this 26-year-old who puts the hardies logo or Carl's junor logo on shirts and then and then spray paints it and I only know this because Stadler got it for me as a gift oh and I was like cool and I thought it was just like a thrift like I thought it was just like a random it looks like a terrible quality shirt right and then Alex walks in and he goes dude you got a ass Pizza shirt the tapped in 30-year-old Alex very tapped in instantly starts hyping up my shirt and so now I have a cool shirt and you don't uh it looks like your emo it looks like the brown star yeah I thought that was what it was it's like one of those old like Dock and punch I hate to pull the wool over the eyes I did steal that picture my emote comes from Carl junr no what I also realize is the brown star emote is not a fun thing to explain to people yeah yeah it's it it's funny it gets worse the older I get like as time passes it does get worse telling the mafia story now where like even Through My Lens I'm like yeah so I saled these guys by just showing them my I mean it's such a look I was with these strangers you showed me your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I think this is healthy to look back as 30-year-old men that's 29 in the chat 29 27 you're 30 31 34 and that's beautiful looking back and we we go you know what kind of problematic things we do you know maybe dude 10 years ago now no about eight years ago and when Ludwick showed me his nasty butthole why you his brown stained skin pre oh pre Bay pre Bay can you imagine Aiden I wake up during the mafia game I look at like Ludwig's nasty butt droing it's not droing you don't have to get so graphic with we get it but but that's what it was yeah okay okay all right so do we just want to shy away from I don't want to limit your feelings about it it just feels like maybe you're adding some so his drooling [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is in front of me it's like 4 in from my face my nose that close it was so close it was that close it was that it was dude it was in and I was there and Aiden was there and so was his dad God I can't believe you did it in front of cor I wouldn't feel bad about that I do that pilot school I would do that today that part that part of sim training when you're in the Triple 7 Landing a pona and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] oh my God there's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] there's somebody's drooling [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you got to be prepared for anything as a pilot so and you know and I and look at it I did not think oh no you know I don't want this who I'm sorry are you coming on to me I thought this is the beginning of something beautiful and possibly romantic in the next year or so yeah it worked it worked but what people don't tell you is that it only works if you have a beautiful butthole and if you have an ugly butthole it doesn't work I don't hey I got some bad news for you what you don't have a beautiful but hole my but hole is good you got an amazing butt but in but underneath wait between is it don't you have a hairless butthole he has pretty hairless you think you're like that guy from the YouTube video who showed it in four seconds you're not that guy sorry sweetie okay I'm not that guy's like the Kobe of that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] having a clean butt I'm saying of the but holes in the world I'm probably like D1 college level you are 30 years old you think it really has held up show us right now I'm not talking now I'm talking back then when it was snatched I'm not in my Prime Oh I thought you said being in your early 30s was the Prime your life physically yes I'm stronger than ever show us your butthole going to show you myle I'm not going to show get up there I'm not it doesn't matter if you're solic now we're doing something problematic get up there get up there now fine in the work fine but I don't know if I do this I need you guys to be super freaking honest about how it looks okay you freaking cuz I swear to God if you try to hurt me when I come back down this year so here's what I'm going to do I'm going to stand up there I'll show you my but hole for the first time in eight years it's been a long time if I don't want to hear a word I don't want to hear any laughs at all and then I'm going to come back into this chair okay and if you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] laugh I swear to God I'm walking off okay okay okay Aiden this one's on you bro I know I'm digging deep don't look away yeah it's okay he tied his waistband [Music] really no no no please please don't want to see it please no I didn't think I didn't think you take your pants off so quickly you couldn't even get past seeing the batt for context for cont also do you not have underwear on what can you just ask the question you're say say they where was underwear we didn't even get L dropped his pants slime saw the back of Ludwig's balls and just bursts out laughing you couldn't even hold he didn't even spread oh my God you couldn't hold well hey you know what I I asked for so little from you genuinely what was the last thing I asked you to do come to my Super Bowl party is that why I'm being punished I'm sorry dude it wasn't it wasn't okay you know what you should be happy that I didn't see your butthole you didn't even open it oh I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm like relieved cuz I couldn't imagine the rockus that would have occurred if I showed you bro it'd be like freaking Rush Hour 4 came out early laughing my laughing your butt off butt off I'm I don't know what to tell you man it's fine it's fine man you took it you I think you did it on purpose you took your pants off so cartoon okay so I should have taken it off slow and sexily that would have saved you if I took it off slow and Slinky you know what it was there was like no shame there was no like like sh you didn't hesitate it funny we had a deal and I kept in my of the bargain no joke I think that you if you had done it sexily I think he might have been more entranced and less like yeah trying to turn you on I don't want to be turned on I just need to focus on something I I respectfully the ball was in our court and we had and we didn't up you know what i t a big game I was like it's on you Aiden and I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] did you laugh no no I'm proud of you honestly my face contorted I I think Aiden's seen me naked more than you these days yeah Weis Spa almost certainly that's right it's not comical at Weis spa though no do you still ham it up a little bit at Weis Spa what do you mean hams it up a little I would think so yeah I don't ham what are you talking about you H it up ham what up don't say ham what up I genuinely need to know what I'm Hamming up okay to be to be fair you'll go into public places and be loud and and rockus you you'll be a little Annoying now just multiply that by being naked with a bunch of men what why would that so okay so that's Hamming it up you ham it up the way you ham it up an airport you ham it up a Weis spot maybe other people are dampened he kind of okay here's how it works at wipa is there you walk into the bath area and at the entrance there's these little there's small towels that you can take with you that are nice to have for a variety of reasons a lot of people at Wiis Spa I would say maybe half walk around with the towel they'll hold it in front of their dick when they walk around ooh like a soft like etiquette yeah tow is so small it's more it's more like shame and embarrassment and they're using this bite-sized towel to cover their bite-sized pee pee it is weird like I imagine the hand position to like have to pull hold it in front of your dick and balls so seems kind of awward people it is like that it's a it's very loin clothes and a lot of people do that but some people don't and guess which one lwig is what do you do with it do you hold it in your hand you sp my shoulder like it's a big long towel or you or you do the Japanese the Japanese weight where you put it on your on your head while the T yeah uh and but and then he'll make little comments sometimes he's be like you look at my dick like he'll do stuff like that he hams it up I'm asking questions I'm asking questions cuz I feel like sometimes I see Aiden's eyes darting okay let me ask you this if he looks at your dick do you think it's necessary to ask him if he's doing that I think I should know as the owner of my own dick Aiden the only thing I no I didn't I I'm so I am so forgetful so forgetful of Ludwig's penis that when we had the discussion whoa whoa whoa whoa don't do that that's a don't do that so forgettable don't know it was on this show wasn't it didn't we ask like we had like this question on the show or like around recording where when's the last time you like saw each other naked or something and my genuine answer to the question was I don't think I've ever seen lwood naked because of how little that Wi Spa registered wow how little what a choice of words I feel like I like to take shots at lwig a lot like a a comple you think I'm talking about how small your penis is yes Robert [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] frost yeah I think you're alluding to something things subconscious illustration I genuinely hope you fall down the stairs and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] die from a an Ax Murderer converted in a wood fought its way into my into the underlying meaning by the way I figured out the answer to what to the age-old question is Yingling a worse online gamer or is Aiden a worse online gamer do you mean worse in terms of like Vibes and like vitrio and acid that's obviously Aiden I mean by the letter of the law oh okay and if I were to say I want to break your legs with a baseball bat oh that's illegal that's a crime oh because I'm saying what I want to do who I want to do it to and how I'm going to do it okay and if I said I want Aiden to kill himself or I want Aiden to die it's more like Wishing Upon a Star or if I said I want to kill Aiden really that would be fun really that would be fun which is surprising you guys looked into this I looked into this I looked into this wow and so I know as a fact I could I could say I love my friends so by no you can't I love my friends you okay say that how about we don't I also love my friends but I I don't say it I can't say I love to spread love and kindness to everyone around me I can't say that you can't say that I can't it would take a lot of work lot of censoring to do Argie Archie can send us to jail he can send us to actual jail years he could have though yeah and that's why he's a good man mhm yeah okay so so that was the deciding factor so who who who did the wrong thing here it Wasing Nick Yingling said I'm gonna break your legs with a baseball bat I think something to that effect he said I he told a person on inv valer that uh I am going to break your he said I am going to find you and break your arms yeah well wait did he say how if he doesn't say how no he's fine then okay how about this I I wish I could break your legs with a baseball bat I think I think the wish saves you wish saves you language is so beautiful yeah um and we need to remember that yeah I think it's important to to exercise it to its full ability you know what I thought you were going to bring up huh is uh yesterday while the Super Bowl was on I was I was doing some stuff at my desk and you thought I was like playing playing Mario car I wasn't I was just trying to do something like on my computer Kong was just on the screen he was driving make fun of me for choosing to be at my at my desk for for be while everybody was at the Super Bowl party for a while coconut M was just on the screen well to be fair I was judging you immensely I was judging you you know what I real piercing eyes this is this is what happens you slime if I go it's just me if I'm just like trapped in the idea of something it's very hard for me to uh and I haven't taken my ADHD medication in like a week I just get sucked into stuff and I worked on a little project yesterday there's something you can do on a Wii you can edit Miis on your computer to put special characters in their names that you can't load on like a normal Wii and what you can do is you can put like hex codes in mi names that load in certain games when you display the me okay so in Mario Kart there's certain images and hex codes that will load just in that game so like just to be clear during the Super Bowl party during the first half of the Super Bowl during the only half I've already been working on this for a while and I could get it to work like a there was a deadline like a deadline no but that's the thing it's just like I'm trapped in the whirlpool of like I want to solve this problem and uh I'm I'm not on my medication and I just get I get wrapped up in what I want to do you know what it's interesting that you're not on your medication so therefore you focus harder no I think it's like your attention is grabbed by like dumb things okay and P and you're pulled away from and all your friends are there and they're talking about something else and you're not talking to them and he's locked hex codes well I want to see the final much like Nick trying to get his Modern Warfare 2 the right shade of blue this was like that project where I've done this a long time ago in my childhood and I'm figuring out all these errors with like how you import these custom mies into your week because you're like troubleshooting you have to like SD card in your PC try new stuff SD card in the Wii see if it Imports you're going back and forth these special hex codes load images from Mario Kart in the names and I spent a collective not all yesterday but a collective four hours figuring this out zipper could you pull up the image on the screen this is my final creation this is going to be like a Picasso for me to enjoy it I mean when you toil over something for so long I was dead set and I was so I was so proud when I had completed it I sent it to you on Discord because it just and and weirdly enough I've never in my in my decade plus of playing Mario Kart Wii I've never seen someone do this okay that's that's that took you four hours what part of that to is it the calculator font absolutely the calculator font so that's great so a audio listeners real quick what he spent four hours doing during the Super Bowl we had no I was doing the first half of the Super Bowl so for an hour and a half during the Super Bowl where we're all hanging out we have a group of 15 he managed to get his name and Mario Kart to be boobs but how you would write it on a calculator so 80085 yes yeah because that's a special font in the game that you can get to load in your main name right and and you're 30 and I'm and you're I'm 30 years old hard 30 I know I'm close the guy normal the guy is is there any other modifications going on here no I mean this no no is enough no is enough to say CU that was a yes or here's what you should be doing if you got four hours work on Grumble Volcano you know give give that one an extra look dude give it an extra looky my Grumble my Grumble Volcano time's pretty good pretty good pretty good sounds really good yeah I'm sure your teammates love a pretty good Aid Aiden's day gets so much worse when he plays uh Moi dude he gets so mad well he gets worse sad at himself it only gets worse I'm so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bad dude I'm so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] trash [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that dude it's crazy but then after he'll like he'll like he'll like like review in his head like he's replaying the tapes I should I should have just got the shock and then taken the jump and then but I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] didn't and it just sucks it just sucks and I'm on this team with this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] trog and he's play Fat I okay he haded on that part but yeah you do say that honestly guy at the basketball probably fat that was maybe one to one with something I've said the last week yeah you get sad when you play Moi uh it's cuz it cuts so deep it's like losing in poker no it's not it is no it's not Mario Kart Wii is not like losing in poker cuz one the Mario Kart Wii Community is so small you know everyone you're beating and everyone you're losing to two poker you lose money that's the big one money time that's the money time you have Aces and Kings beats you cuz if one comes on the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] river is that the same I believe that's why okay think about this this is this is my support because I finally there's finally a real a real gamer I would say that that plays Moi it's Z Zin much like how he played uh uh melee growing up like watched Mario Kart Wii videos and like played [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] around with he's lowke keep coming for you uh he was up until this week he was higher MMR than me I think he's taking every game isn't that insane not it's this exact talking about that's the thing he's a gamer he he is he's like the best I I don't think it's coincidence I think what he's doing is finding every game you're interested in playing it getting better than you and's not better than me at melee just haunting your life he hit plat one I don't know dead ass is that can go into Genesis no dude dead ass well he's got he's got stuff to do yeah he still is competing he's the best American valerant player uh yeah and he plays he got into Moi like last year and uh he was terrible at the beginning but he improved so quickly yeah that's part of and I had been talking to him recently for the first time in a while about the game and he said nothing makes me feel like this game really nothing nothing else feels this bad that's why the game is addicting is cuz the high highs and the low lows are so far apart well cuz presumably every situation where you get oh I can't believe this shock hit me right before the ramp yeah is that what you sound like is that what it is little bit like that sometimes you you get the shock and you hit someone right before the ramp right like you're winning the 370 flips it's not it's not quite I think the thing is because it's like a game that is structured in a freefor all style like you you know how like when you sit at the table in poker and who you sit next to like who's to your right and left it does matter yeah a lot and I think in this game it's very similar in that there's no you're all playing against each other and there's a lot of Randomness and people aren't necessarily making good decisions and so even if you make a good decision you can be punished by other people choosing to make bad decisions for themselves and that's what makes the game so frustrating I understand you're explaining maybe like a high level Mario Kart phenomenon that's what it's like but what you are explaining is also what happens at like a a barade when people are playing Mario when everyone's playing on the N64 there's L there's less on the line and and then they're going why' you throw your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Red Shell at me dude dud a would be a terrorist at a Barcade Mario if he lost if he lost he would he would get kicked out of that sh 100% God 100 he would and and then he he'd be like that's fine cuz your your bugs are sticky anyway okay I I have it I have something maybe to support what you're saying and and a little against because the closest that has ever come to this because if I'm ever playing in that environment I'm never playing it's like it's never Mario Kart Wii it's always like some party game right yeah sure okay and and I'm not it's it and the problem with Mario Kart Wii is like it's hard to like layer out the parts in my mind because I've played it competitively so for so long this isn't like a it's it's not a party game to me in the same way that people play Smash for fun right elen of time is different for zfg and it's hard to go back to the old way but when I'm playing like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Mario C at Deluxe and you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] chugging beers and I lose to you it's like yeah whatever put down but in your head you're like I would [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] slay you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] at fate 3 in the UK at ponon there was a Mario Kart free-for-all tournament and there was like a hundred people who entered and most people just entered for fun because they thought it would be fun right of all the people there there were only five of the people that entered were like real competitive players in including myself and I knew the other guys who entered it was weird meeting them in person cuz I only knew them by like screen name and I've never seen them before um are you boobs yeah no that's me so it took me four hours it was when all my friends were hanging out dude nice to meet you and I and in the first round there's a race on like a shitty track that goes really bad for me because one of the noob players in the back like does something that is just so in a competitive context so idiotic it is would and I get mad I was like why would you just use it there and I said it out loud and then I realize it's like these people don't Plum they're just having fun they're not they're plumbers on their off the clock and it it was like the two wolves in your Wilt Chamberlain and you're and you're be like oh now I don't get my 100 point game I only get 90 was it like that it was a little bit like that dude you're nasty you're a nastyy I nasty gell I don't know sometimes you're a nasty I want to do another buo kard event on Mario Kart Wii but I don't know if you can compete wait why not cuz you're too good [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up me invite me and Zin but we have to chug two beers for will die Z will die's 100b he's soaking wet yeah he's a five foot can he well then I'll never worry about oh he might not be a he might how old is z he is 21 now right 20 then he has to smoke one full cigarette for every lap yeah and and scratch it scratch four lotos i' I've thought about this before because I've been waiting for the day and I think if you make me do two beers no way he's that young I he so you got to stop getting 19-year-olds to drink Aiden right so when I asked you to compete you didn't have to bring up a 18y you want that's why you want to go to damn UK that's why you want to go to damn UK Z go to the UK with me go to the UK you can get drunk dude and Diesel dereck's there never ages diesel dereck's birthday was actually his birthday party was last week and I went to it and I'm saying this as I'm on atrio stream and he's become like a he's become a meme in all these places cuz he edits for atrio now oh diesel Derek edits diesel D edits for you love to see a young 19-year-old get some damn work he and cuz he he yearns for that even if you said he was 19 he just had a birthday party he's a he's 20 in the lore at the very least roll back over they R odometer broken he's like Peter Pan he's slowly going back and then I've not that's what I've noticed is that the community atrio his age keeps dropping it doesn't matter that I'm going to birthday it's like none I literally went to Derrick's 29th birthday oh my God who cares if I put a th000 candles on my birthday am I a thousand years old is he a thousand but he has the mind of a 29y old and a mind of I have the body of a 15-year-old but I'm a thousand years old a

that I don't like that girl scout that was bad for the culture yeah the culture like us they not like us Girl Scouts not like us you can't you can't they they includes Girl Scouts they not like us you also can't get mad at him for spouting they not like us because that's all you did last night you got drunk and the literally literally the entire night this is cuz they hung out for hours after the game was over and he was like he would just go they not like us and he did it for hours that's that's the spirit of your friend slime cuz I would have been doing that same [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with you to me just a car anyway [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you what what about the girls got cookies Is it child labor 100% yes I mean it's it's teaching kids about like marketing and selling [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that they don't like see a profit in right it's like the typ I don't know did you have the what did you do in like middle school or Elementary School where like you'd have to sell something and you could like H very weird that in middle school I was being pushed by a company to go door to door to sell magaz was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but I think that wasn't as bad cuz it was optional right and like you could win a prize I think it's bad the Girl Scouts are forced in these camps I I I think about my like CH I I remember very specifically in Middle School looking at one of the prizes and it was that you could go in one of those like float around money booths for like 10 minutes or something and be like remember cuz I really wanted I really wanted money to like buy like a video game or this is C I think we had the same thing and you're on the west coast and I'm on the East Coast so this company been on a collision course they got children worldwide Nationwide zra can you look up the spellathon and see if it's still around spellathon 1998 Bellon yeah this is what I did so the spell it's called a spelling B no no no no spellathon no no no no no it's spell uh how are you going to convince us a spellathon is not a spelling be I I promise you no no no no no it's a I can explain it was not a spellathon it was this big spelling test and you went door too for people to buy like stock into you to perform on the test so if you like Ace the test you could get paid by the word or you could get paid by the test or something like that and was it for charity uh I no no it wasn't I it was so weird this kind of this it's kind of like those they would do those charity runs sometimes where you would like get people to commit to like they'd pay you five bucks for every lap you ran or something so it was that but it was this big spelling test and I was the goat at spelling bro I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] spelling up and so but the thing is the top price top of the bill it was like $200 worth of sales and that's in 1998 money which is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy maybe 99 yeah it was 99 and and it was you do the old person thing I'm really old and and it was a Game Boy Color [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] whoa yes and the other thing up top was like some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] toy and here's this might be insight into my mind everyone was getting the Game Boy Color I loved video games I thought it was awesome but because everyone wanted a Game Boy Color I picked the other thing cuz I sold the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I like got the 200 easily but I picked the other thing and it was like a dog [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] toy that I never played with and forgot about because only because everyone else end with you being smart no everyone else was doing the one thing you could have just had the Game Boy could just had game like till Christmas like a year later that's insane insane insane and I also can't the least believable thing is you can spell that well I can spell amazing a c q u i e s e yeah got it can you pull it up acq u i e aqu AC CQ u i e e yeah zipper no oh there's a c in therec that's tough dude you know what theid [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up the kids are

while why the Eagles just won okay yeah yeah he's he's over Moon he's sh for it one of the worst Super Bowls of all time I didn't watch it can you guys explain it shortly to me I know they not like us you so did you watch the Broncos Seahawk Super Bowl oh my God shut up when was that this was the 48 so Super Bowl 48 so maybe 2017 18 maybe oh my go I do like the bronies yeah well it it was it was like that it was just like they were losing like the the Eagles scored was that with Eli Manning uh that was with pton Manning pton Manning I forget they're both bald [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they're both not bald but one has famously as hair zipper can you look up pton Manning Peyton Manning I will give you picture but he does technically have hair on his head but he's like you know he's like I would love to see it yeah it looks like Aiden I wasn't going to say it man I'm trying to be nice cuz I think we're being too mean to Aiden's hairline and I think he's getting actually insecure that's fine what do you mean that's fine I there is no further things to add off that I guess I'm just a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dumb I'm just a dumb [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a dumbal just a dumb [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] idiot who who got who got mad on the podcast last week and my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] friends dude Aid oh man you're so bald dude what how is that your respon once wait you're going to say something the Super Bowl okay the Super Bowl was it was a wash it was a blowout it was like I I I don't know the final score but they scored what I think they scored 24 points or 27 points unanswered it was 270 for the Eagles that's tough and the bigest wait that was the final score no no no no that was the first half that was the first my God yeah and then and then the second half started and they not like us they like us and then they not like us cuz they really aren't they and they didn't let him say pedophile what did they say what did he certified lover boy certified okay that's fine Crow did it because the crowd can say it and then they went a miner and then everyone dude Drake's gonna blow his brains out that is crazy and then but anyway the the Super Bowl's a watch the craziest part of the Super Bowl is not the game itself it's that during the Super Bowl an ad pops up and it's Kanye West lying down on a dentist's bench and he's got new grill in New Teeth yeah and he goes and he goes so I paid for another Super Bowl ad and then he pauses for 30 seconds which obviously if you know anything about the Super Bowl it's famous how much it costs for 30 seconds of an millions and millions ofll he just doesn't say anything for like 30 seconds that's crazy and then he's like go to yeezy.com now if you go to yeezy.com Z I don't know if you can still pull this up dude go to yeezy.com real quick let's just take a look see let's just take a peek it oh at what he's advertising no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] way what that's crazy what he was advertising is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy if you if you didn't know about this this is It's just just a t-shirt with a swasa on it it's just a t-shirt with a swas on it and it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and it's really small on the website but that's irrelevant it's just can you click on the shirt how much does it cost that's the landing page yeah this is the landing page how does you click on the shirt well if it's expensive Aiden might buy it no okay the like size one two three I wonder to car I have a question or a $20 don't don't don't say the swasa shirt is a great deal I should I yeah I know I did say it in a tone you said a tone like a bargain right like yeah cuz like you wouldn't get a sh for 200 but 20 that's a lot of money you said it in that way which is an is bad is bad if it's free you still don't get the sh this it's a free I mean it's of course this might sound this might sound dumb but I and it is dumb I I I this ad played yesterday and I was on my phone and I was like what does Yeezy sell because I know the shoes exist but I only ever see like the old popular run of those shoes and I feel like I've never seen anything else I'm like I don't even know what this is anymore so I go to yeezy.com and I see the wasn't like that when the ad rolled really it it was you know how it was a tiny it was a grid of like all the normal normal clothes they sell my God I'm I feel like it's insane that they didn't cancel his ad with what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he's already been saying dude he's just been tweeting like blatantly oh wait is he gone dude did he get kicked no no it's it's I think has a different account no that's his account I thought it was like Yay that's his name I think yay they they um they finally done with his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he's been saying insane [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he was also like posting hell like porn talking the Jew he's just been talking about it's just an insane he's just blatantly a Nazi plus pornography that's what wait how how about this I I I wish that he he would get beaten with a bat and that is that that's fine that's totally fine say that is this account still up uh no I just looked on my phone as well delete it's G that's probably good is it good because we're getting rid of freaking Free Speech we're getting freaking speech it's supposed to be the freaking Town Market can't even have a cool ad where a guy says his website and then it goes to a swas t-shirt anymore oh my God it is crazy this also happened during the Super Bowl that's crazy is uh I did not not I enjoy watching the Super Bowl I like the I like spectacle of sports I loved the Super Bowl last year the game was super exciting and I didn't who won I just thought it was exciting this year don't care who wins and L's like anybody want to place a bet I'll take either team and I was like I'll take either team but let's do a bet for fun I bet I get the Eagles straight bet no spread he gets the chief straight up just 100 150 bucks and they're getting destroyed so lwig is like getting prepared to send the 150 and we're in like the third quarter and the the Chiefs are on offense and they still have zero points and the third quarter he's trying to he's trying to make more bets to get his money back so he's like come on come on come on do you think they'll score on this drive do you think they'll score on this drive and I was like yeah I do think they'll score on this drive okay okay I'll bet on the other side of that I'll bet on the other side you just want action you're mean the the Chiefs the Chiefs have like 50 60 yards to make up and to to get a touchdown and I I'm betting on them scoring on not not this play the whole drive forward we shake hands and literally 2 seconds later Patrick Mahomes gets the ball and dunks a long pass and they score and I instantly get another 50 and he was he just kept doing this with other people and kept losing so the I I was okay look first off I thought the chiefs were going to win okay I thought I thought I was like I feel like you were if you didn't think the Chiefs would win then you would be in trouble with the wife no that's so why am I crazy for saying that you're crazy why am I crazy cuz she doesn't know three players on the Chiefs she knows one yeah and he's horrible sure surely she wait he's horrible I thought he was like one of the best players on the I'm sorry is someone going to the Super Bowl horrible at a game Travis Kelce has not performed as well as he historically has you said horrible yeah he play he got one catch for eight yards that's pretty [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] horrible it's cuz she doesn't give him enough time she just can't Taylor's not giv he can't get in the gym anymore yeah cuz he's too busy singing along to reputation yeah in the car yeah and it cuz it's so good though I mean no I thought they were going to win because I thought it was rigged and I thought the Chiefs 3E and and Taylor Swift Nation needed this can I and it turns out no they weren't okay and I did make a bad damn bet to Aiden I lost my damn bet this is I'm not an NFL Watcher Chief [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Wiggum Patrick Mahomes fat ass throwing that ball I have a Quin sorry Patrick I'm sorry that was that's what's wrong with you you you've become a monster was too much that was too much show us your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to make up yeah I won't laugh this time you're going to laugh again I I promise I I'll give you at the end of the Pod I'll try it again okay I have a I have a question I keep hearing the the rigged allegations for the NFL from everybody I hear it way more than it ever used to come up and I feel like like why why because they don't have to rig it for people to watch why do people insist that it's riged I think we collectively as an Amer I'll answer not a football fan I think the easy answer is we as Americans and like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] can idiots have an appetite for conspiracy especially now especially though it makes it a lot easier to be like oh something's something is out of my depth of understanding that is rigged I think it's just because the same teams keep winning too well I think that's normal right I think if you're a good team you might say a good te yeah but can't they just be good I don't understand what do you mean the teams can just be good like the losing teams no the winning teams can just be good conspiracy like for example the Patriots went to nine Super Bowls in 13 15 years maybe well that's cuz it was Stellar leadership and now the Chiefs have gone to I think four Super Bowls in in like seven years so you're seeing a lot of the same teams yeah and so then when those teams win nail biters especially when win because of a ref's call people are it's like ah yeah that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's rigged okay I think people also have been saying these [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] refs for like the beginning of time since refs existed that uh but yeah it's funny football is like all the money is dispersed evenly among the team so it really is who's the better strategist and who gets better like athletes is football like basketball where Superstars get calls is it like that cuz in basketball it's like a measurable thing like Superstar yeah it's just by like quarterbacks get more calls like they're really lenient on like roughing the passer so if you just hit a quarterback after they've thrown the ball they they give him no one knows that Brady got glass bones I don't understand you want to see can you look up Tom Brady now plastic surgery dude he looks bad he looks great I thought he looks good doesn't he he looks snash and hot I don't know what he maybe there's something different here maybe in a few years guy who got Botox guy who is literally a handsome guy for a living it's gone look at look that second picture look at that second picture dude no no go this this one I don't think he looks good pulled it side by side I think the B fat fat removal is kind of cringe I all I'm saying is I saw that picture of him is BU fat the the cheek one that's the Anya Taylor D he looks [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] phenomenal uh am I crazy he okay he looks he looks pretty good look maybe I just he looks like the Chad meme he looks like the Chad meme I don't know man he's the gigachad emote but a I think he need to do the cheek bag though the bule fat removal on his way to get look at this damn chipmunk look at this damn chipmunk in that photo two over you're telling me thatle fat removal yeah it's him on the left that's crazy yeah that's fine yeah they did snatch him up eh you know who also got work done sis uh Vladimir Putin can you look up Vladimir Putin 9s no no Vladimir Putin just he aged like wine he he just magically got rid of the gaunt holes beneath his eyes how long has he if he work if if our Russian leader works hard enough yeah he looks way different see wait what's the so what's can you look at Vladimir Putin plastic [Music] surgery is this a conspiracy theory that you I don't think it's a conspiracy theory I think it's pretty oh my God yeah I watched a lot of Putin documentaries a couple years ago and yeah he just Sis got work done it's okay maybe like we're all insecure look at his KGB photo he looks so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] look at his bald as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] look like Aid oh man he definitely looks the best at that photo he is he is losing it though I'm not I'm not going to look I'm not I a man I'm not going to look you here in the eye and tell you that Vladimir poent I lie you I think pu's kind of hot he's a little handsome [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that dictator take a couple take a couple years off him throw him in a we Spa maybe I'm hanging out with him maybe I'm hanging out maybe I'm hanging out with him there a conspiracy about his health maybe we're chopping it up there's a conspiracy about his health I say Vlad why'd you do it why' you why'd you do it and he's like I did it be for several geopolitical reasons and also natural resources and then I and then i' shake hands with him and I'm like you know what that checks out that checks out I don't agree I don't agree with it and that's why going back what 50 five episodes that you would be friend Hitler if he was nice to you you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] would if you met Hitler in you would [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] befriend him absolutely not well if we're in the spot no no don't give him that don't give him that it's different if you're Saw's tiny little meat and you go yeah you're an angry guy see his tiny little meat you're an angry guy you think yeah I watched uh instead of the super I fell asleep and then I watch Invincible cuz I want to watch something colorful and violent uh I watched like a whole first season it was fine was like a fine show first season's good it's fine I didn't watch season two I'm I'm in the middle of it f are saying it's fine it's fine I don't like that I don't like you doing this there's a show I like and you're calling it fine you're saying it's fine Al so when you like something and someone says it's bad you get mad I've been doing that this whole show and then people crucify me for fine it's better than fine it's oh you think it's good it's good huh season one is good sorry I was thinking about a a fish a joke about a shrimping [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hurtful you're being [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hurtful I'm not being hurtful I think it's fine queens of the St AG sucks that doesn't hurt me Final Fantasy cuz if you just listen to song for the dead you would like it Queen's the son AG is fine uh I think they're better than fine what do you like so much about Invincible bro to be honest I watched season one and cutie hated it so I never watched season 2 but I just like the scene where he's fighting his dad and then in the mountain and then they're in the train and they're killing a bunch of people and I like how it spins superheroes on its freaking head I guess I guess it's like cuz they're not all heroes dude like sometimes dude the heroes are the they're the bad guys sometimes they get cuz not everybody should have gotten compound V dude M dude there's a Caleb is putting me on this thing he's like yeah we started doing this on the road and it was like T trying to talk like Jeff Dunham like a ventriloquist it's like you like you tend to replace replace uh certain padel oh cuz you can't use your tongue you can't use your lits dud for 30 minutes just like being a v but he was you you end up taking on this like Tim and Eric Cadence of like sometimes I like to go to the house to the house and nit Ying is there and dude it's so it's so weird anyway if you want fun time with your friends just be Jeff Dunham at each other and Amed is in the room can you pull Amed the Dead Terrorist highlight oh my God highlight you know what I do remember like I I think as a kid I there were so many things that I like couldn't watch and like engage with in in media because my my parents didn't want me to watch them let's be real it was your mom uh say your parents but it was that beautiful woman stopping you it was honestly both of them really yeah yeah yeah absolutely what did they before you get into it what did they specifically stop you from like your mom didn't like you looking at violence your dad didn't like you look at it like men right is that like the mix it was more than that for both of them oh they're very I don't know they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with Amed they no they almost certainly didn't but I found this because of a friend that showed me it on YouTube like while I was visiting him or something and I think one common theme I had growing up was there was a lot of like vulgarity that because I didn't know it existed because I never interacted with it like I'm not watching things and then finding out about bad words and then my parents being like don't say that or like that's bad I'm like finding out about these words without knowing they're bad like the first example I can think of this is um in like kindergarten or first grade uh I got tricked into like point the middle finger up at another kid right and I didn't know that was bad and then I got in trouble and like the teacher didn't believe me which I've think I've told before but that theme carried on and he says a bunch of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] word you know bad words so what are you do you're walking into school and you're talking about like Iranians did you like produce like a skeleton of a terrorist I just thought I just thought bits I thought bits of this when I was a kid were so funny and I remember going to Camp or like going to visit like other friends and I would like recite lines from it and I would say like words about like I think I would say stuff like getting getting hammered or like bastard and I would just say them because I didn't know they were bad words or like douchebags I didn't know what that was I think this is a like this is normal yeah but it happened for me at like way later ages for me I learned bad words through people and it was known that it was a bad word when it was said okay he it sounds like he just washed I think what would happen a lot of the time is I would I would like confidently say something bad as something like funny that I thought was just chill to say in front of like an adult or like figure that wasn't really sure if it was okay to like reprimand me so they were like obviously uncomfortable and then I would awkwardly find out at an age where like they have the expectation that I already know that that's bad I think is happening I remember this happening in like fourth fifth and maybe even like sixth no probably like fourth and fifth grade like being like a 10-year-old like saying [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] because I just have never interacted with like these bad words my mom put the fear of God into me when I said a bad word yeah that's why I still don't like saying bad words in public CU she like she she made it you don't like words in public loud enough for someone to hear I don't do it and if you paid attention to my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] words and you'd [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] know that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] eer eer e eer I'm I'm going through the data eer and he might be right eer I didn't swear for the first 13 years of my life see that's cuz you're a good boy and that's why you have a good Mor I didn't want my mom to be mad at me or sad at me you in French uh I think I did that I did do that but that's cuz I didn't know what I was saying yeah what I'm saying I know not to my mother but that would be like my cousin being like say this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and i' be like okay dude I was trying to pull this up I was playing this mobile game cuz I was ranking all the mobile games it's called Uh last war it's like literally the game that's in the Instagram ads like the shooting one yeah and it's like the plus minus there's like a global chat I open it on stream it's just a bunch of people slinging the nword yeah that's also how like NBA live stream pirate streams are it's the same thing but the audience watching an NBA pirated live stream is disproportionately older compared to the last war player base you would think so no for sure I Absol there's there no argument here zipper pull up what I sent you I didn't send him any imagine I have I have Insight I was so shocked like do you have a paper I just predicted it like he talked about that bridge in your hometown going down uh dude Rush Hour 3 is pretty racist yeah I think all of them are it starts out and that's like the point of the and Jackie sees this guy who he clearly has a pass with and then because he's Chinese and then he calls him brother in Chinese okay and then the guy starts speaking back and I'm watching this and I'm like that guy's speaking Japanese no way 100% that guy is speaking Japanese but I wasn't like super sure and I'm but I'm like I'm pretty sure that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] because I've been studying and then he comes back up and then he's speaking Japanese again and Ja like it like yeah Jackie speaking back now I I'll I I don't know if Jackie is speaking Japanese because I don't what he's saying is not making as much sense to me but I'm picking up the other guy okay I'm like he's going Nano I'm like oh what right what okay I'm in this and then and then like 40 minutes in he's like yeah he's talking to cter he's like yeah that's my that's my that's my and he uses the word in Chinese for brother he's like it's my brother uh he was born in Japan when he was 70 went to China and we saved each other and they EXP explain it then but I still think Jackie talks in Mandarin to him and he talks back in Japanese and they understand each other like in Oceans 11 12 and 13 I feel like with no concerns at all I need to see that they did fix it though they yeah you can just look up uh they fixed it huh well like they the resulted in the story they resulted in the story by saying he's born in Japan I thought you me they like changed something retroactively or something uh no no they that's a good ear you're getting pretty good with that sex test teacher you got no no I I don't work with anymore right cuz the schedule filled up or something uh it's just too hard to do like I miss so many lessons I was paying for anyway it's like but I do my chat GPT now oh you were talking about that I talked to my chat GPT friend he's really good I asked him I seen how far I could push CH GPT so I was like oh how how do you say how do you

crazy for that I think and I love [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with that guy but you are driving him to an insane place he's driving himself to he did he order a burger at a Mexican place and this is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] final price I'm saying he's he's ordered this on himself with he's hurting himself with League okay that's irrelevant to to me that's true thank you what did he do he has played a gross amount of games so what too much it's too much though is Miles you're not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] making miles's life mil plays less than it's not as much it's not as miles plays way less than Shake measurable how much he has played I I actually don't think that's true it it is there's op.gg I don't know miles is whip up the op.gg shake drizzle we can find out Prince Untouchable regardless regardless so I don't invite shake and I and instead so it's Pokey it's myself it's trik and it's squeaks okay tck is Luffy squeaks is Karo is this coming up this is February 28th yeah okay there's still time to fix this well this is where the hurtful part comes in that's crazy who's the hot cuz I feel like it's been hurtful no one's the hot day cuz I'm over it I know I could guess who's the hot day he first off squeaks is hot he is hot as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but he's saving himself [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] squee is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bad as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sque squee is good looking uh trick is Luffy he needs to shave this part of his beard okay he needs to shave the whole beard actually but anyway anyway uh I'm talking to Pokey because we do like the sponsor stream yesterday for Takis yeah yeah and she's like ah I don't know if I can go anymore oh and I'm and I'm like what do you mean you don't know she's like well I'm going to France and I don't know how long I'm going to stay yet see play I'm like how when will you know and she's like the 24th and I'm like the 24th mhm 4 days before yeah I need to find somebody to fill and get them a cosplay so they can be a part of our group yeah in four days they have a team cosplay so I'm like that won't work so I need to do it now I need to like find a backup now sure so I go to shake drizzle and I go Shake would I explain the whole situation would you be a backup dude and he goes and he goes so you made me a backup I'm like yeah I'm sorry wait what was to replace I was going to say I think in my head this had to be the same character or costume so it was like I assume Pokey would go as like you know like Nami or Robin or something and then I'm picturing I'm picturing Shake is Nami or Robin I would love to see Shake is Nami I'm not going to hold you well this is where the hurtful part is cuz I was thinking of a good character for him and you we know how Shake drizzle works and uh and I I don't watch One Piece so I to me if you don't know shake drizzle looks vaguely dude you would say vaguely Middle Eastern possibly he's got like a beard like Eastern European I mean yeah he's from the Czech Republic he from the Czech but he looks he doesn't look white he is white sure yeah I mean but some might not ethnicity versus like RAC and so and so anyway he's got like a beard and and so I said Aiden can actually give you a guess you make that man be usop man no Blackbeard Blackbeard wait isn't that just cool well I thought it was cool cuz he's the main villain but then he pulls up pictures of Blackbeard if you can just go to Blackbeard images he was beside himself he was like dude I'm not that big dude he thought you were commenting on his body no I wasn't it's just that dude okay I will say I haven't seen Shake drizzle in I think two months I don't know what he looks like right now he looks the same but big like Blackbeard what he's fat no yeah massive like Blackbeard he's not he's huge like Blackbeard and he was hurt by this and he was hurt for some reason I don't know no he's not huge he's he looks basically the same he's he's just weaker yeah cuz he's not working out he's been working out yeah and so he's looking at Blackbeard and A Tear is rolling down his cheek he's like I'm not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Blackbeard yeah first off I cut him from the from the hot dat group and then and then now he's freaking so what did he say he's down Maji Shake need to grow a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] spine bro uh all right is this Prince Untouchable and after and after he left the party last night he played League of Legends until what time is at least he went wait until 4 a.m. God he played at 4 a.m. can you scroll up uh he has played 178 plus 178 games he has an exactly 50% win rate the system works he has an illness uh yeah that's that's 300 and 6 50 3 56 and he's still just playing car this you a prince Untouchable I think that's miles this 356 games that's a lot the season started I can tell you January 9th so that's a one month wow yeah so I don't know what the math is there but it's that's that's 11 games a day much that is so much that's 11 games a day average I I don't know that's play Sil yeah miles has 127 miles has a third of the games wow a third Shake is playing 11 games a day oh man I feel yeah he hasn't gotten out of the hole remember Nick's leag Arch which was also the same dude what a long hair pull it I got it yeah Nick Sark he quit yeah yeah he but what did he what did he peek at he got to bronze did he yeah bronze four it's crazy he didn't want to didn't want to finish iron he was so it was like all he did bad well for so long you would think a guy like Nick would be better at a game but I think crazy just a long system Nick to me is like a great gamer it is crazy it's crazy he was iron for that but he has so little I think you need to think about the games Nick has played I thought it made sense it's like he has he has never played a game that is like League he's never played a mooba like his frame of reference for starting in this game is so much different than both of he played like he has played so many PC games and he's just a gamer they're not similar yeah but I think I thought he just picked up [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fast I guess no I don't have any doubt in my mind that he would be able to get good if he like tried and like played long enough but I think the the his square one with that game versus others is like very different's you don't got to run D I'm that's why he needs D he's not here he needs it he needs guy with weak throat needs D yeah he needs my right now he couldn't handle it no he could he hand you know weak throat can't speak up for himself throat weak throat and you suck at League [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he's not going to listen to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all I'm defending him okay I'm standing no yeah I think it's I think he also wasn't focusing on like how to get better he like if he really cared about like getting really better like he would like learn all the Champs they do he would just he would just Doom q and play and ated on like CS yeah like Cs and Lux he thought that was his win con and I think League tricks you Mo is in general trick you into like if you win this miname and get your cookie you're actually improving which in reality the Improvement happens in many facets yeah that's why I was like you should play jungle are you still playing I I was I haven't played in like a week but yeah I I'll I'll run it I had a phenomenal win rate but I started hit a little W it's good to get over the hump on this one I I'm out I'm out but I realized my impact is last cuz I have not only taken Shake drizzle and and thrown him overboard like's you created you've turned him into a a hideous Beast of himself and that's why I can't you turn into Blackbeard did you turn him into Blackbeard knocked out his teeth I did cuz that was actually the first thing he goes he goes my teeth aren't that yellow oh for sh dude that's sad uh yeah I turned him into this piece because he was addicted to League fully quit and then my arc got him back on it is also infected so many more people cuz at you're getting reports at like like 1 in the morning fley is like yo trying to we need a fifth Rel League I'm like bro no that's tight it's 1 in the morning dude what's her rank it's unranked but she hit gold in season five yeah okay dude I would love to play with those guys yeah they're they're addicted and then not only did my my league impact start people playing League this iron Monon thing I'm doing people are doing it you you've got the you've got a little little impactful Swang it's not good it's not good yeah it's like I love the I love the trickle down it's like Kai does something and everyone copies Kai and then that trickles down and like into like lwig and the lwig does something it trickles Down K respectfully you're like the you're like the middle management of this whole system respectfully when when Kai is buried in a pyramid for the lasting impact he has had on America sure in a Bass Pro Shop pyramid that they make it his honor yeah yeah and they do and Phantom is like on a billboard yeah and he has successfully removed all Texs in terms of tariffs he's our President we will never have an op.gg with his name on it that hits plat oh my god well never you know you're such he can copy whatever he wants never it's never going to happen it'll never unless he buys an account it'll never happen it's like it's like there's a jock at high school and he's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all the cheerleaders and he's just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] awesome and you're going up to him like but you'll never be captain of the chess club ever it's like and he's looking at you and he's like he's like you're right you're right I won't I got to go by the way and and I'll say and I'll say thanks for admitting it I I'll be at the funeral in the pyramids I'm looking I'm not looking forward to it because I hope you live a long prosperous life but I'll be there he won't okay so copy that he can't right yeah you you know what technically correct the best kind of correct so yeah anyway the iron Manon is the next thing people are doing that I that I did and yeah people are doing all that they're like beating you and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] didn't meang beat your ass okay didn't she Sun your dumb ass she did not Sun me I feel like you got Sun she did not Sun me it's okay you got Sun me you said it in different words the okay she beat it slightly quicker but no but she had all of the footage of me playing to work off of and like to learn like I I was like I'm Marco Polo and you're like yeah but she ran through like you're saying with like with no Larry Bird there's no Michael Jordan that's what I'm saying it's like it's like yeah she figured out how to dunk quickly it's like I was the first one to do that yeah you were Dr J in the little shorts and the goggles thank you doing three three-point line hook shots yes and she's like oh I can improve on that yes and that's a way that you make yourself feel better about failing it's just true I I'm a ground path taker I'm a I'm I'm like uh dumpe dumpe yeah oh I walk the grounds the hollowed grounds and then [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and there's a 10% [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ass link walks that you're useful uh yeah but anyway that Ray's been playing it for like 15 hours there's a group chat I'm in like five of them are like yeah we're playing today on when you were streaming the other day were you like coaching different people on their runs what were comment a race yeah and it and I and I and I it was like to be the first gym leader and I did it in like an hour yeah and then that was the race and then I'm like I have to go I just got [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to do I have to go and so I leave and then I come back after like 10 hours and I'm here and I'm and I'm on and my PC sells everything open they're still there everyone like five people are still like Kuno beat it m young beat it but the other five it's are still playing and Reay is still not past the first gym leader and I and I'm like I'm like how many times you get past it she goes once in 14 hours she got past the gym leader once and she goes but I'm getting really unlucky and I'm like bro there's unlucky and then there's like you know what you should just study your hand uh charts and I don't think they know the type I don't think they know the I don't think they know what fire beats wait did steal from the last episode does steel not that's actually the future episode steel not super effective against Bug Steel's not super effective against bugs that I mean close not even in the game you if if a man broke into your house and he was going to shoot you in the head based on your Pokemon knowled You' be dead instantly are you thinking cuz like a steel Hammer would kill a bug yeah no man but is steel super Ste super a rock cuz it shaves it down ice cuz it shaves it down and fair that's dumb you're telling me the steel doesn't shave down the bug doesn't shave the bug for [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's just doesn't shave the but been poison though doesn't shave it even a little [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bit bro that's I mean that's that's liberal jotto so anyway I got to find my new arc my new you find the new thing to get to well my next thing's going to be promised week you know what you could do what did you say promise week oh promise I like promise week I have just been making promises and not keeping them I've just been lying to his Stream So for years like we raised a quarter M for charity during past 50 and I just I was like yeah cuz we did this I'm going to play these games shouldn't do it whoa shouldn't do it straight up you know what's fun about being a streamer you can just scam forever and it literally doesn't matter ever I spun a wheel it said go bald and I was like nah yeah you just said I'm going do that and you didn't and I didn't what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and people still watch your dumb ass yeah they do it's all it's all a joke it's all a joke so so well that's what promise week is promise week is my but what if you just break promise week it doesn't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it who cares no it doesn't matter that is sacriligious BET canot break it's like it's like when Josh had god mode May and he had 50 things he was going every [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] day and he did like four of them okay good enough good enough part of the good enough crew no you absolutely cannot break promise week if it pops up on that wheel I will do it does goald on the wheel yeah no way [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] goald will be on the wheel yeah 100% I want to put weight weights on it like dice on like the other side on oh to make sure comes to the bottom and the top you're bald you shaved your head too many times it's not even a big deal anymore I've never shaved a ball to the Bone I think he just hates it and that's what's fun lwig once said as a streamer never make a sub goal something you want to do anyway you should just do it so that's why you know when he's doing all this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to avoid being ball that he [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hates to do it I really don't want to do it and your girlfriend hates it which is also funny she has to suffer for no reason because if you're hubris two nights ago shroud ended his fragon he was doing this auction right I don't know if I told you this I know about the fragon do you know about that I saw this you don't have X I saw it on X you know about you know about the 18K no what did you do I got a bit scammed man scammed yeah we spent 18K hold on did we spend 18K on the guy that you spent 50k on that never did the thing with you yeah so so for context I bought an hour of shroud during a Maya charity stream four years ago long long time ago and it never happened and it never happened and it never happened although it kind of happened no not really no no cuz he showed up to lwi trick and played on our team that kind of counts that's crazy you are such a c that's what you're counting do count you are just does that not count it was over an hour you are just taking advantage of like a that not count embarrass me you're in the chair in the corner embarrass well either way I got another hour so you got another hour yes for 18K yes I got another hour oh good it's discounted from last time good you know what I think your relationship with shroud is better well okay it's better and he respects you a little bit more and we're definitely going to do this hour for sure he respects you at all I think he likes me actually I use the word respect I shouldn't use that word I think he likes you a little bit more there we go okay well regardless I didn't even mean to I got [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] did you do you mean oh I got bulling just spending 18K okay kind of what happened is I I did an initial bit as a joke I was like oh it be so funny so I bit I bit like 5K I bit 5K and I was like and everyone was like oh lwig is here and I was like and I was like and then and then this guy bids 10K and he goes oh how much to get an hour with shroud and lwig and I go 20K and shr's like yeah 20K sounds good and then and then sh's like ah but there's no way to check to see if he bid 20K cuz the way the bidding system works is if you put in like 100k it'll only bid 500 against the next highest person oh so you can't like just come over the top like crazy 500 is a cap of coming over the top so if you were winning with 10K you couldn't if you wanted put 15K in it would keep you at the lowest to save money so shroud's like yeah I guess somebody would have to bid 19,500 and then that would show that he bid the 20K and everyone's like yeah the guy bid the 20K you get scammed like crazy so then I put in 19,500 and Aiden he didn't bid the 20K dude of course he did of course there just has to be a different way to check there has to be 18K Which is less you're like a you know what you are you're you're a big ATM machine I'm I'm I'm loose come up to you and they just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] put in their card and they get anything back that they want that's cool I hope it's a good hour I hope we hang out with I hope in 2031 when it happens it's El no it's happening soon we already set the date wow really it's next week we're doing a One V one to see who's the better gamer we're doing a One V one I'm One V oneing shroud in what in what it's brov bro so he's going to probably pick like what CS [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] gist playing a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] board game CS yeah what else does he play I don't know what this what else is pubg One V one in CS yeah and then I get games I'm really good at League mashing that's it don't do that that's your PO melee don't do that yeah I can smash you should play dude you should play him in like ultimate no that'd be kind of hype I'll lose you you wouldn't lose I'm really bad at yeah but he like doesn't know [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it' be kind of even if you play him as jiggly puff you're just going to rest him and he's like what's that I have a goatee from jamest and then he Lo that's what's going to happen in CS so it might as well hurt him back uh sure I guess it is humiliating you do the darnest things anyway I'm bringing this up to say I need 18K cuz I had to use my personal dude you're such a pain in the no you know it's not my job anymore that is a pain in the ass though what nothing it's awesome you're awesome it's actually fine every is it surprisingly fine you've beaten him you've beaten and bruised him he's been an [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for like four weeks this is the best he's been be a different guy he got over it it took him a while I'm trying to loosen up he well cuz he's a hard ass and LG's right about everything BR you're like in Game of Thrones you cut off his penis oh I cut off a damn penis you cut off his penis like oh yes yes I'm not going to defend myself I'll you with a straight razor and I won't cut your throat I'm not going to argue not going to defend myself anymore I'm going to chill out he's chill have a nice time chill boy I'm going to break you into like he did except it's on this live show you can break me it's fine how about you know in in spirit of I like this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] if I take I should also give cuz we're to give anything towards the end of the Pod you've given me everything well I want to give you one more shot one more shot I'm going to stand up there get one more shot and I'm gonna pull down my pants and I'm going to spread my cheeks and I swear if you laugh I'm not showing up for the Primo I might not even show up next week hey do you guys understand do you understand the deal that you have made this is the this is the most high stakes y l y l I'm not showing up and I'm still getting paid I of course you get paid if now of course if you of course if you don't laugh and you just tell me what it looks like cuz I want to be honestly rated then I'll be here as normal okay uh both my parents are dead really sad um I'm a doctor and I'm doing a medical exam dude you know what some things change and some things stay the damn same that brown eye looks damn [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] identical I seen it last time I damn saw it in Pomona California damn son of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you go ahe have the week off I'm taking the week off actually it's so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up cuz they're so little hair mine is so hairy so what's the rank I told you it's a D1 college basketball player not even a little bit close what no okay you know what I'm not going to use language that might hurt your feelings I'm going to be very analytical about this lwi it's too Brown what do you mean it's too Brown what is this racism the brownness of your too Brown bring up your bad BL are you familiar with what a Corona the virus not the virus not the beer but what happened when like the sun makes like a circle right like an astrology thing yes sir I do now your butt pretend it's your butthole uh tight now around it what feels like a disproportional area around it is so Brown it's it's like it's spread instead of like a tight brown little and little shots jump out of it like solar flares there not little shots I'm just saying the brownness of your butthole has radiated past where I feel like it's appropriate sprad there were Sparks okay so what am I Varsity I'd say you're a wreck League butthole that's but you're like top of the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] not going to go I thought you were maybe division three division Le butthole but you're like those those graying like salt and pepper like awesome 40-year-olds that are like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] athletic as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they cheat on their wives I haven't seen I haven't seen an [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] spread in a long time but I thought it was pretty good bud he [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he hand it up he he got up there he took off his shirt so it was he did the little kid at the urle bit where you take off all your clothes to stand up and pee I thought I was going to make it I got I knew the real kicker is when I when I bent over I put my head between my legs so I would look at you so that you would see my face below my butt which is a weird place to see my face yeah it's like a very custom uh board State yeah yeah it's not common dude [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Nick gets go and we see your ass all yeah the World falls apart piece by piece Department of Education is gone and it's butthole town now with that's in m i uh I was going to say also uh I was trying to literally pretend I was a doctor like you're my patient you to get into character you know I was like oh well just a human body he's still cracked do you think do doctors probably chuckled a little no no they're all that be so hurtful no cuz it's lost the novelty they see butthole like before you have coffee if you run that for the 80th time it's just like come on man they've seen everything yeah yeah you do have to have a a refractory period a pretty long one also also if you ask doctors about like the most [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they've seen it's just so far away from it is so I remember asking Dr noodle slam what's the worst thing you've seen and it was just so horrific listenable it is just I mean I watch house so I get it the thing is guys and you can think about this as we go into the Primo which was actually shot before this so Nick is in there uh so if you miss Nick he's in the Primo which is kind of sweet but would you rather have a doctor that holds your hand while you die or ignores you while you get better think about that ponder that while you go walk your ass over to the Primo is the Primo where Nick has the worst [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] metaphor uh like what was he just the worst questions hypothetical no it's hypothetical that was last week I don't know if he came with more I think that was the Primo right where he just had the worst hypotheticals I think he is on a insane downward Trend it is a sell on Nick it's a buy on no it's a buy on Nick cuz he's lower than ever no cuz he's low and he's got weak throat but if you buy now you're you'll hit for strong it's like trumpcoin it's only going I think it's a sell on Nick some people think it's a bull market but you know but you know be your own person this is not Financial advice this is financial advice by Nick we'll see you in the Primo by slime he's going to the Moon oh my God you're a joke you're a joke he's got aell and a protein chocolate milk the protein shake protein shake did you run here you did not run you ran from your house oh why didn't you drive cuz my car you ran in your Mater shoes M with it's not wasn't your car you said you woke up at 10:28 a.m. dude don't even freaking start
