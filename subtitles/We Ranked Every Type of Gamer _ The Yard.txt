D and D comes out so go sub to the patreon because I don't look I don't want to leak but there's going to be some is that your real hand slime I can't see cuz there's going to be a lot of awesome new perks and I heard from a little birdie the bonus shows are getting a little bit of an upgrade so hey sorry Ludwig's not here for this one maybe he is maybe he is a certain point of the video um and and suck on it now I don't want to sh anyway the patreon it's going to have more content it already has a lot of content or chill in Nick zone or Aiden Zone l zone probably a graveyard I'm not going to lie it is but slime Zone they talk Swedish in his channel anyway no that's in spensa zone which is a separate Channel join the patreon and enjoy the [Music] episode I have Monster peep bumper sticker that's L Peep's older brother still alive still alive yeah yeah he's like a put the same drug but the same dose he's a lot bigger so he's just a bigger guy just burst over math he's a data scientist mhm and that's how he knew that it would be fine press one if you think Nick looks wet and like I think I was looking at the camera the two shot that boy looks wet you think I look you think you think I look wet I think you look like you look like you've been doused and don't ask the fans if they think he looks wet I know they'll get weird about it and I'm not looking forward to that you're dangling the hook for the weirdos and then when one of them bites you get mad it's like going fishing it's like chumming the waters and getting mad at the sharks they could the you're acting like it's in this inherent like gooner ideology to have to chase the blood you could you could just be normal sharks don't have a choice they have brains the size of my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sense and once it hits the nose you can't stop it I hate that I want to laot all gooners take the Goon Center out of their brain oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you got to pick your up died in [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Japan guys you got you got to get Red Bowl you got to drink it up you're an athlete help him help him drink one I'll help you oh God he Dr you love that flavor drop oh yeah lwi you need you need to get some wings lwi oh oh God you can't hold anymore okay there you go yeah I don't know where that weird prosthetic I'm sure you can drink as many of them as you want for years on end with no consequence lwig I'm sure I'm sure of it that was uh Jackie Chan's hand no yeah Jackie Chan Legend the whole uh jackiechan wax figurine that L had was thrown away except we kept the hand they saw it off yeah dude it feels crazy it's really gross it's like rubbery wouldn't feel awesome around your pants that's R that's what you grow if you drink Red Bull yeah it's true he can't say anything also that is a hat only love lwig is allowed to wear which is really funny it's a I think only lwig would be willing to wear hey hey no don't hey he's the athlete you can't put you're not an athlete you're not an athlete don't Aiden don't do you do it you okay you can do it but we instantly have to blur it when you do it she will be really mad it we just instantly blur it it'll look really funny do it do it do it do okay yeah Archie make sure there is no evidence of this happening okay well look y'all hey hey I know you saw that thumbnail I know what you're thinking I know oh they're they're dipping back into the well well dude if hive mind gets to do one every [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] every single other week and those guys are cool I don't think it's crazy for us to go back to R every music note honestly a is pretty lit I'm a I'm a but f f f is lowkey fire but F underrated F's underated I think put F in s tier and put a in B tier overrated cuz it's a standard tuning see this is like this is this is what you want this is your slop you the slop the real slop man is gone here's your real slop yeah I synthetic and gray uh when we when we talked about this idea I immediately thought like oh it's funny we do this when lewick leaves and my immediate justification for that is like he does tier lists all the time for his job it's nice for him to not have to do it yeah we want to do it we're saving him then I looked at the other episode we did every guy that's exactly what I said no way when the video starts and I was like time's a flat circle it's a flat circle and here and I'm back and I'm back and then we're back and we're back I like being back because we can we always cut crazy loose when he's gone he regulates us oh dude he holds us down and he [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] spits in our mouths Regulators it's gross he's like the government yeah he's like the government and now we're finally free and we could date anyone we want at any age we want can I just say that he sent both of you guys a message asking for a playlist for his trip this one hurt we don't need to talk about it this hurt him we don't need me yeah I just guys clearly also I'll read it out clearly a um a copy pasted message he said sent it to me yo would you perhaps be willing he would never talk to talk to you ever no no no he has perhaps would you perhaps be willing to make me a a Tilda 2hour music to listen to on my motorcycle trip smiley face it can be on Spotify and you just link it like I don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] know I'm biking for like 60 hours so I'm trying to get a few people to make me playlist I listen to each day another line break literally can be whatever songs you want on it Pepe dance what is it like squeaks getting messages like those all the time it must be nice must be nice that he feels the need to be sweet let me clarify guys did receive this message this time it might and it might be the longest message I've ever received from him Nick on god dude he I don't think he sent me more than two lines in a year it's actually crazy it's nice even though I know it's pasted it still felt special F that and that's why we're different cuz it didn't feel special for me but at least Aiden we got it I like I like how you got it and you're like it didn't feel special it's like and Nick didn't get it but it would have felt special would you have felt special if send you that copy pasted [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yes yeah wow yes I think if he was like hey do you want to make a playlist for me I'd be like he likes my music iow did like that but I didn't like that it was copy pasted it's copy pasted when you copy paste messages to people I always it's at least put something in there yeah put a little something bald LOL I used to do this with mango when I needed to paste messages to like all the invites to Summit or all the people in SoCal star league I'd paste it to everybody and then for mango because he made fun of how formal my message it was once I was hand typ Mango's message how how would it go like I up goat hey there like hey there cadorin I'll have you know the tournament will be February 10 and then mango be like yo tournament Feb 15 to 29 and then uh not spell out you there dude your code switching for mango that's so sick L did not send me a a message for a playl i dm' him I said bro you dm'd everyone but me for a playlist and he said well let me get a playlist I said I I'm just so hurt like imagine I wanted some recommendations for New Hampshire restaurants and I just checked Yelp which is like asking Aiden for music which he did and then and then he said honestly I was planning on asking you well I just didn't need it for the front part of the playlist A lot of people think that the back part is the most important as well and that's where your music would shine and I said you are too media trained you were massaging me into loving you and then he said also Alex's playlist was 20 hours long and I said you asked Alex yeah that's that's rough he just met him he made that the wrong Fork of the road there and then he said also bro you should hear what shroud listens to he's a school shooter he actually said this and then I said you asked Alex and shroud yeah that's and not me that's tough and then I said I am not kidding when you come home I will be buried under your yard seat and he said you're making this sound bad and I said for whatever Wi-Fi you are on in Japan and then it all caps ingredients for a bomb how to make a bomb uh and then he started sending me a bunch of apologies he said I don't deserve it but I'd love a two-hour playlist if you find it in your big freaking heart he said Fring I can hear him saying and then I'll send Archie I'll send you the face he sent me he sent me a picture of his face I guess I'm sorry so I did make him the playlist um and the playlist is entitled it's the picture he sent me and it says I listen to this playlist because I am a pedophile seriously not a joke also I have a bomb in this airport and it's two hours of honestly pretty good music I will say when I made mine for him I like slotted it in I was like okay I got to work on this thing and work on this thing and then like do y do lwi playlist and I really did think about it wow I did I was like what would he want to listen we truly covered all the angles here cuz I received the message thought it was special and didn't make the point that's insane that's the most insane cuz I came into the so this I came into the office and I I I announced to the guys I'm like like did you guys do jubin playlist and Aiden turns he's like no and then Nick is like playlist like what do you me I say no you did and all of like I'm like what leing playlist and they're all like oh that me look at each other like uhoh man but we we reverse engineered it if you're at the top of his DM stat cuz the the day before I sent Ludwick a Mark Wahlberg video yeah and I'm obviously up there uh so you going to stay at the top I had messaged him in a few days he's a popular guy I'm probably low on me coping probably low on the stack to be fair to L's Discord if you haven't messaged him in two days you might be 60 deep in the stack it's look there's a lot of people that he's sending [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] copypaste to anyway he's gone uh he's just a smoldering wreck some ja he gone today the the yard boys will play we will play now we're going to play with we'll play with it we're going to play with it with you Aiden do you think that will'll develop cataracts from looking at screens for so long oh my God dude shut up feel like my eyes are getting worse he might be gone but I will [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kill you I will [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kill you if I have to do it maybe we should just do the segment was the cookie episode without him too the cookies uh primo one where I almost beat the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of Aiden well the yeah that was without him we got some bangers bro yeah yeah oh dude you think there'd be a bag of cookies without him in the room full oh no Pap is taxing those immediately I would have broken your arm like a cop yeah it would have been it would have been [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up you killed me like a do shot you like a dog immediately anyway guys it's a tier list episode it's one that I think we would we picked it cuz we we have a lot to say I feel specially uh I feel uniquely suited to be the Arbiter of all things gamer I've been a gamer for a long damn time and I don't there's better people for gaming but Gamers gamer categorically who they are how they operate and why I dislike them or like them I feel uniquely suited to to answer here and so the every type of gamer ever tier list is brought to and just like last time we have some good categories for you guys uh in the top tier we have the gaming Legend uh next we have a net positive this is replacing our category uh kind of based M yeah after that we have harmless harmless is so high up that means that the bar is pretty low it's easy to be harmless right I think I think there's just yeah I think I think it's pretty easy to be a harmless gamer and that's a good thing so what that means is that to become less than harmless and to go to our next category ne ne net negative net negative you'll also notice there are more negative categories than positive ones that is because gaming creates more negative people it's true than positive people it's 100% we need more categories to separate those out so after the net negatives on society we have the whack playlist it's back everyone liked that one and then from there it's jail and from there it's death penalty yeah um because you know not everyone who goes to jail is killed Where will where will courage JD end up this time well do we wait do a veto we same rules last time uh no no no no no veto we all get our one time our one time you can utilize your one time to force someone into a category now man force him into a room and make it stink courage JD maybe yeah I got in trouble enough from the last [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] episode so's who's next dud don't make C I don't like that courage don't don't go into a room I want to get into another Twitter fight with a guy who goons on Main and has a moral Superior we're going make some gooners upset yeah we are going to make some goers upset so zip I think what I want you to do here is just drag a random one up don't go in order just drag a random one up we'll read it and then we'll start from there and this is a great one to start with oh no always [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] always mad this is the gamer that has that never improves is hard stuck in every title and and is equally mad about it as someone who actually practices do you can you guys can't think of anyone can't think of anyone who could be that I don't know this is this is one of the tough ones cuz like it's fun cuz it's like we have no points of reference thetical guy that doesn't really touch our lives really looking through my friend group I'm thinking who which one of them would it be would it be no not Mike Mike doesn't prove at games SK good at games so yeah you don't have to keep naming our friends and idea it but I do think that this type of person uhhuh deserves a break every once in a while oh oh a break cuz they seem to be always shaked and always mad yeah it is true there is no breaks on our there's no breaks for the other the other side and yours cuz you presumably are dealing with when you said hour you me the three of us the three of us and also Kirby lwig in the chair yeah well I'm going to have a little bit of a hot take here I think they're a net positive and the reason why I think that is because someone's got to be on the opposite end of the kill feed you know what I mean like when I get the 4K it's the guy who's always [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and always mad yes you know yeah I I think when you when you do frag this guy and he does get mad that's good for the game oh the whole our whole Discord is laughing and the clip is funnier and I think it's secretly a because if you can avoid this guy in your circle I think he's better in your game if if he was in your circle he'd probably be like have like he'd probably be really funny or like some sort of like other some quality that makes up for it like not just some but many probably you would you would think and hope I feel like this guy's kind of short on qualities usually no he's tall he T well compared to maybe like a boy like a child he's tall he's probably really tall your your take is what popped into my head at first cuz I was like well it sucks to have this guy on my team but then I thought it's great to be on the other team but it's a bit of a confirmation bias I would say because I don't think you need to be fragging against this guy it's like you also destroy the quiet guy who's not that good and just plays for fun too and I think this guy is a net negative because there are people who are equally bad but not uh a shitty person age that he's not harmless though he's a net he's either negative on the community he's the worst type of teammate to get and you do do not get I would say very much out of different out of being this person's opponent what yeah no okay I think you actually do get more out of this person being the opponent because what are the greatest moments in gaming bro it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Bobby Big Balls who is not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but when he was mad you're 30 [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that is like it's heart and soul if you're mad at the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] game that means you really at least have bring a human energy to something I don't think why don't we break through the froth wall here we're talking about you what the category it strikes a lot of resem talking to me me have an important he King with two characters I have important question because I think there's there's kind of two versions of this guy because to slime's credit when he's playing games with with random people right the maybe he is the always [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] always mad guy okay yeah I know keep podcasting white boy Sam for sure was what we call him I think you don't you don't let it go crazy at like your your teammates actually in the game with you and that's what makes the difference to me right because you're right I I think as an entertainment product I love this guy I actually think these guys are not often inters I think that they have I think that they talk about video games the same way a grinder does they just don't know how to commit those things the same way like literally not talking about you but I do know people who are like this who like they're they're always like yeah let's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] six stack let's watch the VOD and then they do all that and they just never get better and they're so mad and they're not necessarily angry or flaming their teammates they're just mad they're just pissed off imagine they could flame their teammates this actually changes a lot this changes a lot and I think I'm in Nick Camp I think this person is actually a net positive I think they're a net positive I would almost call them a gaming Legend but I feel like that's too big of a debate so we can would not call him a gaming Legend positive and that's fine it's fine and uh what an awful awful one to start off with the goat Evil all right the goat evil so I put this one in and the reason why it's in parenthesis evil is this is lein I was going to say this is the person who is the goat but so annoying about it like oh my God shut up but like goated like Everything You Touch so good at and that is pretty beast but we will later get to another type of Silent goat that is a different type of goat so what's another uh what's like what's another example not just lein I'm trying to think of like other ones that in other games an evil goat you could you could argue like maybe scumpy Chris G cuz he's like he was like a notorious [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] talker and like always starting [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but was like the Undisputed goat of Call of Duty m these dude these guys are good for the game or maybe uh like helmuth Bill the goat they're in that positive this is this FR I actually think they're gaming Legends I I mean okay so gaming Legend is it's more of a term of endearment to spiritual idea people that end up in this category in the future of this tier list may not be actual gaming Legends but I do think that if you're a goat and you're evil that is it it just automatically slots you into a Pantheon if we don't have a hel it's not that fun watching this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] get we oh you hate helmuth and you think he's terrible and you think he's an awful person dude but you just watched the two and a half hour watch the whole compilation of nanu pissing him off over and over again Tony G say on your bike and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a different guy oh my God and he's and he's freaking out he's like hey call me with 104 honey it's like yes we need these guys they're they're gaming Legends they're essential to the eem so bad today just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the lips dude yeah I I think an easy gaming Legend unanimous cuz we need them for the sport we need them for the the the the spectatorship of you need them for the the community of gaming it is it is an unfortunate byproduct of like it it beef in gaming will always have inherently more interest because we're just humans that way and uh when we get to the the other variant of goat I could talk more about okay so the other one um okay this is one of yours yeah guy who's never played Elden ring i' like to add before you talk about it neither me and Aiden have played Elden ring zipper has not played Elden ring what this is all true information now continue now I feel I feel fraking stupid I guess I guess I'm a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] chunk there's an important question that goes with this do you mean Gamers that haven't played Elden ring or is there a guy a character that has not played Elden ring that you are specifically talking the first one it's just yeah you're all just guy who has play Ring what is someone not having played so I feel like when someone hasn't played Elden ring to you it's like Aiden saying he like doesn't know what the TV show House is like it's some some sort of cultural Touchstone that they're missing that you think reflects on their value as a human being or as a gamer yeah yeah yeah explain it to me what is your value I mean it is it just means that you have either intentionally or unintentionally opted out of a of a of a piece of important media and you can sign that cuz like you guys don't play all the ring and because of it I don't respect you right so it's like I obviously don't and if you did play it then we could we could enjoy that beauty together you could be like oh I did that one boss and I'd be like that's a cool boss huh you like yeah and that's like the height of human emotion yeah yeah yeah that's and you're you're lacking that right and that's disgusting do you think that there's things other ways around like do you think there's things that you haven't done that that make you less valuable to us because they're equally as important in our eyes I've done everything you guys have done ever so it doesn't this is like a one of those awesome hypotheticals that doesn't make sense I'm going to give you a treat I'm going to give you a treat you ready for your treat put your hand out it's I'm going to give it to you the treat is you don't need your one time but you get to choose what category this goes in cuz I don't know how to I don't know how to I don't think I'm allowed how do you guys feel about Elden ring then um I think it's one of those thing it's it's Game of Thrones for video games it's like you have to go a period of time usually like a year or two where everyone talks about it and it's like everyone's like dude you got to play it it'll change your life it's the best and it's like what you haven't seen Game of Thrones like it's all the same behavior and then you know few years goes by and they make a new game and we all you know it goes down as a Legendary game you ever play it um maybe I don't play a lot of games the layers the layers of friction to consume this piece of media the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you talking about layers of friction you piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] slippy you play slippy on [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] melee that's not what I'm talking about imagine imagine if you told like like somebody like a random person you walked into in public like you haven't HD Grandmaster and slippy yet it's it's not it's not one to one but all I'm saying is like this the the media is I have to sit down and play through it for a hundred years how about this if you don't play elen if you haven't played elen ring you're just a Droid you guys are you guys are droids zipper's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] droid so we're harmless and that's that's my slime yeah do you think do you think that oo this a good question this is a good question do you think that of every person who's played Elden ring you would get along with most of them or or the lesser of that group definitely some vitriolic racists that I probably wouldn't get along with as been gold played Elden ring yeah so it's tough right cuz well that shifted me back over cuz I think that guy is awesome it's it basically it's like all right if you're a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Barista at Starbucks and you and I ask you have you played Elder ring he's like what's that you're a you're a Droid I think I think the rats under his bed have played elen ring I think these guys that have that have never played Elden ring uh should go to jail what oh I'm sorry do I not get my treat it is your treat my yummy yummy treat I feel like if you if you haven't played Elden ring you are harmless harmless come you know you can enjoy your treat enjoy your treat it is your treat it is your treat your treat you're right I also don't want this to be like cuz it's such a Reddit opinion now I'm like trying to be ultra contrarian to like find where I can be cool cuz cuz that's like a Reddit thing to say like oh yeah haven't played R you might as well go to jail and I don't want to be that guy either so I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] trapped you're because I'm a hater I'm trapped in a prison yes and I'm fine with that so that's fine um Rhythm gamer the Rhythm gamer um o cuz when I think Rhythm gamer there's there's kind of there's kind of two types there's like the lazy Rhythm gamer is like you play on the these guys or or you do the the the keyboard or you know or you're the the uh Dance Dance Revolution like those types of Rhythm Gamers well there's also like OSU OSU is Extreme bro I look what I was think for the sake of this for the sake of this I have put OSU players in their own category oh really interesting because I do think it's a type of person so this is we're going to we're going to exclude OSU players even though it's a rhythm game yeah okay honestly in my opinion harmless they're over in their Corner they they they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with each other every once in a while you see a cool clip from their Community I've never been pissed off by a rhythm gamer actually I have I did watch TFO do DDR once and I thought this would be a a pretty that would be an awesome use for like a single grenade so right there there's something that gets evoked there's nothing more fun I think than doing a rhythm game that you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] at with another person that is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and it's just like it's which just doesn't make you I don't know maybe that doesn't apply to the tier list itself yeah the gamer is outside of it I I think I I feel pretty confident that they're harmless because they're just over there and it's like cool yeah I respect what you guys do but also when I see like Rhythm games I'm I always feel like okay guitar here is a good example every time I see a guitar here clip I'm like I feel like a lot of Gamers could do this with time you think so I think you can put the hours in and like for the base game like you could you can expert all the songs and you can FC the songs anyone with time can just kind of do it not like the custom C maybe that's part of the harmless Joy yeah I think it's harmless Fair they can be hard I think I'm happy with that if you're this what I'm worried about it's like my experience with rhythm Gamers has also been suspiciously positive and I feel like I feel like when I think about the things that I associate with rhythm gaming I feel like I'm thinking about the imperson Rhythm Gamers I see at arcades and they play maybe maybe they're the active guys who play DDR like you said maybe they're the not like less active people that do like maybe one of the button ones and I'm I'm Balan but I feel like there's a dark Corridor in the back of the online Rhythm gaming that I don't know very much about and you're skeptical of that and and I'm they're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm going to put a little harmless stamp on this but I'm wary of the dark door in the back we're keeping eyes on you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] freaks fgc Globe Trotter fgc Globe Trotter this is one of slimes yeah this is basically the person if I'm correct this is the person that just plays like every fgc title yeah it's it's interesting I think it's someone who will just put uh enough hours into every fighting game to get like somewhat decent or or like at least understand a controller character now I brought this up and I was like should we put this in before we did this and Aiden had this immediate reaction which is why I wanted to put it in cuz like he doesn't like them and I I I don't know how I feel at a personal level I'm sure I like them fine but in in okay I've thought I've actually thought about this guy guy who has in his profile uh on Twitter it's like Guilty Gear Tekken Street Fighter melty blood [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dive kick play like plays Everything grow up pick one you know what my problem is with the fgc globe tro is I feel like they play so many titles because they think that's their opportunity for Glory they're like oh this is the title that I'll be top 100 in surely it's this one yes and I'm like this is put your nose to the grindstone this is exactly this is exactly it Nick this is the problem it's because they move from fgc title to fgc title because they are pretty good at fighting games Anthony they are pretty good and and then they pick they they and then the new one comes out a year later and they pretty good at the old one but they never had to push very far they never had to leave their comfort zone and then the new one comes out and they're better at fighting games than all the new people that are latching on to the new game so they get to be pretty good again and they get to reset that little cycle thep and over and over again and you never have to push yourself to trly good at one of the games they're playing games that have just come out so they're always a natural and I don't know a listener you might be thinking video games are for fun what's wrong withes fighting games are not for fun fighting games are not about having fun they're not they're not you need to pick a game you pick a game and learn stay in your lane it's like it's like getting excited for chess two and chess three and chess four because you could never be good at CH be that you were pretty good at chess one but you never got that good and you jump to chess two because because you could be kind of good at it at the beginning over and you repeat the cycle over and over and over pick one and lock in despite how critical we're being I do think that they're a net positive because I think they they're the only thing keeping Japanese fighting game companies alive I do I do think that uh maybe not particularly Japanese fighting games but I do think that fighting game community in general is has been struggling for basically almost its entire lifespan and I think that the the player Who's involved in multiple games the only reason we even really know about them is because they have a following of some level usually and I think that helps new games they play and I care about when a fighting game gets really big I could never play it and I do care I'm like oh that's cool okay a fighting game got big yeah yeah because I like that yeah because it feels good I I think Nick's probably right I think I have to look at the Grand scope outside of my own judgment and say that they are a net positive and I've met a lot of people who are very into fighting games the fighting game Community changed my life but I think I've always had this problem with gamers in other genres too this happens in any game that has subsequent releases in the same like series it happens with smash it happens with competitive Mario Kart it happens with all any franchise long title where I always think it is lame when people quit a game to play the new one because they just couldn't get good at the old one I think that is I think that's lame and I think learning how to stick it out and learn something and get good at that provided you actually enjoy it if you hate if you fundamentally hate the game I totally understand why you want to quit play new one but if you're the person who's done that over and over again with new titles it's like maybe you just don't maybe it's just not your thing hence hence the globe troter yeah and that's and I think that that's the kind of it's not the not necess the the learner who just likes the learning process and then stops it's the globe troter who does it for the ego and I think these guys [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is it bad if we keep putting the the guys who like have weird egos in that positive what does that say about gaming if we if we feel like we need them it's we need them I think we need them that's why they're in net positive is we need I I think it's actually more interesting that they're in net positive yeah you see the screenshot at the end and you're like how' they end up there that's exactly because it's true they're net positive always [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] always mad that guy makes me mad but I need him we need him all right all right oh the cheater the hacker or the cheater the cheater which I think are the same phenotype what can I say you uh I'm going to say jail on this I'm not going to say death penalty have you guys ever known someone who's cheated in a online game like like downloaded a cheat or a hack you mean like yeah you mean like well you do yeah can you say who it is we know them I I won't name them on the podcast you probably will that we can just bleep it it do you know no no he got back banned for Cheating in CS no and he got kicked from the homie server because of it the homie server morality kicked him but he still like plays melee and he's never cheated in melee right but he but he he got backb at CS yeah I I have a friend I won't name who but I have a friend who um they had a server it was like all it was like they're all their closest homies and um uh the guy who made the server one of their friends they were in a CS game with him and someone else was spectating him and they noticed that he was playing so weird and he's like tracking people in walls before shooting and long story short the guy was cheating but he was the owner of the Discord server that they were all in and they couldn't kick him and it was like a so it would they' either have to create a new server and invite all those people or try to get him to transfer ownership yeah and but without outing him probably exctly and they had this embargo where they got it from him and kept it wow what a what a political situation I I uh I think so the the the closest I've ever been to being this guy was when Tekken came out there's a it was in Tekken 7 too it was a big controversy actually it was it's a mod for the game that allows you to see real time frame data so like you could be playing a match with someone and you hit their block and you don't need to go into training mode to see it's minus5 or something and I just wanted that so I could learn faster when I was playing with people not online cuz online it was disabled but you could make sure it wasn't disabled online so you have an inherent advantage and there's threads about if this is wrong or not I asked I asked like brawl Pro and like is this wrong and he sent me like seven paragraphs about like both sides and how like how it's complicated um but you download on like a GitHub it didn't work I I didn't want my main account uh on Steam to get banned for some reason if this is considered a cheat so I had I bought Tekken on a new Steam account that's crazy cuz I didn't want my that would suck right and uh and it just like didn't work so I was like okay I'll just you know I'll learn the the normal way um but I I realized what it's like to go into your files you know install a what some I call a cheat even though it's a mod um and it it felt kind of dirty The psychosis of a hacker to me they're very insecure like they're very like this is why I think it's not death penalty I think it's jail because I think it it comes from like an inherently understandable yet equally pathetic human flaw of I'm not content in my life I'm not a winner in many places if any places and this is where I I forcefully win due to cheating yeah I I mean I can't like if you just if you tap everyone's head and the rounds over do you feel anything I I think they feel dopamine they feel awesome cuz it's just like wow they all exploded I think all the dopamine comes from I think it comes from the the respect of your peers while it lasts it's like the idea of like being the guy and getting that attention is the real dopamine it's not like what you're doing in the game it's like the I think you're like clocking in for work almost what comes alongside it you know what I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] love the apology posts of people that cheat like like semiot or even professional people like Gamers they like get caught and then they do this whole explanation ever since there was this one guy in Valor we joked about it forever was like ever since I was little I was a cheater or something like that it's like nobody cares bro just you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lame the defense I actually didn't my my uh sympathy did not come from that it was more I think the the one thing I'll give to these people is hacking and cheating uh the people who come up with these things or install these things often have like a huge overlap with people who are modifying the game in ways that help with like quality of life or help turning into good things in the community somehow and that I think that's like the one redeeming thing that comes out of it the white hat cheater not even white hat cuz I think a lot of these people who like I think about the communities I've been in where a lot of people that got caught cheating in the game and like in competitions were also people like building software that ended up being really useful to make quality of life stuff so they were black hat and they turned white hat a little bit they got flipped over the the gray hat if you will yeah I think I think you're right Jail's fine Jail's fine um because because it is the essence of gaming is is fairness it's it's we are both here to play in multiplayer gaming the cuz I don't think hacking cheating really should apply to like it's not modding it's not a single player game that you but like if you're cheating in a way that matters socially with other people you're beating them or you're cheating or a speedrun or your leaderboard score I think it's just the essence of gaming evaporates yeah sure it's the most important thing and and living with that shame is actually worse than being shot so I agree anime racist anime racist okay this is some someone so ubiquitous it it should not have any doubt in your mind what this person is like and everyone's encountered one it loading up one game of csgo one of those steam profile pictures click on one of them it's an anime girl click on the comments they're calling each other the n-word affectionately and you're like you guys prob they they bust out weird ones too it's like it's not every day I wake up and see the k word in my life they're dropping it they're like ancient Sumerian like Mesopotamian slurs from when we were learning how to food it's like a it's like a cipher but each slur is actually a different I know gazebo used to mean that yeah they're posting [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's like bird emoji NN Emoji like if you really decode it like this was the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that would get you killed in running Pharaoh oh my God my God I can't believe he said that I think they're a mystery to me really quickly small departure why do the racists often love anime what is it about that the connection yeah why don't they like house or or that's a great question Nick because if I cared about the Aran race I feel like I would like house more yeah a white guy solving problems with medicine exact it just feels emblematic of if you will that side it feels a little more connected to it so why do they like why do they like epic anime I don't know I I you know what there is and this racism is often uh directed towards black people predominantly um and I think that there is something to be said about anime not having black characters often um so it's like it's like an Escapist who I have never thought of that it's an Escapist genre it's it feels like it's your own it's addictive like candy it's an Escapist genre for people who I think like are very not not grounded in the reality of real life they are escaping constantly with video games with being online like not having Social Circles like whatever and I think so I think it it coincides in like a you watch an Escapist genre I think it makes sense if you if you aren't like it's probably so much harder to relate to things that are very re like high levels of realism to even for these guys to watch like Sherlock I I think they feel a a real friction there because you know he's the guy isn't throwing down a sword and going like I'm actually sundair and you know what I mean like like like they the the tropes that are often used and depicted in anime are so just just they're cartoons they're they're a reduced image that is more easy to chew on than the real world and so you you access that and then you start playing video games and then you realize you're a teenager and you want to rebel even further you learn about racism it's apparently awesome right and so you just end up in this and then the problem is that if you become you go through your 20s and you're still this guy it's the death penalty it is it I think in a lot of ways this can be a right of passage for most uh I don't know like you know what I what I think about a lot is how prevalent this guy is in in online spaces but I've never met this guy that's the thing have we though see I always I always wonder this someone closet am I meeting closeted anime racist everywhere at at like smash tournaments if someone and this is profiling it is if someone gives me a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up Vibe I ask them to see their Twitter profile and I'm like show me your Twitter right now and if it's like an anime profile and they're like kind of weird and they're like maybe kind of goonery I don't take a picture with them it's like you know that have you seen that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] TI Tok the Tik Tok of Travis Scott asking fans if they can name a song to sign this is Anthony's version of that it's like wait why is why is Kanye not into your Spotify wrapped until this year yes you just you just started listening huh awesome uh this is weird to jump on the train now this is a clear death penalty also sometimes you you you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the the random uh anime racist but also girl and she has like she has like ceric letters in her steam profile very R probably in like a Discord of like 20 guys and it's like the only girl in there and they're all fighting for her like racist attention oh God yeah it's kind of like did you guys see that you know that news story that came out a few months ago and there was that that school shooting and Wisconsin yeah and it was and then you open it and then it was a it was a girl and it was like that's that's her yeah you know you know what that is it's Dei it's all right next one zipper yeah next one no comment really needed for that all right always [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] always happy all right now let me earlier you were talking about our friend who used to like Blair Shrek through the mic and and just use a shotgun in CS and always going for goofy things and even if he went 0 and 30 he had an excellent time playing Counter Strike at this is always [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] always happy they are not necessarily good they're not good at really any game but they are always having a great time I I have to be honest with you this is straight to gaming legend for me wow is a gaming Legend interesting okay because their ability to enjoy games in this way is something that I find I have find so much difficulty accessing it's it's like an Untold of skill to me it is beautiful it's the other essence of gaming these people no matter how many people of like versions of them there are if they're filling out the player base of gaming it's generally good it you know what's funny too the guy in our that we talked about that fits this bill he was like he was a really he was like jacked and happy and like great relationships and what also just had a weird hobby which was you know playing games in an insane way he would he would he would stalk a tunnel in dust 2 with a Nova with like 16k in his bank and just play Shrek get out of my swamp like hard style over the mic for everyone to listen to and and he's the only one alive so you have to listen to him yeah he also sold wax you know so these yeah I think true Joy it it is true Joy um and I I think the way it's like it doesn't have to be so bum bastic it doesn't have to be shk blasting over the microphone it can just be it can be the guy who struggles with Super Meat Boy and he's streaming it to his boys in the Discord and he and he's just he's stuck and he can never beat the game he's like I'll beat theel tomorrow I'll figure it out tomorrow and then or or the guy that's been uh silver in or or Bronze in valerent for for five six years but he doesn't complain it's just because he just plays valerant sometimes that's an important guy you know I think the operative word here and always [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] always happy and always [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] always mad is the word always yeah because it it presupposes that this person's not faking the funk they truly are just they're loving it they're Gamers this I think it's a gaming Legend okay I'm with it they're a beautiful gamer yeah and we need them Zelda the Zelda man dude I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hate close your eyes I hate the Zelda close your eyes picture him now okay I want you to picture the Zelda man and I'm going to try to describe him to you okay um potentially all right uh a skinny fat male he's wearing a Zelda Tri Force t-shirt centered Triforce maybe it's green um long hair but long hair that looks like it's wet but it's not wet um glasses are not glasses facial hair but scruffy not well grown um tube socks uh shorts short Dad shoes we like yeah there's the cargo fit this is very popular and sort of the yeah this is like the stereotypical Zelda man like Florida man Zelda man uh um and walking a convention floor and okay this is a controversial one I feel they could go a lot of places on this here's so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] funny is up until you said Zelda man right there I thought you said the words I thought it said Zelda man oh that's that's so Niche that's such a that's such a a use of a square so okay this the Zelda man now many would say oh harmless maybe let people let enjoy things if everyone thought like that by the way the world would be gray there'd be no color in the world was this person not on our previous tier list well there's there's a couple repeat but the we also have we should after we place them we should see if we put the same category yeah we should this Zelda man I don't think is necessarily harmless because their their time and their money and all their resources as a gamer goes into one thing and it's Zelda and it's this it's the funkos and it's the the the the jerk off [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and it's the cons it's the sandals it's the sandals Aiden it's the sandals that they wear the socks in and and and all of it it just gets funneled into this and and they feet look like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and they feet look like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] slap they feet don't they feet may look like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they feet might but I don't think this person I don't think Zelda and their feet look [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like I don't think Zelda man is goon and adjacent in my experience I have sad news to tell you oh they but I don't I I think they like a lot of things this is what I would say this is what I would say Zelda man Zelda man is really into Zelda but I think he actually watches normal pornography I no I think he's I think he's watching like two inflated gorons like sucking it from the back uh okay look here's my argument for for net positive I think that they single-handedly hold up the economy of retro game modding without these guys would there would be no people who find it worthwhile to develop like like emulated console handhelds that you get to take and bring on planes it's like these guys in Pokemon guys no I disagree and here's why the these Zelda men in my head they come in the night these pigs they don't care about getting a cool Chinese retro handheld that you have to like hack to make work they're just going to buy it on the switch store when Nintendo tell them no I think that's exactly what they care about I think Z I think they're purists I think they play the new games on the switch but I think the old ones they're like I got to play it on original Hardware they have both and that's what Zelda they have no right now right now they're sitting they're sitting in a room that isn't their bedroom it's actually it's a game room that they They begged their wife for when they negotiated the rent and they're married and they're married always married married they're always married and they always had a Triforce at the wedding and you know what she she also loves Zelda she and right now they're sitting in front are they harmless they harmless they're sitting in front of a big black Ikea shelf that's uh squares and because they they counted them out they count and they and they inlaid LEDs to put their various gaming uh consoles and plushies and consume consume consume and they have they have badges from all the conventions that they've gone to and bought awesome Zelda paraphernalia from hanging off the cor the amiibos and the amiibos how can we forget the amiibos they have the amiibos but growing up growing up Anthony Bruno is is being 14 and hating this guy but then becoming an adult and realizing that he is harmless and you know what fine I do want a tour of his goon closet I want to see all the things he's I want to see all the cool Zelda stuff that I would never buy for myself what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happening no you don't what is this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah this is crazy I want to I want I want when he walks in a room you you smell his penis like someone opened to beef Jerky like a bigger Bel I'll never forget that penis I I sorry didn't that guy look like a Zelda man he did yeah that's what I'm kind of say walked by me in cargo shorts at bigger balk I was playing melee and I smelled his penis and I was like that's the worst [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I've ever SM this is when we met lwig he's a little he's a little he has smelly penis and he collects amiibo but he has he's he R go collect themselves he's married and he has two kids that go to an okay public school yeah and he tries to get them to play Zelda but they really just want to play basketball I draw the line at harmless harmless I agree fine I agree that it's harmless okay this was one of anon's the asmin gold Dei foot soldier which this is a gamer which I asked the exact question Anthony can you make this a gamer and he said let me explain and you know what he put up a great argument so these are the guys that um that pretty much look at any any piece of media contemporary piece of gaming or media and if it has like a female main character or if they are a black or if if they've made her breast smaller in a newer version of the game if their breasts are smaller if their hair is shorter um there are so many things that can go wrong in this person's mind something about Dei breast is so funny to breast and these people are the breast they are entrenched in in this insane culture war where they think that they have lost something along the way back when like Laura crofs had giant polygon tits and they think that because that is gone very adjacent to like the the West has fallen the West has fallen and there's no more good media that caters to uh my sensibility which is like a straight white guy um and it's it's a tragedy and these guys you know they are Gamers because they have nothing else to do um but they they're actually only Gamers they are only Gamers so and they're twitch stream Watchers they're and they and they watch they watch their you know guys like asmin gold and they also probably have [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up teeth uh this this is a clear death penalty well well well do we want to do we want to give them the easy way out cuz we put them in jail jail jail is where they belong the question is whether or not we kill them just do I do I share the same animosity for them that I have for theim we instantly wanted to kill the anime racist yeah I feel like the thing is a lot of these there's a lot of overlap there but I think the the asmin gold Dei foot soldier is more likely to engage in some sort of crusade that they think is really Noble the anime racist is kind of more of an aimless scattershot of many things uh and and actually very broad uh type of person I would I would like to put him in death penalty but above the anime racist do you mean the left of who gets who gets it first to the oh anime it would imply that the wor the very last one on the list is the worst got the anime racist is the worst it's a somewhat ordered tier list at least it's the lowest tiers yeah uh I think this is fine I think jail is fine death penalty is interesting because at the end of the day these guys still need to consume but a lot of them have Funko Pop caves of their own right and so if you want an industry to continue but the Nuance the Nuance what's important wait why do all your Funko Pops have camel toes these guys will play what you give them wait what is a spun pop where where do you even buy that yeah death penalty I'm with it all right still buys Mortal Kombat one of slimes can I uh can if you could Google something really quick zipper can you look up uh how much how much in sales the new Mortal Kombat game just made um I it's funny even though you made this one up and put it in I have had this stop before when Mortal Kombat comes out I'm like people are buying people come out of the woodwork that you don't expect that are like oh have you I'm getting the new Moral Combat check this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out 5 million units globally that has out sold Tekken 3 by uh sorry Tekken 8 by I think 3 million units wow um that's September 2023 so there's been time for that so let me just say at $60 a pup that's a lot of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] money let me just say Mortal Kombat as an IP so cool yeah like one of the coolest all time Gore just so awesome aesthetically it's amazing all the games are so fun to play like so cool conf used who is still like with baited breath like I need the next title are they a collector are they are they a hardcore fighting game player these are guys who own consoles that's it so much it comes with the Xbox so much time has passed that this this guy is climbing into he's climbing into the same Zone as the guy who still buys Madden for me like it's it's lost a bit of the novelty it's like it's like how saying like in pop culture if you said fatality in 2006 it's like oh and now and now if you did that it's like come on man is it though actually have we looped back around I I think we're looped I think if I maybe we're iron poison look look I am going to throw out a fatality for you I'm going to pick a really good time and you're going to love it can can you zipper can you Google uh the image of w Jack bell curve cuz I think that's what we just arrived at is itj moral comat I can explain this in that context uh but while he's doing that Mortal Kombat the the the amount of money that these games make every year and a lot of it has to do with I think the marketing machine of Warner Brothers to Warner Brothers IP now that's why in the game you have Terminator and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] uh it's it's it's a very morphed thing than what it used to be which is also not if you play Mortal Kombat now it still does these call backs to the 1990s game it it makes sure that if you're a guy who's 35 and you Lo load that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up you're like ah Nostalgia okay saying fatality uh is is based and then the middle saying fatality is cringe and then the end saying fatality is based that's that's where we're at in society right now I okay I want to put them in I actually want to put them in net positive because I think like the fgc globe Trotter I think they are preserving something that was and kind of still is important and cool but are they by spending money on a AAA Studio exactly it's so it's so commercial and it's lost a lot of the like flare and joy it's need to change the game need Cheaper by the Dozen four you're seeing it like like do do we need to keep making these it's more like does the guy who works at an Amazon warehouse come home rips a bong and plays Mortal Kombat story mode for 3 hours is that a net positive in a lot of ways in spiritually and the context of the world probably not it might be harmless but I I wouldn't I wouldn't call him a positive let's say like my girlfriend like makes a new friend and I go over to their house for the first time I meet her boyfriend he's a turbo Turbo like like AAA gaming Normie but he's like a old head he's playing Mortal Kombat on the new PS5 I walk in he's playing on TV I'm like is this Mortal Kombat he's like yeah it's the new one I'm locked in I'm interested I'm like watching and I'm like oh wow gaming as a but that's why it's harmless it's like it's TV for me it's so it's just there's nothing there's nothing Brave about playing Mortal Kombat and buying it again there was a is coming out this year well there's a Mortal Kombat 2 movie oh and they got [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the guy from the from the boys that's him right oh yeah that is the boys man I met him it look it's going to be a forever IP until civilization collapses we will know uh that Subzero shoots Fireballs shoots ice balls sorry I'll settle for harmless but I think it's that positive I'm a harmless harmless harmless it is up next we got the stardo valley or the maple story girl yeah zipper pissed off that we said girl at the end of it I mean you can be a stardo girl and be a guy mm let's make SM made is a maple story girl yes he is or no stardo girl sorry sorry St well okay here's the here you actually made stardew and maple story their same category I would argue that they're different cuz stardew uh maple story is an MMO that you like grind and play stardew is more of like a a compact single player experience um but we can still let's put it this way maple story Girl might go in whack playlist but star star new girl might go in might go in harmless yeah cuz maple story maple story girl has a a ven diagram sliver with anime racist M maple story girl has BPD oh yeah yeah yeah she's got she's got some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up bangs but Star new girl but Star Girl St girl you take home to Mama Star new girl is fine she's fine she's got the thing about Star new girl is like she has interests it's she's great stard I don't even I don't really care that she plays stard it's like oh it's cool you play stard Valley like it's if you have never sat in bed with a Nintendo switch with someone you're dating and they're playing sardu and you're playing it have you really been in a relationship good question so let's let's I'll fix it after this let's separate them and let's Place both of them okay so starting with the stardew the stardew girl um she's I would she's harmless I mean net positive how fun is it to be like uh yeah I play uh I play Super Smash vers melee yeah the old one yeah on CRTs and she goes oh I play stardew Valley and you go that's awesome we're connected yeah like it's I think having that social glue and being able the challenge of being like a hardcore gamer to navigate that as a mesh and be like actually I can find a connection because you just said sardu Valley and it's not no video games at all it's actually not positive um I would I would argue gaming Legend cuz anecdotally every person I met that is a stardo girl has been very cool well let's pump the brakes I'll settle for net positive on that you want to you want to silence women you want to put a ceiling maybe perhaps over there just bit of glass they can look through it it's just like it's just stardo girl it it's nice because you both have it's like oh we both play a video game but inside I'm like be brave try something have you one of the funniest things I've ever watched was uh Alex when he plays stardo and he about maple story start Valley sorry which one did he play I can't remember okay sorry I didn't play either of these games they're in my head they're the same even though I know Story girl maple story girl that's maple story this isn't yeah she's dangerous yeah yes she's dangerous maple story girl is posting some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like the real body count is the amount of men you've put in therapy like that's like you got to be careful she's our first whack playlist in my opinion I point the stories that I've heard about Maple stoer maple story girls they make me scared okay you guys play so gos game I'm clearly Go game out of my element here so you guys place them yeah I I I agree maple story girl goes in whack playlist stardew girl goes into um I net positive give me that net positive is good I agree I'll sep so put it in net positive pie of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's just a step down from gaming Legend I Love stard Valley the low tier main now now now this this extends I wanted to extend this outside of just fighting games cuz I think this person they're also playing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like pre patch yoru yes and they're and they're also like they're playing they're playing every video game they play they intentionally take the route of the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the oh look at me I'm playing the dumbb character cuz every time I lose it's like well I play a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] character and every time you lose it's like oh my God you lost to my my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] gimmick you're hedging they hedge it's a low tier option select it's very celebrated and the Donkey Kongs the Luigi's it's the Cornerstone of the the the concept of a low tier character is having this option yes I think we need to put these people in jail I I think that's heavy I think that's a heavy burden to put them to put them next to hacker and cheater I like you saying this because you I don't think you've ever taken this path of resistance in any game you play Funky Kong you play Chic you play you don't you don't you you don't play low tiers but you have sympathy for them yeah a little bit why cuz I think I I think that putting them next to hacker and cheater feels feels wrong I would put them in wack playlist CU on the whole I I agree oh wack playlist is better I think I agree with the whole thesis that Nick has it is you do a lot of protecting of the ego that's why it's good when a low tier a serious low tier gamer breaks through andsa if you will who's not a low tier gamer he believes in Yoshi he Yoshi or that happens with Donkey Kong Donkey Kong or like it's happened in a bunch of games where like there's a difference between someone who genuinely pushes the character and doesn't just play for the novelty and truly believes that this character will not stop me from winning I will find a way to win with this character versus the guy who's like let me do the cheese and I the the let me do the cheese guy he's not cheating and I don't want put him with the cheaters but I don't like him I play when I encounter him in the game I said you're this is miserable for both of us because you you know that you can't beat me with this character and I know that I'm going to win that you suck all the joy out of the game this interaction has nothing left to it especially this is the worst this is the worst symptom of low tier low tier gamer or low tier m is I notice on slippy this is a phenomena in melee I'd love to know this carries to other games is when I play unranked the people that are most likely to quit out on me after like one game or mid game or low tier players who are getting [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up yeah cuz they cuz they show up to the party and no one wanted to see magic tricks yes and they're like oh I guess I'll leave no one cares you don't like it when you face the reality of your choices Oh that's oh that's interesting upy out of Shield that's awesome bro I saw that when I was 10 it makes me miserable that the the Reddit will be filled with post of like why won't anybody play any games with me and it's like I make a point to not quit and play with them and then they quit on me and it's interesting who are who are you who to do that who are you who who's capping here and you know what's funny too with uh a lot of things can come down to design I experienced this myself with Tekken when I picked up the game uh there's a bear in it his name is Kuma he's a bear that's crazy and I was like no matter what I play that guy yeah and that's different that's different when you when you spiritually connect to a character that's the beauty I was what I was thinking of is like that guy can exist with any character right it's the the guy who maybe Mains Ice Climbers or I'm trying to think of a lower tier character say you love young Link and you dress up as young Link at tournaments you're the same as the guy who mans puff and dresses up with the puff t-shirt on you just happen to have chosen a better it's not about the tear it's about your your connection to it also to be clear before I get crucified Kuma is very good in Tekken uh eight he's like he's insane so but I what I'm saying is no matter how good or bad he was I was going to play him and there's a low tier main that kind of subscribes to that and is self-aware and it's the ones that aren't that Sully the good name of the rest of them and this is I think a w a clear whack playlist clear whack playlist an excellent way Game and Watch dude oh game watch players [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] eat some dog [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] oh my God wh World nyt bot yeah yeah yeah so this is one of mine um dude this might be me these are the people that are like they're like whle posting and they're like they're like posting their nyt times in the group chat and they do it every single day the hottest girl you know is doing this right now the most beautiful girl who happens to also be reading this the thing is that Nick Nick I I feel the energy on your side of the room and I want to jump in that pool but the problem is this is so many people in the world right now it's like there's also a lot of Nazis a people so what's just's your opinion there but I think I think there are so many people from very different walks of life who don't have a like a competitive bone in their body that just like do they but they all come back to this point of being this person and and it's it's too large of a spectrum of people that all do this is what I'm saying I I think I think there's a distinction to make care of people that are so into it people that treat it like it isn't just a daily thing to like kind of be like ah it was Grease and then move on with their lives they're they're like playing it like it would be a much a much more complicated game you're not just doing you're so ripping the posts every day yeah you're ripping the post and you're like maybe you're even like on the whle subreddit or you're playing like the duo Deco whle with 64 of them which can be fun U but you know what I'm saying like there's a different type of like casual person who does this like a normal human and person who takes it a little too serious oh do they have goon and it's like you get like an areola and you have to say what porn star it is that'd be crazy dud how has this not been done well let me just check we have we just created a billion dollar company would be if it doesn't ex we got a lot of programmers in the Ard Community goon um just want to throw that out there oh it's a it's a surname so ancestry.com go family history you guys you guys both made some some good points and um I'm going to go net negative on this because while I do think the general engagement and consistency is fine I think playing these games is cool and fun I think I hate when people still post their Wordle Emoji score lines because it fills group chats unnecessarily and it's who is this for why you got to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] roast your awesome mom like that bro my mom she's not sending me that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I I actually think net positive because I think I just value the idea of like my grandma respecting a game like she's like I like my grandma puts time in in her morning to play a game and I feel like that just I just respect that she thinks that's an important use of time she past is she pasting the score and sharing and competing with other well the dementia really makes that kind of no uh yeah she thinks she thinks she's posting a song Sometimes yeah yeah uh I think I'll be the tiebreaker here I think these people are NE negative because they could simply every person that is taken away by doing an nyt game could instead maybe be playing a different game and eventually reach uh like elen ring they could eventually reach something that I respect more and when this stands in the way of that I think that's a problem these could be melee players your grandma could be playing melee you're your hot grandma could be f for you guys out there I really do think I really do think you're net positive oh the Val the valve truther the valve truther oh my God their favorite video games T Source TF was the best game let's play some Garry's Mod [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Prop Hunt anyone want to play Prop Hunt Prop Hunt get on that yeah any want to play portal somebody M up the log me in haachi server dude dude 1.6 literally was the best game this this is the best game forever should like ruined by the Bots it's you know what they got greedy and that's the problem it's funny they're simultaneously glazers glazers and uh truth truthers I really got that out [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the New Zealand bunker that that that game is going to live in that game is going to R Gabe new is going to be mummified in a sarcophagus in New Zealand and you are the reason why because you think he's some sort of Legend when really he just bought he just created a market place he is he is the Jeff Bezos of video gaming and you think he's a God the and it's crazy The Orange Box The Orange Box and I love these [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] games I deserve this I'm 34 I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you you know how important halflife is to my life the first computer case I ever had I spray painted made and spray painted the Lambda halflife logo on it in Orange Orange on black I'm a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm the guy who this is for here's the difficulty because valve games are just they're so good like every Valve game is so good yeah it's it's difficult because they're like a hard arct that was aom that was an insane attempt that was just a and they pressed a big button at at valve and and to release it and they thought it would be like a rocket launch but it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] B bom yeah but usually they hit and so when people really really love and play every exclusively only every game I'm like I get it aesthetically gameplay-wise like just awesome uh but go like Touch Gaming grass go outside and and touch the the green pixeled other games that exist I mean I I would argue that a lot of times they do but they end up playing like these guys are super adjacent like Ultra PC Gamer guys they've played Metro last Light like a hundred times like the these are the guys that Gamers Nexus videos are made for it's just they spawned the the they they are the origin of things like skibbidy toilet and things like that well it is a Gary's M I know it's from but not the origin insane to say that no no no that's if we go all the way back if we dig deep I'm not saying I'm not saying that cultur but they are the they are the Advent of like making something or like a medium popular that is the the root at like that type of the head the head in the animation expanded and he made a loud noise and it's funny taking the assets from the video game and creating [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] posts and I I feel like that's done Untold damage to me damage or cultural building blocks I think Sky toilet was important I think it's the same [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] as like red versus blue libertarian Environ look I think these guys are whack playlist but I I recognize what they have contributed but to be a valve truther in 2025 is to be whack it just is they just they they also if you've met these guys they rip they rip certain words with a callousness and they're not necessarily I wouldn't call them outright like bad people but they they operate within a social sphere where they don't understand why saying those things aren't okay well yeah cuz they have awesome like you know nearly seven figure software developer jobs and they wear Polo shirts with a 9in Nails logo on them and uh and then they come home and they they play valve games and and that makes them whack I'm I don't know out play they they also somehow have really long hair and are also balding it's tough they're doing both it's to go that same time how do you do that you you know what tenacity mhm um mobile mobile gamer mobile gamer this one's cut and dry not too much to say I do think it's pathetic what part of it um because it's it's just is David Chong pathetic it's picking a scooter when you a skateboards right there it's just like it's just like have you seen have you looked in a mirror while you do it I want to I want to make an important distinction here the guy on the train who the guy on the train who's like oh guys do this at the poker table too that I think I think there's a there's a difference between slightly between this guy and the gacha gamer and I want to make an important distinction okay because I think the if we if we think about this in a in a global sense a lot of people just are mobile Gamers by proxy of not really being able to afford a PC like that's why a bulk of mobile gaming exists is because most people just have phones expensive and they and this is just what they play games on that's the mo no phones are $800 now no cuz you can get them with your plan and you always need a phone I'm not talking about I'm not even talking about the US I'm talking about like India I'm talking about like soue mob that's most mobile Gamers sure sure sure sure sure if you include countries outside of the US of course so the fact that you're socioeconomically prejudiced is a problem we can talk about later look this is my experience with the mobile gamer it's like you're hanging out you're all having a good time you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] maybe you're like at a bar maybe you're at a friend's house and one person in the group is is and you go you go like oh what are you what are you doing and you're like oh I um I I play this mobile game and I have to like do my daily unlocks for and you're like oh that cool and then it's not if Fizzles it's nothing I'm not interested and also you're not participating and you're addicted and and you get nothing at the end you know what's funny an ad pops up and you pay the company now imagine if you do like that mobile game try really hard is it somehow fixed if if it's like if it's their melee and obviously it's different cuz melee is cool and this is lame uh and we we all agree we all agree with that but if you by happen s love the same game that Mr Beast liked playing when he told us about that that's a net negative I I think that is that is kind of if if we're that what Mr Beast was doing is kind of adjacent to what Nick is talking about and if I were to Zone in on that version of the mobile gamer as this person that we're talking about that person's a net negative I think that like like Twitter Twitter is like a mobile game kind of where it's like you pull out your phone and you waste your time and you and you destroy your brain and I think mobile games are somehow even a worse waste of time sure where it's like I don't think you need to take gaming out of the house like that I I I I actually think it's good that you go out in the world and you don't play video games on your phone I think you put the phone in the pocket what what if you're taking a train to work and you play a switch game every morning that's I think that's better I even think it's better for the mobile gamer to have that use of it but the mobile the the modern mobile g Pokémon go has destroyed this the modern mobile gamer in in America in my eyes is the guy who is not really hanging out while you're all together true because he's on his phone and he's locked in interesting he's mobile gam that's a guy about to turn 30 uh the mobile game market share is $92 billion yeah it's huge okay yeah and it's all it's also I feel like a more a more overt cash grab than traditional gaming whereas traditional gam is also a cash grab but like mobile games are just inherently cuz there's there's better Hardware by a lot out there with computers and whatever and so if you're making the game for mobile I think you have like a goal in mind like maximize profit be in everyone's pocket everywhere I can't wait to play the next awesome Ai mobile game and I think if you bought into that I think you're a bot uh you know what I'll buy it net net negative if you're a mobile gamer you're a Droid mhm grandma speaking of yeah so this was slimes uh you said you had a lot to say about this I did yeah you said you said the we were talking about I thought you did no you said I can say a lot about that that's why I wrote it oh you know why is cuz I wanted to uh have Aiden explain about a grandma gamer cuz he did earlier and then me explained that I wanted to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] his grandma that's the only reason I you should have just let him run it I wanted to put this you really could have P that out it is funny to just say what my plan was uhen what is your grandma story on Grandma Gamers maybe not specifically my grandma not be confused with nyt bot not to be confused with nyt bot yeah that's a more that's a more advanced gamer go on but this this gamer she she might pop open solitire on her Windows XP PC that she still has it's really slow yeah she might even Venture into something like uh mind sweeper she she might even she might even uh in the car mutter the answers to a radio show while she's driving is that g is this gaming it is gaming it is Gaming Full House and and it's like full Jeopardy Grandma play Jeopardy Grandma's love Jeopardy or maybe she grinds a non uh purchasable puzzle game plays like digital Scrabble but stuff like this and and and there are but there are grandmas who are doing that every day all the time with a bunch of the clear clearly harmless oh bingo bingo yeah okay these people are the people that uh are getting their social security gutted um they're harmless and they're beautiful mhm okay and we all secretly would like to have sex with one nope not Aiden we'll talk later okay the a rammer a rammer not to be confused not to be confused with the the the League of Legends player because to me an a rammer is an even an even more pathetic thing really yes I do you guys think it's pathetic dud all all the AR I know are happy imagine being so addicted to your people listening half the people listening are playing Abraham right now imagine being so addicted to the way your binky feels in your mouth that you're like I just have to chew it I I don't I don't want to wear my diaper anymore but I still want the binky I still want to I still want to click that around and I still want oh he hopped over a wall no I it's total like bro just play the video game or don't but just quit or don't don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] micro do your PO toxic relationship with League of Legends by a ramming what is a different okay what's an example of an aam like in a different game is it like death matching and valerant um Spike rush I guess it's like death matching no it'd be like Spike rushing it'd be like only Spike rushing all the time you'd be a psycho okay but people who are play there's a lot of people that aan I know I know and there are a lot of people who do fenel Anthony it's almost like like it's not it's actually more pathetic and Lamer but it's almost like surfing where it's like you love how the the engine of the game feels so bad that you just do something touch it all the time but it's not even at least surfing is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] different surf CSF at least surfing is like it's a little relaxing it's like an exploration of mechanics that you don't get to use in the main zipper you can't hear it he's cheering as Aiden's talking in the main game it's like I can't boot into Mirage and and then comp and then surf like it's it's a different thing I think the AR rammer is like they're so afraid of who they are and how much League they've played but they're so addicted that they can't commit to the full match because they don't want to admit that's who they are and what they want and they also can't let it go and they're in purgatory it is it is a horrible spot to be in when voting a league Cent it's different it's different maybe you really love league and you have and you have 30 minutes before work so you just que and aam because that's all you can get it's that if you are playing more than three arams in a row you are lost I I okay I want to put them in jail because I actually think it'll be good for them they need I think it'll be they should definitely be above hacker you know that scene you know that scene in in uh why can I not think of the name the famous the famous [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sad heroin movie oh requim reum for a dream the scene in reum for a dream where he goes to jail and he's laying on the table and his arm and you can see all the veins in his arm that's what happens [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lock and they need that detox they they need to they need to the suffer the withdrawals and then come out the other side way better that guy also in that movie got such a better deal than the other two really cuz Jared or Jared Leto got his arm amputated and we all know what happened with Jennifer Connelly so that guy just went through withdrawals in jail and then can be fine later and then was fine hopefully was fine all right the menu gamer menu gaming these are you know they I I think this term was coined by Northern lion uh it's B my was it uh I just heard him say it okay okay uh so yes he did coin it it's like batro it's like any any game that is played through a series of menus and numbers yeah um I think these guys are you know somewhat close to my own heart uh because I this these are the kind of games I end up playing a lot oh you know I think they're net negative why kill yourself but they are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] conversation poison like have you ever been in like a group of like friends who also all Gamers and someone's like bro I had so many [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Jokers last night and the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] banana broke or whatever and you're just like no one care all right hold on hold on I think we have to pull back because I while I agree I think this applies to any genre of game that the like the rest of the group you just never played banro I can think of this fck the social situation I thought of the social situation I thought of was one night we we had like a game night or something and a bunch of our friends were hanging out and there was a mixture I would say probably 20% of the people at this party or this hangout were like let's call them normal people instead of normies I'll be less pejorative they were normal people and we were talking about the rest of us were in the living room talking about xqc and something insane that he had done this conversation was something that the other 20% of the people in the room definitely could not understand or engage with in any Capac the and you know what though I could make them care about that I could be like yeah this guy's a kid gamer who is really rich like like like hundreds of millions of dollars and they're like what why and I'll show them a clip and they're like why does this make money and they're in but if I'm like but the I got the Joker I got the Joker I got blueprint and then I got blueprint and and it's not I don't win mondy but it looks like gamble I okay okay okay listen listen Nick has a point because Yingling was playing lot of batro when when the fires were here all I did it was such a paradise I would hang out in the office all day play I would play I would play League i' Play like 10 games of League a day and then in between I would just play batro yeah and and I would just wait for the fires to not burn my place down and um and you check the fire app and it still say 0% contain like surely they'd be at one by 1% would be nice to see maybe lie to me does zero mean we haven't started or that the fire is winning every fight yeah and so but Yingling was here and Yingling also played batro he's like dude I've been playing batro and I realized it was going to be a boring conversation but I I I extracted me and him extracted all the value we could out of it and then we've never talked about Bater again so I get it the problem okay look if I tell a story about how oh at this at yesterday at the party you had to play Josh's puff to win a prize interesting or hey in Mario Party miles tied with a computer for mini game funny conversation about batro is only fun for people who played at batro what I'm what I'm saying is that what you're true about and even more true than you know is that even people who play balatro much like poker no one cares about a bad beat story I think it's also it's like hearing their dream it's like we both dream and I don't want to hear about your dream I don't care that you got like this many with this many Jokers cuz I wasn't there and I didn't feel it and I didn't get to you know at least at least like league players their game's miserable they're miserable but when they when they talk about it with each other and they're miserable I'm like wow this is kind of funny you guys are I'm entertained by your before we place this how was this different than inscription it's not but it's so much bigger that it plagues so more conversations if if if if inscription heads were like trying this hard to have convers the beauty of inscription is that you can't talk about it without spoiling it so people will just say you should play it and those guys including myself are annoying is that not also a menu gamer no no no it's a deck builder I gu I guess B kind of but it's not the same as batro where I I would I would call these there isn't menus but I I get it it does feel different but I'll leave this one to you guys I think it's different cuz yours is like a story that you unfold which batro and other other games like it are about beating scores high scores anyway um yeah you actually convinced me that the menu gamer while maybe not as social as they could be it's net negative I don't think they're whack yes they're n negative idle games too yeah yeah yeah yeah get like R well I think we have RuneScape coming up on here Cookie Clicker all right yeah negative yeah okay so net negative net negative let's go dude the triaa gamer the slop eater the lassic the the the undead husk that just wanders through this planet you know one of these guys uh the old uh personal trainer of lwigs and mine for a little bit uh Christian such a great guy I love that guy I would I think if that guy said hey I'm I'm going to war will you come with me and be in a trench and fight on a Ukrainian front he's not a Ukraine he's from like San Diego I I'd be like I'd be like Christian I will because I like you man he was this guy okay every time I hung out with him and talked to him he'd be like dude I just replayed Resident Evil 2 for the fifth time and I'm like that's awesome dude he's like yeah getting a PS5 so hard isn't it it is this guy's a net positive this guy might be a gaming Legend this guy could be a gaming no no no wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait there's other people that aren't like Christian cuz Christian doesn't really know listen Christian Christian doesn't really know what Reddit is okay he he knows what a PS5 is and he knows who Subzero is but he doesn't know what Reddit is and I think that makes him kind of special and the triple a gamer [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you've convinced me they're they're not positive no yeah I think you're wrong I think you're wrong about this because the majority that's the beauty is most of these guys actually are Christians I would love to think that I think the thing is they and by buying triple good AAA games that launch and and being into it they're like the guy you know when you see those Tik toks of like like wife influencers are like here's my husband gaming and it's like and it's this guy it's yeah it's like it's the Star Wars game that just came out he he played God of War and he played Uncharted and maybe he just bought Uncharted because it was Nathan Drake looked cool on the poster he's playing on a TV that only swivels this way yeah it doesn't do it's way high up it's so high up it's above the fireplace God yeah it's above the fireplace he is the he's kind of the lifeblood of like why quality AAA games can even still exist he he they even they they they support the economy at a Super Bowl party they're who you're going to talk to they they're they serve so much value talk to and most of them and and slime that's the thing most of them don't know what Reddit is and that's beautiful I will I will allow these guys to be net positive yes if we agree that they are the guys that don't know what Reddit is necessarily sure yeah okay and I and they go in net positive okay but also some of them know Reddit and yeah those are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up genuinely S Club Penguin is gone okay okay so I put this one in so these are the people that they swear Club Penguin was so fun and so like do you guys hear it's closing down forever it's like you weren't playing it no one was playing it that's why it's going away this is also no one plays it this is also the person this is the same they're actually the same guy do you get the title is deceiving this is the same guy the person who's still talking about Neopets in 2020 and how much fun Neo shut I it's fine it can be gone and we can still think it was once again I'll stop you here cuz it's the hottest girl you can think of who is doing that right now so chill on that and she works at Applebees and she's wearing an invador M T-shirt oh my and and she she chewed the the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pigment out of the the sleeves yeah she she and she chewed a thumb hole in her Volcom Hood she cheated on her last boyfriend yeah in Discord yeah yeah yeah uh so yeah this person is well you sound like you have contempt yeah this person deserves to be in The Wack playlist because I think that they uh I think they're the type of person who believes there's nothing cool anymore yeah they're they're only interested in their own Nostalgia they're only interested in the idea of someone else finding their own Nostalgia interesting and worth talking about and to be revitalized cuz you know what if it was cool and we all liked it it would just ad make money for someone and it would still be around as someone who loved Club Penguin and got really into it and mid maxed the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of it when I think about that game actually now it sucked it's a terrible game I never played it so I don't I play Club Penguin and there's something undeniably cool about it aesthetically it's really cool like when you played it as a kid it was amaz you're walking there people and you're talking to them it's crazy it's there's so many cool things about Club Penguin but I think that I the possibilities with CP are endless is really what I'm trying to say sorry uh you know what's funny is like so people do Lament The Death of CP as much if we have beaten that joke they called it that in like the community and in like and in publishing for the game so it's like borderline official that it was it was borderline official CP sanctioned CP and the kids to it and the kids wanted to be involved no I'm I'm sorry not and you found a way to break the he bailed I if he kept going I actually pulled my Paro P so the problem is not that I don't think Club Penguin is cool the problem is that the person who is clinging on to stuff like that just they're so annoying I think that's makes a lot of sense I think you had a great argument and uh I agree whack playlist I'm fine with that I never played it oh that's fine I'm fine with the placement yeah let's leave it there let's leave it there okay oh OSU player okay okay OSU player I separate it from Rhythm gamer because I do you think it's a typ of person they're different I they are I do think they're different I look could I be could I be blunt with you they're weird they're weird people I've never met somebody who's really into OSU really into OSU who's normal not one it's true but the the one person I can think of immediately is Goodie yeah goodie OSU is her twitch name right so she was like it's funny cuz she plays Fox too and that's what Josh always says it's like she just wants to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] press button she cannot stop the Saving Grace of OSU is that it is so difficult and something that hard I just have to respect someone who's grinded it and got that good but their P their their smell is peeling the paint off the the the walls doesn't smell bad I'm going to pull this back pull this pack I want you to think about I want you to think about melee I want you to think about melee Community the community that we love so much and it's a little weird it's a little weird right a weird but we've kind of I would say we've ironed out the edges a bit because you have to show up in person and participate and be a functioning member of society if melee was only online it would be osu's community and it would be weird wow this is something I I haven't really confronted and I think that you bring up a really good point uh what does this make them does this make them enemies ORS I don't know if weird means like I I don't think I'd put them on in whack playlist here's the problem is like weird will often lean into socially uh maybe annoying uh it'll lead into like to be to be conventionally weird is sometimes interesting and cool and sometimes just weird in a way that's uncomfortable um and it's you just have to share that designation because there is like like speedrunning Community is weirdos but yes weirdo positive where I'm like yeah well it depends it also depends like I guess it does depend you know there's I think a ton of people speedrun who are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] weird and they like would suck to talk to and then there's a ton of people at speedrun who are but also speedrun some speedrun communities are just the low tier M and and they're doing it in like they're finding glory in a niche speedrun it's the same thing dude it's that's like miles playing Jackie Chan Stunt Master and being the only guy who can beat another Brazilian guy it's so interesting this game also sits in a unique place in my mind and the people who play it because I think for years years I knew people who were OSU players but I did not know and I'm not kidding this I probably went more than five years like this did not know what the game was or what it looked like I didn't know I didn't know anything about it I only understood the game through the people who said they were OSU players that's and that's important that's context and I think I would put them they're in harmless in harmless they just annoy me but I but the game is so hard that that it's beautiful that they're so good at it so I just have to respect it okay I'm good with harmless the Nintendo beta you call him the Nintendo all right so we've already we we were coming back to the well on this one because [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] man me and Aiden hate this guy I don't know about you maybe you have hear you guys you love Super Mario so I think that you're actually doesn't love Mario it's not about Mario and you know it's we actually covered this guy in the last tier list episode as its own guy in general uh so this is different from the Zelda man this is the Nintendo guy he is just so he has he's the W Jack he is the W Jack he has he has the amiibos he has the funkos he's watching every direct he's so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ripped about the direct bro he's yeah he's so pissed bro he's he's tweeting at Nintendo on Twitter he's excited about the direct but then angry about the direct every time and I just and it's been year it's been years yeah this cycle seems to never end and his salt and pepper shakers are like a red mushroom and a green mushroom and and he bought them on like arcade1up.com dude when he went to Japan the one time in his life and he came with about $4,000 and he came back with two suitcases full of slop full of Nintendo slop he has a he has a bathroom rug of Mario's face cuz he just had to get it so this guy is such and he's like when he go he like when he goes to the mall he has to stop in Hot Topic cuz he's like honey look mushroom mints these are cute also that's the thing it's not just that it's not just that it's about it's about some it's about how he's ex he's also excited about how Final Fantasy 4 got dropped on the on the wi Shop Channel it's literally it's every piece of slop that Nintendo will drop into his mouth and he licks it and licks it off anything they put off the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Crispy Cream glaze printer from from the Nintendo Factory either accept fully or be severely angry about all his are like like like 20 lbs less than he really is in yeah he he has like no joke like 7K hours in Mario Kart cuz the game's been out that long he sucks said Mario Kart dude he's not he doesn't he has 7K hours but he's not good and he body bought all the DLC yeah he can play as link now he's link now now Link's in the game now cuz he's link now in the game now I think it's just there's a difference between the Nintendo fan who does the Nintendo beta this is an important distinction I think we should make yes does the Nintendo beta believe in pirating or they no no no no no no no no they because Nintendo hates pirating and and they're the guy who's on Twitter literally saying just buy the game they made the game you don't talk you can't talk to a mangaka that way I I I I I always have felt like the guy on Twitter is someone who like doesn't play these games and is just like a logic man whatever and that the Nintendo person is like they want to get their hands on any like they have ROMs they emulate it's tough he can go in a way are consumers their go both ways he can go both ways and that's the these guys are they're they're consumers the the beta is they want to buy simultaneously the guy who is ex he he wants to Pirate because he's angry at Nintendo but he's so desperate to Pirate what they don't sell because he's such a big Nintendo fan or he could be a purist who has to own every game on on every console and its correct form and it's I I think I just come back I I come back to it in my head still we filmed that episode two and a half years ago and I think about it the way I sum him up is he he gets excited when octopath traveler comes on in the direct and I just I don't know how to connect with that guy it's I feel like I connect with a lot of people in my life and I just yeah he's wearing that's so funny cuz you connect with most people I know you'll famously use a a translate app to talk to your Uber driver and this guy you can't oh this is this guy's sick though play that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] spin that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] oh this do you know the song do you know who this band is no oh it's Falling in Reverse this is Ronnie rad key no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] way yes that is a large part of why this is hilarious that is sick so the unironic version of this guy is kind of the Nintendo beta in my head 100% yeah there there to to to wrap it up there is an arrogance to this person and a over defense of Nintendo and the IP and all these things and um they love to I think they love to come at Nintendo but then when somebody else comes at Nintendo they're like then they got a problem it's like uh so what are they uh jail put them in jail I'm fine with that I hit Nintendo like yeah they're like they're as bad as a cheating a person cheating cuz ultimately I think Nintendo games are so amazing that it's like can't knock the hustle it's like a valve truther sure but but you also don't need to defend it's like you can let the Bad Games bad all right Minecraft Roblox kiddo a Minecraft kiddo these guys so these guys are going to be these guys one of them is going to be the president I I was going to say that I was going to say I would be careful what we say here because in 20 years time when the laws change I would like to be free yeah I would like to not be uh put in a goog and made to to work um so yeah the I don't the problem is I don't know much about the Gen Alpha right that's what they are now I don't hang out with kids I saw a kid wearing a shirt uh I went to a taco place two days ago I saw a kid wearing a creeper and it said game over and I was like that's awesome that's Timeless the coolest show that was in Target when I was grow yeah he bought he he begged his mom at Target and she was like well yeah it's closes you need those and it's something you like I don't have to fight with aome yeah um I mean I think okay here's an argument for them being net negative is Minecraft and Roblox and uh there's a lot of slop and especially with AI now like Roblox has become a way for like kids to make money and like learn how to hustle which I think is actually kind of damaging to the idea of being a kid um I think making a cool mod cuz you thought it was fun and then is cool but then making a Roblox game because it can get to the top of the list and then like you become some sort of like weird Mogul because of it is not good how about this Roblox is making kids funnier do you think so oh definitely yeah cuz they're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] posting at a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] unprecedented age sure yeah and they're consuming [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] posts and that makes their their sense of humor sharper over and over we found a way to make ship posts make sense to kids and so they get funnier way sooner you you appealed to something very important my general impression of these two specific games is I I feel like of anything you could be playing the way you get to like build and make decisions in these games it's just good you get to be creative in these games listen if you are a Minecraft Minecraft has been responsible for I think a very a very recent scar on society which has been smers and I think that to be responsible for such but the Minecraft see the the Minecraft player the kid who's playing Minecraft is very different than the Minecraft YouTube SMP fan s SMP are so lucky to have made J schlatt because they made such a big pile of SLO in the process yeah yeah yeah he came out of the factory like like watchmaker Universe like it's crazy that all the pieces fit together somehow and he's like he's funny and like normal M Minecraft is is the game kids play on the iPad at Chili's like it's it's different they're not playing it they're watching it all right um I think they're that positive then you know we got to you got to hand it to them just like Isis they're they're they're potentially no they're not leges and they're not harmless because they will harm us yeah yeah yeah next n positive n positive the speedrunner speed Runner these guys well oh I have a question such a big umbrella I was I have an important distinction what's up are we talking about people who they speedrun like a game maybe a couple games that they like or they the fgc globe Trotter and they get a little into this game get a little into that game but they never they never stick out and push whatever dominates the majority so it's probably the second one I mean okay look I played I played neon white a lot and I I like grinded a a time for one level the Clock Tower and it was really fun am I a speedrunner I would say no I think speedrunners are like that's the content they consume that's the games they play they play games that have speedrun categories you got to be a little more dieh hard then I I would I would argue that they are either harmless or net positive because they probably support the speedr running community which is like awesome yeah I think I think at the end of the day they're just heads they're just insane hardcore heads and even if they're trying to low tier some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] or like Globe Trot they're doing something that takes just an insane amount of rot work and maybe we put them in that positive because at the very top the the speedr runners who are creating the biggest speedrun content are it's some of the most awesome content about gaming I'll go harmless you don't want to give them net positive no I wouldn't say they're you don't think zfg is net positive that's crazy you want to say that to his face no but that's not the guy you wouldn't say it to his face I'm saying they're harmless but if you include all of the popular ones it shifts it up couldn't that apply to so many of these categories no speed speed running also it's like it's it's just melee it's just fragmented melee it's the same Obsession we we talked about this in Old episode yeah we did I think they're net positive because they're just a mirror of what they're the very bottom of net positive okay sure they're a mirror of what we love all right uh I'm good with that PC purist H yeah PC purist like oh my God you console game I level okay these guys are I have a question because maybe this is the maybe more a sign of how I have changed the way I consume like online media but in like 2010s like in high school maybe in college this was like a really pervasive person on the internet like I it was easy to find the PC Gamer I don't feel like I actually see this guy very much anymore like I'm not saying to to change where he goes like is this guy kind of dying out I no I actually think that they haven't died out it's that it it's become like it's become more polar like I think the in the transitionary period where like console gaming was turning into PC gaming and people and there's some people who got it and they were like it's higher quality it's better graphics it's whatever you're stupid you haven't caught up yet now it's like console gaming is very much this type of person and PC gaming is very much this type of person and they don't need to fight because they're not sharing the same space anymore yeah they're not competing against each other in the same cultural way maybe not in the same way I feel like the way it happens now is like it'll be in like war zone it's like oh you're a controller like a console player and that's funny though CU you you you have to see the game tells you Europe against if you force them into a box they they're piranhas They just kill fish but they don't they don't get in the same box very often so PC uh the PC Gamer guy was based on the idea his historically that these games are look better and they control better and they're more in like they're more in tune with being a gamer and a console you're just given the the machine and that and that also has even doubt in a technological level because a PS5 is very strong and powerful and you can play alen ring at 60 FPS and you just buy the PlayStation and it's valid console gamers are more valid these days so the the lines have become thinner uh between these guys as well um so what that means is to be a PC Pur today on this planet Earth in the year of our good Lord is way more cringe because you're you're grasping onto an idea that was already being elitist and now you're arbitrarily elitist yeah for even more arbitrary reasons I guess it's gatekeeping it's gatekeeping the magical world of video games but gate gatekeeping is awesome we've been doing that this whole time but to to gatekeep having a a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] computer yeah there is a level of that where it's like okay and I again I think playing console Shooters is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stupid Mouse all the way but I'm fine with wack playlist wack playlist is good I'll settle with this that's fine they don't deserve jail we kind of need them but yeah I think I think wack playlist is good all right racing Sims okay so this is the person who who has the setup like this is the person that like like I I don't know if you guys have seen like pictures of these but like they have like a they sit on the ground and and their monitor is is like low it's like it's like it's like almost on the ground to and then they have a wheel and they're they have the full racing Sim kit and that's kind of all they play they just play games like that I remember seeing Summit 1G have a setup it was like the ultimate racing Sim set was like nine grand and he's like in this like what looks like a a mall massage chair yeah uh yes yes they always have these crazy expensive [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up gear and this yeah this is like a there's a there's a broader version of this it's like Microsoft flight simulator guy it is like that do do we have them in here no we don't have that one no but they're basically the same gu okay yeah yeah the Sim guy well the flight Sim guy is also extremely different um because those guys are just Pilots that didn't go to school like they have the same mentality of like you know like your dad's autistic he just is right so and they have the same like I need to operate a machine that I can control with all these I need to fake operate the machine that I would lose in the Indian Ocean so nobody would ever be able to find it the question is it we kind of turned into Old Boomers when we say this is like why not just go buy a car why not just go go ride car that's that's why it's fine to me this is like this person is basically it's it's like a person who uh buys a snowboard but rarely goes snowboarding or buys like a jet ski and almost never uses it it is fun and they like it a lot but they spend a b of bunch of money making this crazy setup for something that is fun and it's like but they're not as it's not like they're using it every day they're not Gamers they're not really Gamers thing they're not Gamers they're like hobbyists they're hobbyist they might as well be building Little Ships the reason why I believe they're net negative is because I think they make us look like dorks I think if you go on redit and you type in gamer you're going to see a guy who's got a setup like this and he's like check out my set that's what you see it's one of the ones you can use people like it's the people who are posting the the setup of their goon cave that has the racing build and they're like check out my awesome build and then they end up on [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] modern day funny junk and then you see it's like uh like top five most expensive gaming setups and the normies think we're dorks maybe no I okay that's that's where I diverge here because I think this person is more often a normie than not there the Normie is the type of but the problem is they don't fit in either box they don't fit in the gamer box and they don't fit in the Normie box CU they're doing something weird so they're just this like this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up version that makes everyone mad well if they're in a box they're harmless cuz they don't they don't affect anyone else but they affect us by making us look stupid so they're net negative and this is our chist and we we rule we're awesome I'll settle either way net negative net negative move on Steam deck steam de Derek all right steam deck Derek is is it's like okay the switch wasn't good enough for you but you do want me to watch you play video games in public and yes I know you have a steam deck I can see Steam deck guys will be like I have a steam deck by the way yeah and they're going to see other guys and they're going to be like they're going to be like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] looking over at the group and they're like are you watching me play on my steam deck he steam deck yeah no it's the two terab version yeah okay bye any game he makes any game he makes me makes me grown he just makes me grown I think it's like ah you know it's a steam deck Derek yeah that guy right there no he's not you know why no he just plays become Derek you it has to leave the house he brought it to the office what about he brings it on planes I don't think okay this is if you have a steam deck to play on the couch also this was also the distinction I was making in my head because lwe has a steam deck but he's not really a steam deck Derek nice place to play a steam deck and it's a guy what is that on the wing of a plane that's a bit of a steam deck Derek what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is that that's not no that's an insane person I love that well the thing about a steam deck is like gaming is great but like it's the guy who's always [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] talking about his steam deck that's where it begins and ends for me it's a guy who hates his girlfriend so much that he needs video games when he leaves the house yeah they're they they went on a vacation for a week and he brought his steam deck and she was you brought your steam cuz we can play a board game in the hotel room and you can still get the gaming and he's like it's different can we not have a we weekend dere different Derek please my name is Kyle don't call me Derek steam deck Derek [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sucks and he's annoying I think he's just a net negative though I wouldn't put him in whack playlist negative I think he's whack playlist because once again there is an arrogance to the guy who has a steam deck and that arrogance makes you whack no you're look at him you're over no no no no no no this guy is going to kill your child One Day ring the negativity that he brings I want you to look at it look at who's around uh the low tier man the these guys are the same guy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cringe heavy social faux Paws from the others and Ste der pulls it out of party and I'm just like and and I'm just like Derrick you brought your steam deck but that's it that's the it's a NE no you know why Aiden because steam deck Derek you're not actually hanging out with him because he's steam deck Derek you don't give him an invite to basketball cuz [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that guy of course everybody gets an invite to basketball even you got an invite to basketball damn means a lot when you say it that way and you're always [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] always mad I you're outnumbered he's black playlist move on and we [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] move on grab the next one all right war zone only yeah this is C br/ The War Zone only gamer he it's like he was on our every guy list he was he was on our every guy list and I think he the here's the problem here's the problem is he votes against his own interest he votes against his own interest he just does he doesn't he thinks that he thinks that the the the stock market which he's not really sure what it is don't aski is going to turn around he works in an Amazon warehouse but he doesn't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with unions it doesn't make any [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sense yeah yeah he's just he's just a a he's a Droid uh who left to his own devices could probably figure things out pretty well he's not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with gay people no he really doesn't his clan tag is manga H God because he thinks it's funny it's Le funny but also low key low key I also voted for him Y and it's like and oh and you know when a girl pops up on the mic God forbid he's saying some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hey baby yeah it's just a hey baby the the only the only decoration in his room I think I've said this before is it's a football jersey a framed fo framed football jersey um and maybe like maybe like a whiskey glass that he got like at the airport just a culturally vo that says like the like says Green Bay Packers on it he would be is it okay here's a good question does he listen to the new cardi no it's Mumble WAP to him yes okay it's Mumble WAP the Cod BR is like dude the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this shit's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and and then and and then he throws on Eminem yeah he does think Eminem is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tight he [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] loves music is not like that anymore either it's lost oh this guy drops now and he's still into it I I mean I it's funny how we kind of if he's death penalty the only the positive thing I'll say about him though is it blows my mind I had i' I've told the story before but I had this experience in uh Middle School where the best Call of Duty quick scoper at my middle school was this jock a dude in my school who was a jock and I'm like how is he both how is he both a jock and good and good gamer sometimes you're both and cod Bros they find a way they find a way to be both jocks and also like 80 input per minute Gamers yeah um I mean some of them some of them are you know they're they're just as they're built like the rest of us uh I he might be he might only be in net negative I don't I'm I'm I'm at War at least whack playlist if not jail because there's a there's a tinge of of authenticity to him that well of of like what about what about when what about when Bose said take a picture of your teeth and and post it on Twitter with the flash on cuz that came from the mind of a Cod bro they have they have an unbelievable ability to insult they have a creativity that's been cuz they have to adapt they're like a they're like they're they're like Mera they're they're like a bacteria that's like immune to modern medicine they they can just hurt you in ways that people have never been hurt before they would kill Napoleon despite everything they persist with words alone it's it's that to me is kind of beautiful so I think they're an negative but I don't want them to go away entirely cuz they they kind of they're kind of like clowns yeah I you know what that's a great cuz like I think FaZe Banks is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lame [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but man would it Ricky but but would it be sad if he were like not around here's the yeah would you know what this is this is my little little Difference Maker is all the people in wack playlist I don't really want to talk to them but this guy chop it I'll you're interested at least chop it up you're curious I'm curious in COD bro that's a good way to put it I'm not curious about steam deck Derek no he said everything he needs to say no he's more he wants me to be curious and I won't be no he wants be me to be curious about his steam deck mhm that's good okay uh blockchain gamer blockchain Gamer does this exist death penal just death penalty move on don't even need to have the conversation okay Discord poison or the cord nuker this is the this is the person who inevitably is the reason you make the new Discord because you don't want to kick them from the Discord it's too competition so you make you make the new Discord you invite the people you actually want to play with the new Discord is formed you have to get rid of the legacy of the old one it sucks for a while and then the new one becomes the new one and then it happens again later someone dates someone that invites someone and now the Discord ner is here he's the reason he's the reason the A and gaming center exists a and gaming center is a a cruel but just Wasteland but but proven it in its value utilitarian not a not a kind or a or a warm place it's not kind nor is it cruel it's it is it exists it's the needle that in injects the vaccine I think they deserve Jail uh the reason why I don't think they need to be death penalty is because surely there's a Discord that they do fit in in like there somewhere at some level there's people I hope they find it I hope they find I hope they find it so they're not in M you what Aiden it won't be mine it's not going to be mine I value my time and energy too much I think Jail's good I think it makes sense uh one last note was um I forg oh yeah 30% of all the advice questions we ever answer are about how to deal with a guy like this yeah a lot of them are have someone in our friend group who is like the racist in the call I don't know what to say it's like yeah all right that's fine table Slammer the table Slammer or the baby rager or the this is the person who gets so mad at games they they this is the difference between always [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] always mad is this person is a Vibe Ruiner this is a person that you you straight up just can't play games with because they ruin the vibe [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] always bad so not anybody that slams a table not now now now hold on there you don't get out of this one just you don't Slither your way out just yet now I fit into this category in when we used to play melee I think I was a table Slammer yeah one of the only people I've had throw a controller at one my set ups at one of your setups yeah you threw a controller when we played who cares if it was your setup I'm saying in my matches that's oh no no not my setup like at my setup the one I'm playing at like like like one of the only people who's thrown a controller while we're playing I thought you were on some like and it was my TV I've slammed a table before yeah you're haven't you people ever heard of um I I've done it and you heard the forks bounce off the table and it's like what you got dude Kyle slamming as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and hearing the series that was classic cuz sometimes it's funny but this yeah this guy I think is uh I don't know if I'd go jail but wack playlist whack playlist it's now it's you Aiden it's you Aiden you slam the table you slam the table I slamed the table I've slammed the table in my day how do you feel about that uh I'm evaluating it based on the parameters we've described I don't think and and I found zero wrong I don't think uh in I don't think I fit the description of what this person means he's a table Slammer I'm a table Slammer you're a table Slammer wait oh he said I'm one I'm not a table slam I've slammed maybe one or two table in my day you've slammed a table because you're not a table Slammer I just wanted to see how it felt it's about does your anger decimate The Vibes to a point that people don't want to play games with I've never table slammed I've never table slammed outside I've only done it alone like rocket League ones is like the only time I've done that you know the vibe thing I forgot about that I don't think you're a table Slammer in the vibe uh Department I think if it's I think it might be jail I have been at like I've been that person in my life in a in a moment but it's not jail because it's like in general this person you don't want you don't invite to play games you don't want to play games with them but like you hope get it make us mad they're adjacent I think they're like a slightly better version of Discord poison person because it's not that you don't mind them in like normal social sets you actually probably like hanging you actually probably like them likew but when you tag like hey any c sers in the chat you hope to God say yes and they say yes you actually just go idle and you go ah I've got to go to the church store with my girl exactly all right um wack playlist is good wack quack quack uh Sports only Sports only the Madden the FIFA 2K gamer well well well boys they did listen to card they did listen to card's album they got some thoughts the V diagram of card album listeners and Sport Circle yeah yeah and it's going to be my one time what and we're going to put Sports only in death penalty oh my God because because it's just it is unimaginable to be the person that buys FIFA and Madden and plays only those games and buys the new one every year it is unimaginable to me that you could be that person have you played uh NBA 2K Crea character mode um I have seen people play it and it looks like a good time have you seen the parts where you can decide which brand deal to take which brand which brand deal to take like like Gatorade comes up to you and and and then your bench pressing and dude dude they kind of they kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cooked they he uses one time bro I'm putting Sports only a death penalty I've never we can talk about it but he uses one time I tried we can move on I've never had an ounce of fun playing them I do not understand why people play them it's like be bring a little joy into your life and play anything else next to as someone who likes playing sports oh c JD uh one time one time jail one time jail one time jail one time jail one time jail one time jail courage JG one time jail all right wow back to back excellent that was so fast all right league rer league rer oh man all right the League rer this is the the is this shake not the a rammer yes but Shake actually is uh League Roder positive he's still it's still like grossly pathetic but it's like but like I like shake the league rer is like censor this or don't censor this Zeke come on okay this is the person who has played league for such a long time and it they they're like oh dude League's the worst game ever don't play it and it makes you it's the worst game it's the worst worst worst waste of time ever but they still play it but they never quit and they boot it up and they rip games and they're miserable and they just they never stop the league rer in my head is the guy you interviewed and uploaded oh like that is the worst version of him that is the wor that's the bottom of the barrel and I'm not saying they're all like that but it's it's with within the scope of that category is like the person is doing exactly what Nick said and they are undeniably sad to some degree and in some form because they continue to play league so actually I think the the key thing you pointed out here about the league Roder which makes them uh definable in in this tier list is the flagellation and the uh negativity about being a guy who plays league and and what's important let's make let's make an important distinction who's not a league rter who plays a lot League miles miles miles actually talks like here's why I like the game here's why I don't like the game but he's very honest with those glimmer in his eye when he talks about Le like that character is really fun [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] game and so he can't quite be a rer because there's a pleasure there that he also makes his League stories funny they're they're not just miserable one-sided he's not just telling me his dream and this guy was just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] unemployed for like 30 minutes yeah stuff like that um so I I think that they're better than the a rammer because I think at least they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] play the game and they have some of the anime racist DNA in them they really do it's not I'm not saying outright but they they also just have an addiction man well a rer can also be I mean we love Zeke we love him and he he if he's you know considered a league rer he hasn't played in a while to be fair to him but Zeke's also he's Zeke's an a rammer honestly I I misspoke um that's my slime I'm sorry so I guess it's I think wack play is fine wack playlist is fine cuz cuz jail has to be different I actually yeah I respect them more than the a Ramer because they are playing League of League of Legends they buyy yeah they're not going to Disneyland to eat the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] turos and the hot dogs they're going on rides going rid I don't care Disney adult it's pathetic but you're going on the r at least you go on the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] R you play the rides that you m all right uh goon and goonette goon and goonette I imagine them as um Toad and Toadette from Paper Mario yeah um but they are the uh the gals and and and the guys and gals who are playing video games purely for sexual pleasure and to beat off dating Sim players dating Sim uh anything with balancing breasts um honai star rail awesome thick bulges or animals with bulges or um does this include like second life rping kind of like jerk off goon like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nasty sesh a little bit criminal criminal if you're in the right server it really does I think it's like it it has a strong Erp and gold Shire says zipper zipper knows game yeah I think if you I think if you're a per it's like I think if you circumcise your Sims character and you're white you're a gonar and I I think that if you if you if you've had close-up detailed VR sex in Second Life you're a gonar and I think if you've beat off to any kind of of Japanese crafted pixel you're gunar what if you have like hold on oh who no that didn't come to a camera now let's go then let's go on hold on a second hold on some a fine crafted Japanese material does the gooner let's say someone only plays dating Sims but they've never beat they've never ejaculated are they are they chubbed are they a goon yeah they're a goon okay yeah they're too afraid to you can name more than like four dating Sim games it's it's wait what what do you mean if you can even name more than five games in that genre yeah there there are 700 million we all know about doy DOI mhm it's it's the ones that you don't know about those scary ones I okay okay potential doy DOI spoiler just to say this I don't know if it's a spoiler it kind of is I so many people talk about doky DOI and they talk about Le plot twist they talk about Le genre mixx and I was like I gotta try doky DOI everyone talks about it I hate dating Sim genre so much I could I couldn't get past the point before whenever it turns into like an interesting game so I never got to the point people talk about I just played the part where you're in a dating Sim because I just couldn't stand doing it I just left us offline it was too much friction for me neon neon white is a an amazing game that I love but it has like probably like a 100,000 words of dating Sim that you have to click through and you you know that the first screen that showed up and it's voice acted by [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Steve Blum and the the first screen take any work he's Samu Jackson you want bust in your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I'm like you know what click I just I I didn't see I didn't read a single [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] word and it's a beautiful game any anyway um people who listen to the Y on 2x go goon and goette goonette I think they're jail I think they're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] gross cuz why not just like I think jerking off to porn is pretty normal if if you're I think it's just and if you make we all be if you make it like this thing that's like your entire personality and like it seeps into like your hobbies and your like playtime and stuff and it's like yeah maybe you're like a kink person sure I mean I'm just vanilla so maybe it's hard for me to understand it's just too much hear me out gaming Legend let me explain they took they they made they they took all of the the they took all of the damaging aspects of pornography away and they found a way to ethically beat off no no not at all I think this they found a way to ethically beat their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Aiden and no one's being hurt in the process everyone's winning Nick is so wrong cuz I know some people like this and they're not they're not ethically beating off they're not wait wait wait wait Dark Twisted people like this it's it's like they you're you you play that you do the ethical beat offs and then you clock into your night shift you do the unethical beat offs they're double dipping you do both if they're doing that kind cuz I know what kind you mean yeah I take back that they're not gaming Legends but I just think that gaming Legends is the highest honor you can ascribe so I think it's crazy maybe they're just too sexually deviant maybe it's just too big of a r I think that's it it's they go to jail where they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] belong and they can learn to jerk off from thinking about stuff like a normal person yeah it's fine but put them above courage J it's just there's a little thank you and put courage in the cell with the gooners all right next one Michael transaction Michael transaction this is the uh a whale they they every single game that has the ability to pay for things they do they only open Counterstrike to open cases they pay they have so much money in Pokemon [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] card cracking games they like they this is Michael transaction he is spending so much money on games that are purely dude but he's cosmetic boosts and the problem he's often not wealthy he's usually not rich he if he was good with money he's usually I'm not going to put it there but I think isn't Mr Beast a Michael transaction uh you know yeah all right um this guy I mean it's hard I don't think I'd ever using the rubric of would you ever talk to this guy I think I would you know NE negative this is might be one of those like harmless uh this guy's supporting all of gaming with his person supporting [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] games that suck is unironically C he's the dude who he is the dude who is keeping freet tolay games alive he's the reason that all the other people can play for free because is it funny how that's a good point isn't it funny how free-to-play games most people end up paying more than the price of the game yeah absolutely that's hilarious that I mean Psy it's a bit of Michael in all of us but there's a lot there's the bulk of people who play for freeo playay games are AR ultimately aren't spending like an extraordinary amount of money on it right they're not paying enough to if everybody was like the base level free-to-play user if everybody was they wouldn't make enough money to run the game yeah you're right they're necessary they are necessary but it depends also on the the the how well the company is willing to give you the freeo playay experience like CS is good because you can play the whole game for free is Micha transaction is Michael transaction a gaming Legend is Michael transaction also the reason that the systems that can abuse the gambling part of your brain exist in the first place Michael transaction is a double-edged sword but he's a net positive because of what you said for all the non- Michels they get huge benefits Michael transaction exists so a kid can play fortnite for free but that kid because Michael transaction exists is also susceptible to buy so how do I evaluate that cost and that benefit it's tough you have to do it for yourself well is gaming good yes then he AET positive positive net positive easy done deal FPS only only plays FPS games only FPS guy um this was almost me I'd say I played a lot of SPS games almost but then you know smash saved me yeah yeah smash save it brought me out I played other games and your and a gting drive the Mario Karts um the okay here's my case here's my case I thought at first maybe this is harmless but I think this person is a net negative because I think the pervasiveness of this person and the popularity of FPS games on the whole have kind of sucked a lot of the joy out of new games getting made especially at the AAA budget level I think a lot of like like picture this some gaming announcement E3 equivalent thing is going on like uh I don't know PlayStation does their Big Show and then they're like and now one more new PlayStation exclusive title and they like announc some crazy G it's always some reskinned Destiny ass looking FPS game and it and that's so many that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] FR new one I don't know I watched some gameplay of 10 playing it and I was just like can we stop it's can we stop with this nonsense and valerin look they did it they did it pretty crazy right just leave they made they made you're saying they made a new one they made a new one and they did it pretty well that's the thing I think it's just I think them choosing to only play those games has had consequences on the quality and variety of games that are able to be funded and released well how is it their fault if they just like the genre and I don't I hate this guy to be fair because because it's all of the people that buy Madden every Year's fault that they get to keep getting away with it I see okay now how is this different from the fgc tourist or is it you know you know you know what scares me about this guy and makes it a little bit different to me is it can only contextualize the fun of video games through the firsters uh murder of other of other people sure they've only found the fun in video games when they're holding a gun and shooting it and maybe that's why all the school shootings are happening and it's probably it's probably is a one toone correlation AR15 hom kids in the grave uhuh that's a bugging Banger song the difference between them and the fgc globe trer by the way is because so many of these games are not competitive games they aren't games that you play it necessarily even in a multiplayer environment you're talking about like Destiny where it's like you do like insane dailies every day and it's like flop treadmill yeah Ty a lot of these are story mode or one player or co-op games too it's the general format that applies across all of these things it's not just the replacement of like what's this new ta shooter attempt or something like that um I'm with it I think I think you you brought up a good point that they help perpetuate an industry that is already stagnant by uh just paying for the new slop harmless you say harmless yeah you say net negative I say net negative I made my case why do you think they're harmless do you tie break because to me it's like it's like there's so much cringe you can say about them but I I just I can't none nothing they're doing is affecting me no I I agree with that part I don't think they I don't think they're necessarily cringe at an individual or like even as at a group level I'm saying the consequence of their actions is is more clear-cut I think they're a little cringe not negative I that's democracy at work they got to be at the top though somewhere right they can't be at the very end of that dude poemon yeah okay the next one is Pokemon goer and I have a quick so I was in Little Tokyo eating breakfast and while we're eating outside of this little cafe uh a group of people with multiple phones in each hand and backpacks walks by a small it's a small group Ma and then a few minutes later a massive group of these people walk by and I was like oh my God Pokémon go has still got it like that there are giant Pokémon go social events happening and they're all they all got a backpack they all got phone chargers some of them have most of them I would say have two phones in each hand two phone baby ke Chad in in Australia he is like he is like the Godfather of Pokémon go out there he he goes with like random members of the Australian like the Melbourne community and he's like they don't really know he's a YouTuber yeah isn't that sick he's their god king also guess what just happened Saudi Arabia's Sovereign wealth fund just bought the game they bought NE antic yeah holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] isn't that tight that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tight bro that's dark [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the oil money is buying Pokemon go why is pet Town covered in oil are there any are there any gay Pokemon that shouldbe not anym maybe yeah I was say change their ID or something like that um well I I put them in separate from mobile gamer because I think they've convinced themselves they're exercising they are no this is this is okay this is why I think net positive is I can't really I can't really make fun of a game that ultimately just makes people walk all the time but I I think that the I I would put them below that I mean I would put them in NE negative because they're so not interesting there there is just like no but they're just like yeah I play Pokemon go so yeah they're harmless I guess I I don't want to know harmless yeah they're harmless sorry guys we we we love gaming so much this episode is going insane Nintendo DS at the gex show okay this is go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] okay you know what I love wringler that's my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's my slime but wringler was playing uh I think Magic the Gathering on the ground in front of top eight at Genesis like two years ago and I was like in my head I'm like ringler get that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] off the ground come on stop it the performative gamer the the hey look I love ringler too I'm not necessarily talking about ringler with the Nintendo DS at the geex show but when I when I see the pictures of the person with their Nintendo DS taking a picture of a concert but their phone is off camera cuz it's the camera taking a picture of their DS taking a picture at the gex show kill your just enjoy stupid horse it's what you came to listen to performative Nostalgia somehow worse than regular Nostalgia perform it's like I don't need to know you have a Nintendo DS I don't need to know that you paid $80 at a thrift store this month for that Nintendo DS no one needs to know that you charge it and the battery is wheezing and it's got 10 10 minutes left I mean the same thing is sad uh Peng Club Penguin is gone um this is I want to make a quick distinction I feel like this is like this would be very different from the person who still carries their 3DS around in their backpack to see if they get Street passes some you know what I mean what are Street passes like Street passes are when two 3DS's like are close enough to each other you like exchange like me data with the other person and you get to like collect a little passers by and you get to see like who you met that day that's cool I bought I bought some people do it I bought it to replay uh the Zelda games uh I'm I'm a Zelda guy and uh the it's it's such a shitty little device but that's it's just like it's not for anybody it's for you like it's this little piece of Joy between you and the other 3 has nothing to do with Nintendo DS this is about it's about holding it up above your head in public and saying everyone look at me I have it yeah it's wack playlist it's whack playlist it's perfectly whack playlist put in the middle I feel like it's everybody still cracking CS cases on a laptop screen yeah the joke is over it's like okay somebody did it yeah the flake let me explain what the flake is I wrote this one the flake is the last person you want to have in a balers gate game or the person who's like oh 100% I'm down let's do balers gate that sounds so fun and then on day two they're like this is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] low key I don't really want to or they don't even respond or they never show up and all of a sudden you're playing their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] character the flake is also the person that's like yo CS tonight you're like yeah yep tonight comes they never show up they go online tomorrow they're just like I fell asleep the flake is Alex smokes smid it's Alex smok smid he is the flake he might he might as well get a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tattoo of Tony the Tiger [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this and we need to put him in jail yeah we in jail because gaming gaming Aiden it when we're almost 30 and some of us when we're when we're gaming is a thing that we unfortunately we have to start scheduling we have to be like this is when I'm going to game I cuz I I it means so much to me I want to get it in and when there's someone who doesn't value my time that they're just going to not show up and ruin the experience for everyone he wouldn't like jail no he he be popular in jail extremely popular you know what he'd make a lot of cool friends I'll use my one time Alex you know you you already used have yours right I do and I and I'm keeping uh I'm keeping Alex smokes made in jail let's put the flake above a rammer in jail sure okay the achievement hunter uh you know okay honestly a sweet story uh the one of the first guys I ever met through melee was this guy uh he was a Mexican smash player his tag is uh I think it's Walker w k r he was with another guy from Mexico that came for Evo and we like hung out uh me and my friend Eric I didn't know anybody he played samis he was destroying me and he was the nicest guy uh he added me on Facebook we never ever talk talked ever ever again but he says happy birthday every year oh my God and on his Facebook page he was documenting a 100% completing Wii U games and he's like ninth ninth wi like it's one of his Hobbies is to game like that but he also like just played Mele he was a a good s and dude if you're out there man I hope you're still [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] completing I'll just look him up Facebook later but um it was so cool and every time he would just update his Facebook wall with playing Wii U games 100% completion cuz that's what he was doing and it was so Charming just because he was a cool guy I think I think the Achievement Hunters I think they are gaming Legends because I think that they they truly want to squeeze all the juice out of the lemon they really they explore the whole game they play Everything the game quote has to offer and the the developer of the game when someone's like you did all of it that's awesome you I and they don't harm anyone they don't they love they love gaming almost assur it's true yeah a lot they love it so much and 100% of all of the people that I've met that are like this in my life and they've never been too like in my face about it it's like it's usually for them they definitely can't resist saying I 100% of it when they say they played it they can't resist saying it but you earned it yeah sure and it's not overt if that makes sense it's it's not they're not heavy-handed about yeah there's a feeling too of like for for instance Yakuza zero is a crazy dense game there's like you just spend like hundreds of hours on the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mini games and someone the other day was talking about like dude I spent like 15 hours on the baseball mini game and someone else who has done that can be like brother like it's a trench that you willingly go into and if you find someone who has also done it that's huge um also if your like memory card per se were to like stumble into a thrift store and someone were to find it you would be the most interesting it would be crazy to look at what you've done with your life my friend Justin uh growing up he got he had Pokemon blue and red and he got on one cartridge every single Pokemon and had them all level 100 it was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy God the amount of time it was it was insane he showed me it was it maybe he had a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] game genie I scrolled through it but I don't know man he just he didn't seem like a cheater he was really proud he drew Samus and put it on his wall yeah he did that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you know what he moved to Japan years later he said he hates women it got weird well he definitely all right next one I'll have what he's having this is the person who only plays what everyone else is playing oh they have no like favorite video games they're playing what squeaks is streaming right now they're playing they're playing like they're just playing whatever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is the game right now here okay what a gross little man this is I think he might be a net posit if look if you invented trick shot simulator and then Northern live picked it up and now thousands of people are buying your $6 game and making you a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] millionaire yeah he kind of I I think it's less about like how he like less about the shame of catching the trend and more he rounds out the the group if anybody wants to play something new he's always there and always down to ride and I like that but he does he lack the essence of choice and what if you put into what if you put it from slave killer the game the awesome game where you kill a slave well if he's having it got to try it it's we didn't say he's a void of morals well maybe he is if everyone's playing it xqc just got a brand deal to play slave killer the game where you kill a slave you know they didn't need to have the title be so long cuz it's kind of in the first part but they wanted to say it again you're having to make up you're making up this guy now you're straying from what this guy actually is games like that are never the game that everyone's playing this person I think this person on track this person is just a guy who loves gaming and rounds out your group for anybody any game idea that anybody has and I think that's a good guy to have I think I think I get pissed when I ask people what's your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dream and they say I don't know and it's like what's your favorite game and this guy says I don't know so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you I think I think where I agree although I'd rephrase it I think most people don't know what their dreams are I think that when I say to someone what's your favorite game and they're just like uh tabletop simulator or like something like kind of they recently found out about they don't have any like history in gaming they care about they don't pres attribute any like Legacy or like you know their favorite movies all just came out they can't think of an old movie they've seen or liked or that meant anything to them to me I'm like you're a little boring but I agree with you I think that they're necessary yeah they they support Indie gaming the cost of the yeah low cost High benefit fine I think they're bottom of net positive I'll give him net positive the thrower thrower I mean if you played League of leg someone to me this is this is not someone necessarily who like this person's included but it's not just the person who like starts to get tilted and then throws they are included to me it's like the person who cues to throw they cue to troll yeah they miles has some serious uh understanding of guys like this cuz he plays so much league and he plays on himself and and he Smurfs when he wants to relax and the the the person that has a just a burner account fresh to go and just runs it down it it really is a person it um it is how they extract value from the multiplayer game is that making people upset uh and it's really interesting cuz i' I've never known a person like this they have to go to jail they have to go to jail because I think they death penalty dude oh you you to to to buy and play a video game that you don't play it's there's you have nothing of value for society there's nothing about you that is good I mean well there there's this like there's no belief that you will reform after jail you'll come out and we'll still want to kill you there's this joker esque well to be to be fair jail takes their time away from them and that's what they've been doing the whole time to others oh so that's kind of fair but also to kill them uh would feel good would feel good to do and their blood would explod I think they're I say to me I would say jail because to me they're akin to like the hacker or the cheater it's it's the qu the first question that comes to mind is like why would you do this but then the answer is psychological you want to exert some sort of control or a desperately attempt to like fulfill desperately fulfill a need that you have I feel like they want to feel some sense of like control and like power over other people yeah it's a good point if we throw hacker in jail we're gonna have to throw thrower in jail or we throw them both in death penalty let's put them next to each other and put thrower under hacker okay yeah I'm with that yeah or it's got to be the opposite sorry that's fair above hacker yeah all right okay I I Shifty capital F capital t under lowercase y 1K Subs on YouTube this is your yeah this is my dayon this is your valerant player probably immortal like has they paid for a banner on Fiverr that says says their name in 3D letters and has like awesome blue energy all over it yeah and it has in the image the names of all their socials which is the same across he has an Instagram and he has his Twitter on his Twitter it actually says an X stream to like two viewers yeah yeah and he streams like yeah two to four people and he's always like talking about like he's he's always hashtag small streamer posting he's also talking to his community he's talking to his community hey guys to just pornbots mhm and and giveway giveway retweets and replying to tens and being like you're actually spitting dude he can't commit to do people look at his Twitter or not he's either retweeting giveaways which is like no one looks at my Twitter core or saying hey guys at the start of a tweet which is I have a big Community core um these guys are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] miserable they're also their gamertag is it's it's constr I know you don't care about gamertags but to me it's constructed off of elements of what they think a popular gamer is like I I shifty is like they've seen it so many times that they don't even realize they didn't think of it yeah yeah yeah it's just like you just take Lego pieces of other people like that and you just cram them it's like a phonetic salad that makes no sense together um think the I these guys are miserable um because they're they they play the game they probably play a lot um they they're better than guys like me but the irony is that I'm a bad player and people watch me which is you know a cruel way they to perceive the world they don't have webcam on their stream they just have a screenshot of a character from their favorite anime no but if they do have a webcam cuz I would I these guys are the guys that kind of invest in the idea and so they'll buy a webcam and they'll have cool overlays and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah they go full overlay and they and they look over at the chat and it's just never moving and look this isn't this isn't a rip at the small streamer this is a rip hard to make it's like they're good enough at games to believe they have a chance at being like a YouTuber but they have like nothing interesting about them they're they're not investing in the idea of actually being entertaining at all they're trying to Coast on the idea that one day and they have like branding famous yes they're Fally misunderstanding the idea of being interested in a streamer I would like to see this person in whack playlist I think the the ones I'm imagining are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mean I actually want them in harmless we are so spread apart oh really there's just troves of them and we don't notice 99% of them that's a good point I'd go I'd be I'd compromise and go net negative on that what do they what do they negatively influence my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] think they feel they they they have the audacity to occupy space on your timeline but then again but then again they're like an ad as Nick points out as Nick point they're like an ad it's very similar to an as you point out most of them you never see they're an ad with no product most of them you never see so does that mean harmless I think they're harmless cuz you so many of them Ed there're trees in the forest you there's so many of them you just don't even know exist I'll go harmless on that fine yeah but I hate these [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] guys uh all right what is this runc sko these guys I mean I think this is jail these guys just play RuneScape and they and they and they see teeth in the walls and yeah they they there's just they can't form like natural bonds like a human what's the difference between a RuneScape and skito and there's like a cape that they're really interested in finding one day um and it's just crazy it's crazy and I don't know much about RuneScape but if you talk to someone who has played it and they're always talking about numbers in the terms of like millions and millions like yeah so this cool Cape I found cost me 700 million GP I'm like that's a high number I feel like that shouldn't be the way what's the what's the difference between a RuneScape skitso and like someone who played back in the day and has a lot of nostalgia for it and when it comes back they like oh I'm so excited I'm going to play the the remaster the reboot old school RuneScape let's go I think that it's it the difference is the skitso has it on all the time yeah you can't disengage from RuneScape like RuneScape is a second monitor game and you see you put it well you see teeth in the walls ah Sancho yeah San yeah do he dies in League he tabs out he plays RuneScape he goes back he has never not playing a game yes Liam when he speedruns Mario he has a very very tiny RuneScape window that's always on in case he fails a run I think the RuneScape skitso is the person who has it on while they are playing another game by for sure you can't just you can't just play one game at a time you have to always be playing RuneScape yeah and and there are some people that full boox RuneScape and those are the true people that are you know writing writing on the walls with their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me to me they're to me they're oh man I actually think they're harmless I think they belong in jail they're only hurting themselves I yeah guys that's what I'm thinking is like if you have it t no you're I want to put death penalty your one time they're evil they should be put down like animals okay can we agree to put them above Rock blockchain yes okay wow wow all right we next we have the G the silent ghost the silent ghost okay so this is the person who's literally good at every single thing they do every game they play but they are just so Meek about it void void this is like void this is like it's crazy I mean gaming Legend has to are they above or below evil above above because Force but the Force for good is more important than the force for evil slightly you know what's funny is that Tekken has a lot of these guys like silent goats and I think as an American they appear silent because I don't speak their language because they're from different countries um like KNE inen you know and it's like silent goat you just you really need both and I think that and this is unfortunate but this is my real take if all the goats were evil it's more interesting than if all the goats were silent and good I I disagree I think I disagree it's more it's just simply better television brother it just is I think I want to agree with Aiden I think I think silent goat is better because I think when you're when you're when you're a goat and you're evil it's just like like can't you just be good and not complain can't you just not be annoying cuz you have it all I think when you think about who the oh maybe this is tough CU I thought of other examples in the moment that I was drawing that thought I was like cuz a silent the silent goat could be like sh Otani right now in baseball where he's like beloved you know and he's not allowed to speak because he might talk about that gambling [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he might talk about that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but then I thought about Michael Jordan kind The Evil Goat yeah but and not CU Larry Bird he complain yeah like Larry Bird's a bit of the evil goat and no but they bring they just bring a beautiful balance you need maybe you need I know but like I you do both but the question is I I I'm asking if it was oops all evil or oops all silent I think if you're all silent there's nothing bad about you you're just amazing you're just you're just you're I think that is a story that people admire more like that version of the goat is laed collectively it is but in in contrast to the evil uh it just is no I don't think so I think in I think in contrast to ourselves examp maybe an example is like maybe Messi and Ronaldo Ronaldo's kind of the Evil Goat of the two sure and Messi's the silent goat I think we don't compare them to evil I think we compare them to ourselves cuz we we look we look at them and we go if I had what they had I'd be so annoying about it and they're so cool and not and I can't do what they do and they're not and that's so crazy and or or tennis a better example I can actual tennis example Federer oh feder jokovic is the is the good Evil Goat and I think if people have to pick when given the two they pick the the silent goat they pick the good go I think well it's also like more people enjoy it from a periphery than they do like who are heads right like to to understand the beauty of how arsel asash plays is different than like just seeing I don't know some some boisterous like player that is different you know what I mean like AR and Ash existing is more important than the evil Tekken goat equivalent existing I think I think so too I think to the broader narrative and success of like the game and Community things like that I see lean being so good at games weirdly him being evil I it makes me get why he's good at games more I see his like his like iron headed will and like his like tenacity whereas like the silent goat they're like they're like they have Aura you know what it is it's Aura it's like omnipotence almost Aura is important you know what I mean they have and if it's oops all Aura you can't really lose and the the evil person has Aura sometimes but a lot of times is just minus Aura Punk has hella Aura though he's evil as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but you see when he crashed out on lein but that's why butur then it's like a I think that's the thing right is that it can kind of SL it's like they need to like ride or walk the balance beam of how to be the evil goat and it can go against or in their favor uh and let me let me WR another example for the silent goat winning think about it not in the context of Competitive Gaming think about it in like speed running in like in like Dark Souls [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 100 pering like the person who's just like quiet and says a kind of funny thing every once in a while and it's just crazy good I want that guy more than I want like the guy who's really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] annoying about the game yeah and is like and like and is like talking [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in the whole Community they're both gaming Legends but one just edges the other out one Ed we got to get through this I think we out vote him yeah but I would like to say can we put always [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] always happy above both of them he is the he is the heart and soul that's the salt of the earth all right is that it no no no the multiplayer this is someone who only plays Aiden only plays multiplayer games doesn't have the doesn't have the object permanence or mental capacity or anything to play a story game they don't find Value in it they don't want to you put them on breath of the wild I play games to beat someone else at the same thing we're both doing competitiveness what's the matter with you have to beat somebody what is it what is it no jo what's the last single player game you finished completed finished like Pikmin when you

more General person that existed before gotta gaming was popular and this format of gaming where you pay massive amounts of money for chances at getting items that's what it is yeah is is insane because it's not even it's it's a step down from it it is worse to be hooked on this than it is to have an actual gambling addiction at a casino you have better odds at actual casinos that's TI this this devolve it's like a form of gaming that should be it would be like being addicted to like DraftKings except worse it's it's it's worse than that I I I I didn't know enough about gacha before this
