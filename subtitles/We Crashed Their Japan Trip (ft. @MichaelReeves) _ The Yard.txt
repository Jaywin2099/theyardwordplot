 Michael's Thorn is while we are riding he does this thing sometimes bro go and then stop communicating dude that's crazy bro are you Michael Yo are you Lwig what the Bro are you Lwig bro can I get an autograph dude dude you look good bro can I get in here are you a Red Bull athlete [Music] short how do you say that in Japanese uh shan And that's seven syllables. Mhm. You really drag it out. You can't just say hot. You guys shouldn't be this country. You shouldn't be talking. You shouldn't be talking. We were supposed to be here. It's another little love story. And this time he brought an awesome friend. We like more. I don't like seeing other people in this country. It freaks me out. You don't like seeing other Oh, other guy. Other people I know. Yeah. Yeah. Like it ruins the immersion. Yeah. Get out of my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Out of my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Get out of my coonie. We're going to say that. Do you know what [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is? I mean, I I wouldn't like anyone in it. Sounds like something I'd like to keep people out. Someone's in there and I don't like that. Thank you. So, you understand how we feel now? I saw I we were honked at by a white man driving a truck. Some dude who's just obviously not like honked in an aggressive way. No, no, he honked and waved, but he was in like a work truck and he's like I guess he's just shouting us out. He's just happy to see a white too long. We We definitely had a period where we were yearning for whites. Excuse me. Okay. It was when we were trying to communicate and we were trying to find one white person to help us with directions. Maybe English speakers have better words. I don't know how is there another term for that. That's crazy. And you're wearing a Red Bull. noise. What do you guys call them in this country? Noise. Uh but then it turns out that um English speakers uh suck to talk to. Yeah, they blow ass. They don't know anything about this country. They don't know anything about this country even a little bit at all. It sounds like you found someone who spoke English and then they didn't give you any helpful directions. Is that what happened? That's about Did they say like, "I love uh I'm so happy to see you because I love Lewig content. I love Michael R's content." Uh did they recognize you in Osaka? Yeah, really in Osaka. Yeah, there there's people who be like, he got Funko Pops of him, bro. He got that sweet Funko Pop. He's got that He's got that Mono Pop money. I don't Lewig Lewig has to do this before he gets back for his big sponsorship thing. I don't even know if I can say it, but he's got to get back. And I realized he's got the sweetest monkey for these brands. It's so sweet. And and then he kept talking about how do you say how do you hear me? This is what What do you think, by the way? What do you think he's been doing since he got to Japan? I think he goes I think he goes sodas and he bows at random Japanese people. I don't I think that's that was season one of Slime in Japan. Season two of Slime in Japan was him walking into the airport and walking around like this going uh head so good she honor roll. Head so good she honor roll straight into ride the dick like a carnival. I done did the impossible. Did you just find out about this album? No, you're just rocking to Kanye now. Kanye just find out. You just you I knew how TikTok RZ party and I'm bringing the RZ party to Japan. And then more recently, more recently, as of maybe this morning, he's been saying, "How do you think they say sweet monkey?" Michael can get close on that one. You know sweet, right? Yeah. A monkey. At least 50%. If there's ever a Japanese brand working with Lewig and they know he's like brand safe and like can yield a high level of interaction and stuff, they're saying that Lwig. Yeah. Welcome to episode 100. We're in Japan. You guys scared us last night. I don't know if that's rolling before this when I'll Yeah. Yeah. You guys did seem a little shocked. I didn't like it. I think it was just the shock of seeing someone I know and after seeing like almost no one I know for a full week straight. The guy the guy you did actually scare you do you don't want to see in the country. Aiden you to be fair went to the side of the road and went hey and you scared the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of me cuz I didn't realize you were a human I knew. I thought like my tires had both blown out and I was like just going Michael's just getting dragged behind you just like our Well, we were worried that you might just cruise on by us and uh Slime's Slime's uh way of saving this situation was to jump out into traffic with his bald head, which and it did work. And it did work the one time, right? I didn't like it, but it worked. Did he jump out in front of you? You were first. And I jumped down in front of me. Yeah, I jumped down in front of you. And remember I touched your face? I I reached through your helmet and touched your face and said, "I love I love YouTube." I love you, my sweet monkey. You're my sweet monkey. I'm your Yojimbo now. You are my Yojimbo. I watched that on a plane. What? Final 10. Yojimbo. What? Michael, what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is he saying to me? He's saying he's saying Yimbo. He has he been a pain in the ass to you this whole trip? He's been saying a lot of weird things to me in the helmet and after he stops recording the mics. Um, what in the helmet? Dude, there's the pack so much in that damn helmet. A lot of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Thank god they don't record. Just me and Michael for some straight horrible stream of consciousness [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] And like if that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] got recorded, he wouldn't be he wouldn't have to go home for a sponsorship. We could stay in Japan probably forever. We're we're day nine. You have to understand this. We're day nine traveling across Japan without a map and and we spent every day talking to each other for probably like 16 hours a day and it's just a two-way between you guys in the helmet. Just the two of us and so Oh yeah, cuz cuz the RV isn't close enough to be on the comms with you, right? Yeah, it's way far away. They're far away. We don't know where they are until the end of the day where they appear and they're like, "Hi." In the Pikmin onion and you just go into it and Yeah. And and so it's me and Michael and and we're just saying stupid [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and then when there's a silence we go and we just doing that. We're we're brain rotting ourselves. Yeah. So you guys get mad at me. Sorry this I'm going to air grievance with them. You're great. But they get mad at me. I come I get off the plane. I start I start telling Yingling that he's a chopped h. I get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yelled at by people and it's annoy. And you guys have the same brain rod. I just you just I accelerate faster. I have a faster seat than you than you. There's a safe place in the helmet. Oh, so so we're saying in the airport I can't be calling you the chops. Yeah, cuz we don't walk into Lawson's and go back up. When I say it, all I imagine is Cam editing for 16 hours a day in that RV and sifting through like 9 hours of us going and he has to like get through it in case there's like a little chunk of good dialogue. Guys, tomorrow maybe 100 less gigabytes of that cuz we just have to delete all of it. We've been on our own journey with this because me and Slime have Do Do you guys know what what the HU's are? Yeah, we know what the Huz are. Yeah. Well, then by extension with the chopped huzzo hus. We have been I we have been calling Nick Yling the chopped huzz in Japanese for maybe 3 days straight. You know how to say the chopped hus in Japanese. But we say it as if we're like a salary man. Imagine this. Are you just using a racist voice? No. No. Imagine you're a salary and you and you show up and there's because you're you're a entertaining a client. You have a beautiful bevy of 100 prostitutes and they're waiting in the big giant hotel room and you're and you're entertaining and you open the door and you hit the key card, you're drunk. You're like and you open it. Nick Gingling's there. Yeah, that's the chopped hus. That would be chopped hopped hus. Yeah, you guys are on the same wavelength, but it's cuz it's basically been just us three together, either walking or in a hotel room. So, we're we're in the same we're on the same trajectory. Oh my god, I saw Aiden's balls for the first time. How was that? They're movie balls. Like, perfect. He has movie balls. There's a video on Anony's phone cuz we we got into the hotel room and the bathroom is very nice, but it's all like one of those open all glass ones. So, we're like, "Oh my god, you can just see each other's shower." Like, what are we going to do? Turns out it has uh like blinds that will close if you push a button, right? Wooden blinds. But they go down like really slowly and up really slowly. So when I was in there, I I go into the bathroom and I stand on top of the bathtub like mount it like this and I I tell Anthony to raise the blinds and I'm holding and it slowly reveals my balls in the window. You're doing like a movie theater curtain reveal of your balls. So long. It's abid. It's my balls. But the payoff was good cuz it was a movie balls. They were movie balls. It was crazy. I didn't know you had those. I got prosthetic movie balls cuz he has movie balls. if you've seen his ballsurgery balls. I thought you pointed at Michael and I was like, "You've seen Michael's movie." Michael's balls. I'm sure they're great, but they know who they are. I think it's interesting. So, for cuz I feel like as somebody who might be watching the the videos that you put out or maybe even watching this podcast, they probably think, you know, of course they plan to meet up with each other, but we really did just find you in the street last night. Yeah, that was really scary. I'm sorry, brother. Did you communicate with Dan? Was that it? No, not really. I mean, we we have been talking to Dan, but he didn't do anything to like assist. What instructions did you get? How did you do that? We we saw that you GPS tracker we saw that you were following a certain road like a really long time. And that road, if you followed it into Tokyo, ended in an area that was near our hotel. So, uh, we just timed when you would follow that. Talking about thei the Is that the Oh, yeah. Yeah, the one the mei or there's the meati. If they don't understand, we go to the easy mei easy. I I can see it. I can see your mind unra unspooling as we speak. We're learning. We're learning so much. And then we just hired uh we couldn't Turns out we couldn't rent a car here. I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that up. Uh why can't you? Uh you need a special driver's permit that takes like you need to get in the US. They knew we were transport not an international license. It is driver. You have to. But you I've rented cars in other countries. I've rented cars in other countries before and you didn't need it. The process for this is so good. Do you want to hear the process for an international license? You send the application. You wait three business days and you get it. Michael, tell them. You uh you go to your local AAA branch, you pay $20 and wait 15 minutes and you have it. Wait, what? They'll take one picture of you and they'll but they will charge you $5 extra dollars for the picture. Said 3 days online. No, they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lied. You could have just gone. You could have just got it. You get a day off. You get it. They hand it to you. You could get it the morning of your flight. I'm convinced people in Japan have no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] clue what this permanent cuz it looks good and it looks official. But they have no idea it's the equivalent of like going to a gas station and asking for it in the US. Look at that. That's it. Yeah, that's it. That's so funny. Mine's also beat to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Dude, it is beat. I So, we ended up not getting a car and we just took a taxi out here. So, he dropped us off on the side of the road and like basically ruins Japan. There is literally a cow barn right over behind the shop right now. Smells so bad. And it smells really bad. And now to get back, we have to walk uh we have to walk from here cuz you can't call a car out here. We have to walk an hour to a station and then uh take it back to Tokyo. These things never produced again. Oh no. The chops has another problem with us, bro. I don't want to hear it. Also, he was mad at you. Me? What are you mad at me for? Always some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you. He's a liar, bro. We were We were talking about how if we weren't if we weren't the Chopped Hushu would have gotten here earlier, but because And it's our fault for being the Chopped Hus. Yeah, cuz you guys are beat. Yeah. Beat Chopped. And if we weren't beat, you would have been here. No, I can tell you what has happened every day. It is the journey of my motorcycle keys. The keys? Yeah. Yeah. The long awaited journey of motorcycle keys. I lose it every day or I keep it in my bike with my bike still turned on and the blinker on. Always the I have probably I think unironically about two hours of footage of his blinker just on like small clips. Why? So maybe a hundred times. I keep pulling into places and I put down my kickstand and I just hop off and I go okay triangle and now it's time to go into the building. Yeah. I and I've it's bad enough that like we were eating at a place like a biker bar with several motorcycles and the owners are motorcycle drivers. They have an oldfashioned like 1976 motorcycle and then they're ser [Music] and I'm like what? And I'm like and all I heard is binka and I was like oh I know this is and she's like she's basically [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kindly being like yeah dumbass. Why why are you guys doing this? I know why he's doing it. Cuz he's like an eternal weeb that will never truly be whole. But you seem more on the ball, Michael. No, this is for the love of the game. I I' I've been wanting to rent a Japan motorcycle for like 4 years. And every time I go into the little motorcycle shop, I say, "Oh," and they and the nice little man in there goes, he says, "No." He actually [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] looks at me in the face and he goes, "Not for you, dude." Yeah. It was It's not like not today or like we're booked out. He goes, "No." And I'm like, "I got the international license." No. So, uh, this is a good opportunity to do it. I've always wanted to do it. Um, I think this is also your idea. One of our idea. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I think like this is not my idea. The like initial start was like, I wish I could ride a motorcycle across Japan. And you said, we'll we could do that. We could do that. We could take it way too seriously. That was one of the things that should have stayed in the head. I said I said, let's take it really seriously and make a challenge out of it and also [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] suffer. Seriously. And also the RV follows us for six days out of the week and then they make the videos and uh Cam dies an early death. Cam is going to die an early death. We've heard he is suffering. Um yeah, but he get to eat the 7-Eleven rice balls. That's the the trade-off. That's Dude, it's sad. So yeah, the RV is following us in editing and Cam gets the footage every day. He's he's gotten two out. Hell yeah. But I saw him last night. He looked what? Like death. Just gaunt. Just gaunt. And uh you turned Cam into the chopped hugs. I did turn into the chopped hugs. And I we were I was I forget when but I was talking to him cuz we passed Fuji. Yeah. And I was like, "Do you see Fuji?" Wasn't it beautiful? He was like, "I didn't see it, man." He said, "I took a peek out the window a little bit, but not really." Like it's there in your vision for like 5 hours. Yeah, it is. It is because it's a big mountain. It doesn't move. Beautiful. But yeah, to go back, this is Michael's idea to the point where the only reason I got a motorcycle in the first place is because of Michael to practice for this. Oh yeah, the motorcycle at home is his practice girl. Yeah, his first love and this is the real deal. What are what are kind of the uh the the rose stem and the thorns of the trip so far? Can you can you see Aiden in that camera? You should sit up. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] There's a bush, bro. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Yeah, I got a bush. What of it, dude? Get the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. Also, Michael, not even 4 days ago said, "I hate rose bud thorn." In a total sever conversation. No, no, no. This is different. It's the rose, the thorn, and the stem. What's the stem? Cuz bud I don't like bud. Bud's annoying. Bud's like, "What are you looking forward to? I I don't care." What is stem? I want the middle part of the trip. Arguably, arguably the most important question. Middle end of your trip. I want to know I want to know what's the most like middle point of this trip element of it. I'll let I'll let you Well, I'll let you rip a thorn porn. Riding uh motorcycles through Osaka, which is like one of the most fun cities to go to when you're not on a motorcycle. But we I think that was the biggest time sync of the entire trip was we parked our motorcycles. Led goes, "Okay, floor six, row F. We got it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] down." And then we walk away and take a train somewhere else and we come back and we go where the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are the motorcycles? And we looked for maybe two and a half or three hours for the motorcycles. Like you just forgot or like it's impossible or it's just difficult to find. It's difficult to find because the elevator to get to where we needed to go is through what seems like an employee entrance. Yeah, it really was. Yeah, we walked past like lockers and stuff. Uh but didn't make a note of it as we're going out. Yeah, it's like some back rooms entrance. So that dude that Oaka day I think it'll be out by the time this is out. It was horrible cuz we had we had I don't know if you've seen the first episode. Yeah. Yling watched it. He watches all your slop. We didn't make a lot of progress. No. Don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] say that so excitedly. You didn't make a lot of progress. Jump in like that. I think you've made up for it recently. Uh well, we have This is a slow start. We We have I'll I'll I'll leak for you, but we have an insane skip. Yeah, huge skip. We did. We did a swag fairy skip. What? What? It was really There's a fairy which whose mouth opens like a jar in a cave. You used a whistle, bro. What's the whistle? You use a whistle to get to the third whistle to get to the next world. What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is the whistle? You ever play Super Mario Bros.? No. Like OG? No. You found a whistle? You found You found a fairy. I don't do that. I jerk off to porn and play cool video games. Yeah. Anyways, we Has he dumped out real quick? Has he dumped his balls out? I don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] know. I know. I'll tell you the schedule. The schedule is he leaves every morning for breakfast. I jerk it and then he [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and then we get going on the road. I don't know if he does it at breakfast. Yeah. Yeah. Cuz that's your time in the There's been on our trip there's been a lot of heavy accusations of who's drained their balls recently. How long have you been here? It's been my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hours. 48 hours. Two days. This is three day. This is day three. This is day three. Okay. So, you're at like 60 hours right now. Yeah. Okay. So, we've got a few ball drains on. It's just I thought you were like 24 hours in like, "All right, got a drain." I'd be in the hotel room like reading a book cuz they went to go do something and it comes back and Yinglings. It's like this guy's balls look empty and I like have to just I would say, "No, my balls aren't empty." And then they just don't believe me. But I don't have movie balls, so they look the same no matter what. Okay. So that Osaka was the worst part of the trip so far, but you found a you found a cool skip. What has there been a maybe a best part of the trip so far? Uh it is it's hard to say who, but it is generally the people. Yeah, we have met along the freaking way. It seems like everybody's been really kind. The night and magical and spiritual, too. This one man [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I think I think OG. Ojisan is probably like OG. That's how he refer to himself. That's not He's a OG song. You're like my fault. My fault. We were uh Where was this? This isn't a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] This is early. This is after the fairy ride. If that's the place that we went to after the fairy ride in the hill. Soon. That was cool. We met this man who was walking by, brushed us off like the white gajun we are, but then he saw Lewis do hat. He said, "Oh, that's awesome." He had this newspaper and he goes, "Joy." And I and then I try to make conversation. I'm like, "Uh, when's the game?" He flips through for maybe three minutes. Can't find it. And then he goes, "Yamoto." Who's the other pitcher? Japanese. The other Did you just start miming baseball actions to like connect with him? He did. He did. He's like 70 years old and he had like a bamboo walking stick and he goes, "It's a good stick. He had a good stick. Good stick. I got a good stick." Uh and then we he told us like what we need to do to like continue on in our journey and then he also uh he was like yeah OG son 40 years ago walked this path and it's like the one we were driving. Yeah. I was like damn OG song you're that guy. He said that was crazy. How many hours did that take? He said hours. And then he said 50 days. I said whoa. Some biblical [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] That's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] He walked for 40 days and 40 nights with nothing but a he shot gamerhood right after it too. and he did shoot Safe Farm Gamerhood Nepone desk edition. Uh yeah, so it's definitely the people there's like there's a there's a running list. There's like 10 or so people we've met that have left impressions. Do you think they consider you as brand safe as State Farm might? The Japanese people. Yes, on the whole. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cuz I don't know how to be crass in their language. You didn't learn any awesome words. There's not that many. I really tried to test chat GPT. I was like, "Give me some slurs. Give me Give me something. Give me something to work with." And JP's like, "We don't got that. I don't I don't can't I can't do that for you." I know, uh, there's a way to say, "I should kill myself." That's a good idea. I learned from a man in a bar how to say, "Come inside, please." Dude, that was a good one. And not and not like come inside of a building. I think it's context. It could be. Well, no, it's it's burst inside. Please. I don't think I I actually don't think it's context. You never burst into a room before. Wait. Whoa. Uh yeah. He also knows uh I got to I'm going to make piss. Michael knows the crash things. I'm going to create piss. Yeah. That's so elegant. Yeah. It's like I'm going to create piss. That that gets him half the time. Sometimes they question it and sometimes they laugh really hard. That's the thing. We we we have the same like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] We're like parrots, you know? We just throw the same [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out there. But it's weird because sometimes it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lands. Like it super lands and sometimes they just walk away from you and sometimes they really just don't register it. It's just like we have a few ults and sometimes the alt is good, sometimes got merk treads. So but your ults is just at the a lull in the conversation and you just say burst in me. Uh no no ours are the guy at 7-Eleven just like ah there's a line. Some some lady has like graciously drawn you a map of where to go from the 7-Eleven bursting me. No, we don't do that. At my I look at Michael, I go I'm going to and I go back and that means I'm traveling across all of Japan on bike. Got it. And then they go either or they go Yeah. don't care, dude. Where we're staying is so cringe. Aiden Aiden [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me. He holds me down. He [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me like a dog every time we go on a trip, bro. Premium economy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me like a dog. We come to this hotel that he booked. Everyone at this hotel is deadass. Like a guy Jind. Everyone like I walk by and there's like a 70-year-old white man and I'm like he he probably invented some medical app. Guy who thinks hotels in Tokyo are filled with local Japanese people. Yeah, you're in [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Tokyo. You're We're We're not just in Tokyo. We are like in the We literally You throw a dart at the bullseye of Tokyo, dude. Get this. Okay, this is the problem. This is the problem. He's been on this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] One one he could have booked the hotel, but two two this is the worst part. This is the worst part. He keeps talking about how we need to we should have been in Rapangi instead, which is contextually is like Beverly Hills in Tokyo and also filled with white people. I didn't know. Last time we were in Rapon, I didn't see a single [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] white person except for your own hotel room the whole time. It was filled with white people. Well, uh, to defend slime for a second, you're not exactly great at travel. Come on. I told you he holds you down, he [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you. You're not exactly great at it. I'm Some say I'm the greatest. Some have called you the goat, but I think that's revoked for years now cuz for years. Well, okay, if you don't know, I uh I was supposed to get to Japan a bit earlier and meet up with Connor and we're going to have a nice dinner and I had it planned. We were going to go. It was a great spot and I get to the airport and I'm at the desk and then I'm like, "Yo, Yingling, do you have my check-in information?" Cuz I'm not allowed to buy flights. I should preface that cuz I don't get a company card. I don't get a company card of my own. Company card is your company card has nothing to do with this. Well, oh, should I have paid with my personal for this business trip? That's exa. Sure. And then reimburse it. You do that either. Well, you're a millionaire. Let me tell you, there's a lot of reimbursements coming. But yeah, we uh uh I get there and uh and Aiden never booked the flight. Never [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] booked it. We pulled it up on his computer. He never [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] booked it. And so I just Is that true? Is that Did it really happen that way? Dude, it's so bad because I I was I was so heartbroken because And I truly deserved it. I truly deserved it. I I want to say this ended up working out well in that you got put on the flight you originally wanted anyway, which is true, but in some ways it's better. Actually, you you should be happy. You should be happy. No, I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up and things might come up for during the 90minute sitcom that we went through to book your flight at the office. And I I said repeatedly, I'm the goat of booking flights. And and the reason I said this is I think since I was like 16, I have a record of every flight I've ever booked for myself and other people. And I always list the confirmation, the flight info, and I record it in like a self message log so I cannot lose that number uh for like check-in and stuff. And I can see the record of like where I've flown. And this is no joke the first time I haven't done it in 10 years. And I did it for Lewig's trip to Japan. And I felt so bad. And I I I think I have lost my title. You lost your title. You only need one. There's only one terrorist attack in New York. We'll never forget that. And I'll never forget this. See, that's the thing. The World Trade Center was attacked like 10 years before that, too. Yeah. No one knows about that. No one attack. There was a van. That's right, Michael. Let me tell you about this. There was there was a van and everyone knows about it, but many people forgot. Can I can I ask you realistically with where you guys are at right now? Cuz you guys made up a lot of progress. Mhm. Like the the trip, my understanding is start of the trip was a little slow, mostly because of weather, and then it's picked up a lot since then. So, do you guys think you're going to make it all the way to the end right now? No. Oh, the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I thought we were asking opinions. I'm sorry. I thought that should have stayed in the podcast. I thought we were sharing. That should have stayed in the back. He said no. Thought we were sharing. I think yes. You think But he thinks no. Actually, today's going to be huge. Today's going to be a massively influential day cuz I think it's the last day until we get hit with the shittest weather. Yeah. So, I was at breakfast this morning and I saw a like weather report on the TV and it was just like seven days and then every region and then it was like today beautiful, sunny, tomorrow like cloudy and then it's like rain, rain, rain, snow, rain, rain. So, it's just really hard to drive long distances in that weather with any success. I think about dying more. Is it harder to see? Are you just cold? Are you soaked? Like all the above. All the above. And you go slower cuz you don't want to die. You think about death a lot more. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. You think about death constantly because every turns could slip out from under we would paint the road and our blood would mix and make a new color. Yeah. Like a like cherry coke. No. I've been thinking about death a lot on this trip because I turned 30. Oh yeah. You turned 30 on this trip. You turned 30 years old. I didn't realize you were. Wait. No. You I'm sorry. You're lying to me. He's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 28. I turned 30 years old. He's spiritually 30. He's spiritually more bald than I am. I've been thinking about death. Real real. That's real. It was a hat. I'm not wearing a hat. I found a good stick. I'm a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fountain of youth, you old [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Look at you. But yeah, we're we're feeling cross about it. What What do I have? No hair. I thought there was a bug on me. I thought there was a bug on me. He was trying to get it cuz he he got some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on me earlier, but it was just my bald head. I was drawn to it like a moth flame. You were like the orb. Yeah, I was trying to counsel with it to see if our trip will go well. Yeah. Well, you know what? It says you're not says you're going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] die. It says you're going to die. You're going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] die. Yay. Yeah, I think we'll make it. But it'll be tough after after this, you know, being locked in the in the uh helmet headphones for this long with each other and spending every night together in every hotel. Mhm. Hotel room. Uh would you go on another trip like this again right now? Yeah, we already talked about a couple. Yeah. I was like, "Hell hell yeah." I was like, "Hell yeah." It's pretty bad, dude. Sometimes I go to the bathroom and I talk out loud. I talked about this last night and I think I'm in the helmet and I think he can hear me and then I go, "Nope, dude." Well, it's a schizophrenia started already. Schizophrenia, but the voice in your head is blood waves for the rest of your life. Only that. I got Okay, how about Rose? No, bud. Rose and Thorn of each other cuz you've been spending so many quarters together. You've been inside each other's mind palaces while you travel. What's start with you, Michael. What's the worst [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about traveling with him for so long? I mean, mostly it's pretty good. Like, generally, it's good. Like, he's really on top of things. Uh, good at directions. Bad. I mean, his opinions on Japanese people, you would think. Generally, as a race, um, haven't been great. I don't know. I don't know what he's referring to. I don't know what he's referring to. Kind of like a touchy subject. And it must come up a lot because you're in Japan. Constantly. Constantly. He learns the homogeneous society is succeeding for some reasons and we should perhaps discuss them. He's he's driving during the day one like, "Wow, the streets are so clean here." H Oh, wow. There's no homeless people. Curious. A denser city than any in America, but no homeless. Curious. Uh I got no thorns. No thorns. Don't be a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] liar. I mean, we're getting along really well. I won't lie to you. No, it's been pretty good. Well, the thorns. Thorns. thorns. Uh, if it's love, it's love. Uh, yeah, it's love. It's love. He's We're uh, no matter what decision he makes, it's always confident. So, I don't know which ones he's feeling bad about, but tell me about it. So [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] He says, "Left turn here." And I go, "I don't know." He goes, "Let turn here, left turn here." And I, it's wrong. We went the wrong way. I do rip every decision quite confidently. And I'm wrong a good amount of the time. But here's the thing. That's bad for directions. really good for conversation with Japanese people. As long as you just say some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you go they're okay. They get it. They just go off of your vibe. I don't think that any of them know how to speak Japanese. So, he's aura farming. The whole country is not actually communicating with each other. Vive based. It's just vibes. No, cuz I mean the whole like Japanese uh like listening sounds like they go deep. I don't know if you've spoken to a Japanese person since you've been here. Yeah. Yeah. You sound to be in this hotel for a while. We have been using a surprising amount of Japanese in Dude, we taught we taught Yingling a word. He's been saying saying thank you to everyone. I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] foot. See, he's embarrassed. That's a problem. I said, "Don't be embarrassed." Well, cuz you your your camera broke, right? So, we we picked up a new camera for Michael in Tokyo. And we had a whole We No, we had a whole I don't like this. Don't be on their team. You're supposed to be on my team. Don't be on the pack. Let me get in there. We We had a whole We We used I cheated, you know. I used chat GBT in advance to like basically memorize some phrases. But what a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] treat. What a treat. And then I know enough Japanese from college that I can like piece together some things. So, we had a whole conversation with the guy that we bought the camera from, and that was fun. I I uh we've been missing that because we can't improve outside of the phone. Yes. Yeah. No. Can you Yeah, I guess we haven't talked about it. What are all the rules for your trip? Oh, right. No map, no expressways, no poll roads. Yeah. Uh no cell phone other than Yeah. No, no, no. Like smartphone. No smartphone usage other than to uh like record video. Yeah. And then we do listen to Spotify while we ride. Yeah. Cuz I can't be alone with my thoughts. It would be scary for that long. So is it like you're listening to like the new Cardi album and then you hear Lwig come on over the intercom. That's pretty much exactly what happened. One time I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] let I was watching try to watch episode one before I realized there are 15 maps in it in the first 5 seconds. I just realized Michael's Thorn. Yeah. Yeah. Michael Thorne is while we are riding he does this thing sometimes. go and then stop communicating. Dude, that's crazy. And he's behind you, right? He's behind me and and then and then I'm like, that is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. And then I'll be like, Michael and like, yeah, what's up? Okay, cool. Sorry, I just thought you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] died in his accent. Funny. That's what I think. Oh, and oh god, one more thorn. He does this thing and I don't know how to stop it. Like for example, we were on a ferry a ferry and it over it's like night. It's it's like five stories tall. It overlooks the ocean and he's going over and he goes, "Yeah, it's my favorite. I put a little foot over it and he puts a little foot and he like he gets like really dangerous with it and I it's like I don't want to be like yeah to encourage it and if I say no, it also feeds in. There's no way out of the genjutsu. I I think unfortunately Michael and I are very similar. I did this the other night going to you guys to to the corner been doing it so much. There's this big like river. I can't swim. It's not a river, bro. It is, by the way, it's the moat for the emperor's palace. It's the moat for the emperor's palace to keep out the enemies of the emperor. And we're walking along it and I called Yingling the Chopas. And then he'll get mad cuz I've been saying it too much. And so I start defending Yingling. And so I just fine, I guess I'll just go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] jump. I guess I'll go to the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] water. And I like I would like put my foot over. If I fall, I probably drown. And they're like, and they're like, "No, no, no, no, no." And it feels really good when they say no cuz you're making them do something. And if they encourage you, you just Yeah. You're changing the world. I do it to Lily all the time. And I was kind of doing it on camera to be like, "Haha, this is going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with Lily." But then Lwig as filming goes, "No, no, no." Like that's good. That's good to know. You've shown me a weakness and I'm going to I'm going to run with it for the rest of the trip. It is my greatest weakness. And he likes to take advantage. Yeah. I love that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Uh but his greatest strength is he is way more resourceful uh than you. Oh like might be a surprise but he's a little more resourceful than my ass. Interesting. Uh cuz we had a we had a a couple of motorcycle disasters. We had a bike tip which you can see on episode one of the tip to tip Japan trip on YouTube out now. Now um what happens when the bike tip's over? I never ridden that ridden motor. I know it falls, but like does the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] break or does like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] It depends on the bike. It could I mean these I think it's normally designed so it's like hopefully it doesn't anything [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. It just broke the handguard and twisted his mirror and a little bit of liquid came out which was scary and then it wouldn't start. We freaked out. The engine flooded. It's just everything that stopped it from moving. I guess these are kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bikes. I was surprised when we stopped you guys in the street. I thought they'd be like some rinky dink like little Suzukis or something, but these are kind of like kind of badass. They are pretty freaking sweet except for when they're on the ground. Yep. Which we don't love to see and they don't start. I got a flat tire yesterday. How's that? The day before. Oh, is that when you were at the the shop? The shop? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Cuz we we saw on the tracker you guys were at a bike shop. It was the day before that. Got the flat and then I patched it up and then filled it at the gas station. But then it's like you shouldn't go on like the flat. Yeah. Yeah. But his patch was great. Does he know how to do that shitac there? [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] no now. Yeah. Yeah, I saw it. Real world trip. Good way to learn. It was way too fast. It was so It's scary how little goes into a lot of ooze. Not a lot of no ooze at all. Actually, it's just a little strip. But like on a trip where you can't Google it. Yeah. Oh yeah. That's what I mean. Like I could do it if I could Google it. But Michael not only didn't need to Google it, he also had all the gear to fix it. Oh, bing bong. You bring like tools. Yeah. I brought like a tiny pack of tools like in case something horrendous happens. two-stroke motor oil. Two-stroke motor oil, gasoline. Is that like the worst thing that's happened on the trip like in to our bikes? I I I guess cuz besides maybe losing the bikes in Osaka. I think that uh No. Worst thing that happened on this trip was the dinner on the second day where we pulled up on the bikes and then ordered a beer and she said, "Are you sure, dude?" Oh my god. We ordered two beers, but then she said, "Is she said?" And sometimes people say that because they're like, "Oh, that's cool. White people on motorcycles." He and my sweet little monkeys. And then then she goes, "Oh, but it's like, are you okay to drink and then ride your motorcycle?" And then the entire restaurant went very quiet and heard the entire interaction. And I had no other word. I said, and so she was like, "Are you okay? You're going to ride motorcycle. It's okay to drink." I said, "It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. I'm a pro at this. Josu drink all the time. It was like a 2hour long 2 and 1 half hour long dinner and I will say I took maybe two sips but then after the conversation I was like I'm not drinking the rest of I I I will not consume the beer. Dude, it was cuz we were literally sitting there at this. It's like yaki niku. It's like you cook your own meat. Yeah. Small style. And we the menu is all in Japanese so we didn't know what to order. So I was like I have a strat. We'll order two beers when she comes and it'll stall for time. And that's why we did it in the first place. Yeah. Not even really to drink them. And then dude, it was so awkward after that. That was tough. It was rough. It It started out bad and got worse. I was like, "Could I have this?" And the lady went in the back. She said, "We don't have this." And I know Japan's alcohol limit is lower in the States. I think it's 003. Yeah. But we're not going to hit that. We're not especially after 2 hours of yaki niku. But uh have you guys camped yet? Have we camping? Oh wow. Have we Oh no. Hello princess. A princess pillow. I am not a pillow princess. I like the bean pillow. Okay. No. And what what has happened is every day I'm like Michael's like Michael wants to camp bed. I'll camp right here. Yeah. Right. I was thinking too. Here's the issue. We drive. We eat lunch. We have a nice lunch. We drive. We eat dinner. We have a nice dinner. We drive. Dark out. It is really hard to find a camping spot when it's dark out because private land or just like somewhere you can't camp because it's wet or soggy. You can't like get a lay of the land and you can't look it up. You can't look up where to camp or camping ground camping. You don't understand the way our ancestors did this, bro. You just lay down. What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] That is not how it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] worked even a little bit. Are you kidding me? They just lay down. That's what we did for thousands of years. like really long ago. I guess that's what we're kind of doing now. Yeah, this is private land, right? I don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] know. What is he doing? This is Dude, the conversation is making me really nervous. Hey, it's all right. We fight. We fight. I want to camp. He's never hurt me. I've hurt him many times. He starts acting up. I want to camp. And I And you know what? We tried one night with some good effort. Michael was like, "I want to camp at Fuji." And I was like, "Let's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do it. And that was a good idea. We had like a nice picnic with Fuji in our background and he's like, "Yeah, this would be sick." So we So we start driving towards Fuji, but when it's dark out, you can't see it anymore. Sure. So we don't know how to get there. And everything within about 50 square miles of Fuji is called Fuji. It's like Fuji. Very unhelpful. The word Fuji Nobashi, Fuji City. This town is named Oyama, which means the mountain. And we asked the guy, "Where's the mountain?" He said, "No mountain in the sid town at the check-in." No mountain. They just named some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] We just thought about a mountain when we when we landed here. So, we went to the convenience store and asked the lady in the town called Fuji. We said, "Hey, how do we get to Mount Fuji?" And she said, "You want to get to Mount Fuji?" [Music] What? What do you mean? Yeah. Like, how could you say that? So, that's what we did. We went that way and then we just ended up scaling a mountain like probably climbing 1,000 m of altitude from sea level. Yeah, we got real cold and it it dropped to 3 C. Oh, and and it's and we went through this patch of woods. I was terrified. I was so down at camping. I'm behind Michael. I'm like And Michael yearns for the void. Yes. It like fuels him. Me, it terrifies me. This is so new. Well, no. He's always boasted that he doesn't fear death. But it's not death. It is yo-kai. Yo-kai. Pakimo. Yokai. Demons and monsters. Aha. Nani. Nani. Yo-kai. Nani. Yokai. Deskai. What is it? Shoy. Baka yokai. Droy yokai. Yokai. Yo-kai is uh ghosts. Demons. Yeah, demons. It's like the I believe it's demons. Yeah, there's another word for ghost. And you yearn for the for the Yo-kai. I just want to go in the dark woods and where there's no one around and probably do more of the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that I was doing on the boat. Honestly, I was thinking last night I was like, I wish I could hide behind a tree and just sc losing in the dark woods screaming in the distance. I don't know, Michael. We should probably go to this hotel route in it seems pretty safe. But tonight though, tonight I think is a camping night. I I think we go into the darkness and then just find a place like this. This is a beautiful little camp spot if we can find but like do you know how hard this was to find without I could be harder. Okay. Okay. This way. What do you mean hard to find? We found this spot on accident to be honest. We found this spot in the daytime on accident, but finding this at night would be very hard. You just go where bridges are. Bridges are your your your uh lighthouse. Isn't that also tough though to know what a bridge is? So pillow bridge. Oh, it's a nice white. Yeah, he needs he needs a little bit of quiet time and a little bit of phone time. He just wants to have phone time. He just wants to starfish and that's fine. We don't have phone time. And Michael has been like writing down YouTube shorts he wants to see when he gets out. Just imagining them. Yeah. He's telling about this Konichi warts guy who just goes up to people in Tokyo and says, "Can you hold the phone?" And then he goes, "Konichi warts." I'm like, "I need to see it. That sounds so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] The mythology in your head is just growing and growing." Great expectations. taking taking Nick Engling on this trip. This is his first time in Japan and in Tokyo and he's been I I think he's being uh maybe radicalized about like urbanization and stuff. No. All maybe dude no because he was we were talking with him in the in the restaurant and I I was like trying to compare everything to Phoenix, Arizona and he was like he was basically saying young boy better like Phoenix, Arizona better. And me and Aiden are trying to explain to him why Phoenix is like an accident that should not exist. Phoenix, Arizona should not event. I have some I have some Nick Yingling quotes while he's been walking around Japan with me. I wrote it down. That's fine. Uh number one, I'm not the chopped hus. I'm not the chopped h said that many times. Have you said that? He said he said it. Uh it'd be so nice if we just had big ass buildings like this that were just housing. Why don't we have that? And so one of my one of my favorites from yesterday, why is Japan chill with us? Didn't we nuke them twice? I wouldn't be chill. And no, no, he did. Problem is he confirmed one already. And then he said, I wouldn't be chill if that happened to me. Interested a lot. You know what? Nick, it's a very fair thought. and brings up an interesting history and you you might you might realize that Japan has no formal military and there's a big occupation. My third my third one was was when we got out of the city he said this looks like Arizona. That was that was crazy. The Phoenix thing was real though cuz we were just trying to explain it and we were like again would you would you move to like I don't know. Would you move to Tijuan? He's like no. I was like okay what about like Canada? He's like maybe I don't know. We've been torturing him. Yeah. We've been merciless on this trip. I can't lie. Poor guy. Why are you doing this to him? Because he got to come on points. I love doing I love doing stuff that just pushes them over the edge because we when we've been walking through Tokyo I'm you guys have probably noticed this too. Show is on [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] everything here. One in one in two chance if it's a man it's show time. Yeah on in he is in every advertisement for every product imaginable. They got the Dodgers branded prime drinks at this gas station. Yeah. It's crazy cuz he hasn't been to Tokyo before. I'm like oh well he said should see like the the big famous parts of the city, right? So the first day we got here, we walked to Shinjuku and there's a big, you know, massive wall advertisement on the side of a building that has Shi in it. And it's kind of it reminds me of that massive mural that there is in downtown LA with him like painted on it. And uh I'm just I'm just thinking of whatever I can to annoy Yingling. And I look up at this is like it's crazy they take our idols like that, man. I was like a man from Los Angeles. It's like, can they not can they not find another? Can we not have one thing? One thing to us. Can LA not have somebody? Dude, I was getting off the plane uh and there was a guy who was like he was talking to these two girls that he obviously just met and it was like in the like where you go before you get to customs and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and everyone's kind of like gathering themselves and he's talking and he's like this girl comes like, "Oh my god, I met this guy. He's a DJ." And he's like, "Uh." And she's like, "What's your DJ name?" And I wrote this down cuz he was like, "Oh, it's DJ K9." And they all kind of like laugh. And he's like, "Ah, no, no, it's not. It's Factor K." And I'm like, "What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] was that?" And I want to Factor K, if you're out there. That was terrible game. I can't. Were the Were the Hus chopped? The Hus. Uh, I think that's rude to say. Is it? I think I draw the line there. It is rude. It would be rude to say that about anybody, you know. Maybe. Yeah. Yeah, this guy's checking out your guys' bikes. He's wondering what's going on. He likes the bikes. Hi. Yeah, don't wave. That's what we want. Don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] wave. Don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] wave. Wait. Wait. Are you actually not allowed to wave? Genuinely waving off the respect you have for their country. Wait, for real? Yeah. Yeah. I swear to God, dude. I even waving. You're so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nice. You're so stupid. We've learned this. Dude, you can't wave. No, that was No, the trucker waved at us. Yeah, of course. But that guy was a whiteer. No shocker. That guy was not a white. Now try it with a with Hey, try that in a small town. I can't tell if you guys were [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with me. Kill yourself. That's what you're saying. Okay. Okay. Use a blown object. I felt the guy. We had food and I I said the food was oishi and he I felt him roll his eyes, man. He was really nice to me, but I just felt like he [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hat. That guy was thinking food was Oy. No, that's how Oy last night at dinner. That was the nicest guy we've met the whole time. Hate us. And I think he was right to hate us cuz we're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stupid. Chungus. We have been saying that a lot about ourselves. We've been getting down on ourselves. Yeah, because he [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] leaves us in the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dust. Cuz if we weren't stupid Chungus, he would have been here. Huh? Oh, this morning. Yeah. And it's our fault for being stupid. I was busy, bro. This is day nine. We're deep in this. Do you feel, Michael, after this is done, you'll feel empty? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Big time. Yeah. I mean, I'm excited to go back to uh my girlfriend, but not Los Angeles whatsoever. No, I dread going actually. It grows inside of me every day, and it's overcoming the fear of death. The fear of returning to Los Angeles. The Y equals MX plusb is rapidly approaching that point where they meet. I think I do like when when you come to Tokyo or somewhere else like it and you get used to that city style of living that's like so easy to navigate, get around, easy things like uh like going to 7-Eleven and like getting the nice like oni giri and or sick of them. You're sick of them already? We're pretty [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sick of them. There's only one that's still alive. It's the salmon flakes one from Lawson. But I think I think in general used to the idea of going back home to LA after a trip and like going back to traffic hell hole in normal shitty life. But this is the first time Yingling's been here. So it's been fun actually getting to see him discover all the sick [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about Japan again. Like being excited about 7-Eleven, being excited about you can get to experiencing it again. Yeah. Oh yeah. I uh I'm I'm excited to get back to the gamerhood personally. And that's a sweet. Do you know monkey is a is a is a slang term for a vagina? Do you know that? Yeah, it's monkey Monday. What are you doing? Show me your monkey. What are you doing, Michael? Don't just take a likes. He likes playing with gizmos and gadgets. You know, us people in our gizmos are doing, you know. Oh, sorry. Essing burning. Where we at time wise? Oh, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 50 minutes to go. Your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fault, you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] It's not my fault. You were You were like You wereounding us. You wereounding us. You sure just come with us. So you you know just go to sleep or we sleep cuz it Hey, 11. Hard out. Hard out. But we do it every day. This is what we have heard. This is the conversation you have with Dan every day. Um I think we get on 9 9:00 a.m. And start 1 p.m. starts. Look, the dryer wasn't ready. Oh, the dryer. I had to get I had to get some stuff. Show up on time to the you Yeah. There's this new like video going around of this guy. He's like how to have like a hustler lifestyle. And he wakes up like 4:00 a.m. and does push-ups on a balcony and there's like dunks his face in cucumber water and like by 5:00 a.m. he's like brushing his teeth and it's this insane viral thing. But you guys haven't seen it. We don't get to see those. We're behind. So you're behind. So by the time you come back to the internet that'll be out the door. That's kind of sad. Yeah. You're super outdated on basically everything. You're missing cultural experience. Has anything happened big terrorist attacks? Yeah. Any terrorist attacks? No. There was another van. No. I know. Many are saying could be the same damn one. No. That's insane cuz it's been so many years. I know. You would think that someone cleaned that one up. Uh but yeah, we're at war. Um so it's kind of rough. Yeah, it is. Is it nice? Is it kind of nice being offline? like you're just like not having any like you I especially for two people that are influencers, you're not usually going multiple weeks without checking the internet all the time. He misses YouTube shorts. I do. I'm It's a good thing. And I'm going to take this opportunity to IP block all you short form content at my house when I get back. I didn't know you were a Tik Tok short head. Uh YouTube shorts. I Well, the thing is I uninstalled every other like I installed Instagram and um freaking Tik Tok because it was like killing me. But I can't uninstall YouTube. I go to sleep. I listen to scary stories. That's what I do. I need it. Uh you listen to scary stories to fall asleep. Yeah, dude. You do yearn for the void. Well, it makes me feel safe. Like uh you know when you're like scared as a kid and you pull the blankets up and you feel safe? That's what I feel when I It's just a story. Mhm. I like get my head and then I fall asleep. But the shorts got you. The shorts got me cuz I can't uninstall YouTube. Yeah. So, I'm need to IP block them. Like, I wish I could just delete that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] button off there, but they got me really hard and I need I got me hard all the time. I need to get rid of them. On God, YouTube got me hard as hell. Lie in bed after having an active day. It feels so weird to not grab phone and like Yeah. spend an hour Yeah. just staring. What I've been going to cuz we have a few things we all lot is like YouTube comments. Do you get to read comments? We get to read some of the comments. Yeah, that's brought. No, but No, it makes me feel bad. But They're actually so Some are so sweet, some are so good. Some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] make us want to die. What? What are they saying that's evil? It's What was the one that I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] read out loud last night? There's just ones that's like Oh, it's an island. Just go to the water and turn north. Hey, am I crazy? They cooked. Yeah, they did lowkey cook, but it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sucks to read. I don't like hearing it. There's another one that's like 1960s. They just use maps. This isn't really a practice in anything but stupidity. Dude, it sounds like you're just getting [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] owned in awesome ways. But it's sick cuz I fall asleep within 5 minutes. Yeah, you go to sleep. The one other thing I have is the Ring app comments for neighbors. I was talking [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on mine. Oh, I love the Dude, I So you don't have any social media, but you're browsing Ring the Ring app. cuz I have the Ring in case I like I'm like, "Oh my god, is someone breaking in and killing Lily?" Um, so I have the Ring app, so I check whenever the notification pops up. Um, but it'll show like the neighborhood comment. It's like Yik Yak, if you remember Yik Yak area, Dude, it's so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] funny. They'll be like, "Why is your why is there a helicopter hovering at 3:00 a.m." And then I'll post showy foot pics drop and then or I'll be like I I'll go f someone will be like, "Oh, a lost dog. Does anyone know a lost dog on Beverly?" And I go, "Pound frowny face." He'll be on his phone laughing himself. I thought he was cracking, but he's just like, "Check this out. They replied to my dog comment." Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because um so it's it's usually one of two things. One, why is there a helicopter overhead? Which is like, shut the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. Who cares? Oh, you live in Los Angeles. Number two is always, "Was that a gunshot?" It's never funny. It's never a gunshot. It's never And then also porch pirates. They'll do a lot of porch pirates. They're driving around in a black Tesla. They're stealing things and I say, "He's kind of cute in the comments." I post the dumbest [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] It's my favorite [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Before I got on the plane, I just got cuz I just get the notifications because of the fires and stuff. And I was like, "Uh, it it was just I think I heard gunshots. Did anyone want to hear that?" And I'm I'm I have less finesse than you. I just said, "It's never gunshots, you stupid [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] boomer." And you can get banned off the app. I did read that. So, I'm kind of I'm kind of just fishing for it. Still haven't been mad until the day it is gunshots. And then so what? So what? Cuz then you just call the cops and then they show up and be like, "Damn, he got shot." Call the cops every time. They don't do [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and it doesn't matter. That's why there's a helicopter overhead. But yeah, it's been cool. Yling hates the bus. He didn't like being being a sergeant. He hated the bus. Bus kind of. What about the train? Train's the sickest. Train up bus. Yuck. Me you dude. What I've realized too is everyone uses the train to the point where we've been like striking up conversation with really nice Japanese people and we're like, "Yeah, how do we get to like the Hiimi?" And they'll be like, "Uh, don't know." They'll go, "I don't know." And we'll be like, "Where do you live?" And they're like, "Here." And we're like, "It's about 500 meters from you, maybe your whole life." Or we're carrying like our motorcycle helmet and we're like, "Hey, uh, how do you get to it on?" They're like, "By train?" And we're like, "Nope." Oh, I was watching the like episode two because it just came out uh before this and you ask how to get to Fukuoka and she's tells you how to find the train line. Yeah. Yeah. So, I can imagine that's just happening over and over. That happens a lot because nobody damn drives no damn car in this country. Got a helmet. They just like the Japanese mind cannot comprehend not taking the train, which I feel. It's so nice. We were in uh Osaka and it's like it kind of blows ass to ride the motorcycle there. It does. It sucked dude. We uh so I I we learned like a few phrases before getting here which have been carrying us a lot and we've learned new things too like shingo. What's that? That's what you had that one time. Travel light. Oh, you did have that that one time. Uh we learned uh goen which is the word for route. Mei road. But ah the ichi mii. Uh, but some of the phrases I brought that Chat GPT told me were ironclad have just been dog [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dude. Yeah, there I I I brought this up uh when you were gone. There was a post on the subreddit that was like he's got to stop using chat GPT cuz he was like he's like I speak Japanese Okay, it's like it's saying it's a normal thing is crazy. He says it's like it's like samurai [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] That's what the lady said. That's awesome. It's like saying like like I am indebted to your service for many many centuries and you know it's like and you're you're just reading that and be like yeah Chad GPT gave me the right answer. You should have stuck with your sex pest [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] teacher bro. He was way better than chat. He had he he had value. He had I mean look a lot of the things I learned is from him but I just wanted a few phrases. Some of them are good. My my alt non kokoyokos was chach that one works but I I asked too. I was like I was like, "Give me like a bigger thank you if someone really does like a nice thing for us." And you got the the the Hamurabi code and I got the samurai phrase and then and I was like, "Are you sure this is an extra?" And then Chi's like, "No, it's totally normal. You can use this in everyday conversation." I hate the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] voice, bro. But now I use it and sometimes it hits and they feel like you've been saying it to people. Oh, yeah. I still rip it. I rip it. What is that? What is the spectrum of reactions to something like that? It is. It is a Sometimes it's like the first lady, she's like, "My heart and then and then sometimes they're like, "Dude, what the a not to go taxi." It's just like a verbal fedora. Um, that's literally it. You are walking You're It's like walking across the the great American Midwest and wearing a fedora and going, "I thank you very much, my lady." But it's it's not like I'm not saying it like when the lady kissing people's hands. It's not like when the lady at Family Mart gives me a bag for my own. I'm saying it like when someone has like over the course of 20 minutes given us directions and information that they otherwise didn't have to. Isn't that Dude, what in the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] was that? I've been pretty good. Don't let him Don't let him talk you down for that one. I've been pretty good. I've been pretty good. Go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yourself. Look, I'm Italian, bro. And I'm Greek. And the Greek and the Japanese, they're probably fine. I have They're probably fine. Yeah. Not sure about their history. Historically, they feel a lot of apathy. I don't see any Greek food, but I'm sure they get along. Uh yeah, it's it's it's led me astray. I might I might learn Japanese when I get back. I probably won't. I'll be lazy again. Yeah. I was going to say when you're does this motivate you to go back and like learn more or try harder or without this goal to focus on anymore? Like for example, after this trip is over, you had said you were going to sell your motorbike at home, the one at home. Oh, yeah. So, is this motivating you to sell that? Uh, that's what he said. You're not selling it. He didn't tell you. Uh, when I originally was doing this, I was like, "Okay, I won't ride a motorcycle a lot, girlfriend. I'll just learn it and then I'll do this trip and then I won't ride it. But then we're on this trip and we're like, "Yo, what about across Europe trip?" And then I was like, "Dude, what about we go on the Silk Road?" That's a really good one. I want to do Vietnam. And we ride from Damascus to Beijing. Uh, you can do that. Poppy seeds and heroin to them. There are YouTube videos of people doing that. I know. It definitely is possible. It's wicked hard. I think those are my favorite. There's a there's a really really amazing YouTube video and I wish I remembered who made it uh of somebody biking from Beijing to all the way back home to the Netherlands and it is an awesome YouTube video and it takes him like a year. Yeah, it takes him a year. So [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to be like, "Yeah, we So we we're doing one upload this year." Um Yeah, that'd be dumb. Took my whole life. But I I think if you guys go on another trip, we were I mean we were we were kind of joking about it uh earlier. But you guys choosing a different uh choosing a different country and maybe doing something even a bit more extreme would be would be super interesting to see after this. Yeah, we've been thinking about it. We've been mulling it over, but you know, I I think we still got this trip which we haven't hit the hard part, quote unquote. Yeah. We'll see how I feel after my ankle gets turned the opposite direction when the bike falls on it. Yeah. Is Hokkaido the hard part? Yeah, cuz Hokkaido, it's still March. It's quite snowy. I don't know how the roads will be. Some roads are just closed down and we won't know because we can't read the road signs. That's cool. And so it's very possible we get to Hokkaido and just get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] boomed in a way that um like makes us miserable. I never want to ride a motorcycle again. Maybe. or just straight up uh not alive anymore. So, you know, Michael, do you are you do you consider yourself a content creator? You're like out of it. You're like, "No, I do it. It's not what he does. I'm creating content right now." Sure, but it's like you make you make a video every four months. Way long. You don't got that He got that sweet monkey that State Farm can't get rid of, but you like they come to your monkey and they're like, "What do you think?" And you're like, "My monkeyy's sour. Yeah, I think my monkey's all soured in. So, it's like, yeah, technically you're a content creator, but it's like, do you feel like one? No, I'm more of a mcrafter. I play a lot of Minecraft every day. Every day? A lot of days, though. Are you kidding me? You really play Minecraft every day? Not every day. Every other day. Do you have like a sick ass server? Yeah, my roommates. We got We have a create mod server. You guys ever play Create Mod? Super good. You You play Modern Minecraft like the factory mods where you like do production and stuff? No, I'll barely. Dude, this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you can have like grains and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in this one and then you have your logistics and they go it's like factorial but a Minecraft. So you're playing and you're you're hitting the Minecraft bong most days. A lot of days I hit Minecraft bong. A lot of days I'll just do some I don't know random [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like uh I'm trying to learn um like mo like like engines. Trying to learn engines. Oh no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Cuz I'm not really good at engines. Like car engines. Like motorcycle car engines. Yeah. I'm starting on motorcycles cuz they're smaller. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I had this idea. I used to work in a parts department. I I I had this idea that he should take out a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] engine and try to put one back in in one stream. That would be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sweet. That'd be really funny. And he wouldn't be able to do it. Um, but he he actually was like he responded to me and he was like, "What if I could never finish it?" And I'm like, "I don't care. Do it. Turn on the camera now." Hey, Michael likes the idea for the the engine. Yeah. I'll do it with Michael. That'll make my life easier. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I want to learn how to do it. I think it'd be sweet. Michael will drive or see like another motorcycle. He'd be like, "Yep, four pistons. They go this way." Yeah, it's cool. It's nine hours a day. I got to talk about it something, man. I'm trying to think, what's my relative thing? Some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] It's literally anime. It is some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] It's literally anime. You know the director of Yojimbo? Do you know he tried to kill himself? Do you know the director of Yojimbo? A cultural classic. I can't even [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] talk [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] It's like, it's a great movie. It's a phenomenal movie. And then I go pistons go this way together and the other person just pretends because it's a boxer engine. Michael because it's a boxer engine. Thank you. See, he [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] gets up. We saw it yesterday. We saw a big old BMW with a fat boxer engine. But they got those in the BMWs. Just uh I think the BMW is the only bikes who do do it. Uh Subarus. Subaru has a boxers. Uh the only bikes who does it. Yeah. Oh, bikes. I thought you said I thought you said baka and I thought you I thought you was calling me a damn baka. I love that name. You guys know that meme? No. Oh, so you're behind. It's a meme. So you're behind. I am behind. I watch. It's like It's like a kid in a cafeteria and he'll stand up on a on like he'll start going and they'll stand on like a cafeteria uh table and he'll go This is an American child. Uh it's I think it started in Japan, maybe made it way. It's It's just the generic meme. Not like one specific. It's kind of like the the head so good Chia honor roll but for a bucka. I don't know what he means by that. Buck. He's so old to be written. I've been with him the whole time since I'm 30. I turned 30 and I see the world differently now. Yeah. There's less color. You're a different person now. I passed you up. But when I say she rid the dick like a carnival, I get made fun of and it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] disgusting. It's really not. You're just referencing Kanye in 2025. I didn't I didn't even know it was him for a long time. That's crazy. Yeah. I That's crazy. There's just some passages I found from this book, Mine Comp. I don't know who wrote the thing. What am I supposed to like that? And I was like, it's a little like that. That's what I was thinking, too. It's a little like that. Do I have the decimal system memorized? Dude, I didn't I didn't want to come. I remember. So, you were going we like cuz Nick didn't want to go because he's doing a bunch of traveling. And then I was like, I have to go cuz otherwise it's like Aiden and Lwig and Michael Reeves. And if if that if I if I let that happen, Michael would end up killing Aiden cuz he's so annoying. And I'm like, well, that then the blood's out. I've been stopping him this whole time. Oh, I did. You know what? I did scared of it. Like a lantern. I did genuinely feel bad last night and because I got so excited and I when I scared you guys when I waved you down, I felt bad. That was hype. It was It was It was just weird in the moment to see someone Dude, it's been just the It's not even like a normal Japan trip. Like I know how it feels normal Japan trip. It would just been [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] looking at the road and going that car might kill me. That truck. Is it really feel like like that dangerous to just ride a bike? Like what is How is this different from riding around in LA or is it not? LA's also scary. Yeah, probably. It's just riding a bike. If we hit a K truck here, I'd [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] win. I was going to say fly through it like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Superman. It's amount of hours on the road. Yeah. So, it's like it's fine to ride around in LA for 30 minutes cuz then you're done the ride. But here we're riding we've probably ridden nine days or I guess eight days. Do you get sore? Yeah. My ass, dude. We probably like 50 hours. How are the asses, guys? Bad. Gu is bad. And sometimes the little bit of the scrot gets pinched under the goo and that really blows. At least you don't have movie balls. Back hurts. If you had big prosthetic movie balls, it'd be even worse. They would hang off the sides of the bike and they would mine would drape a bit. Yeah. What is I did want to ask because we've seen we can see where you guys are because he has find a friend and even though your phone is like on airplane mode or off or whatever, the GPS still works so we can see where you are. Uh and we see you guys like maybe you'll make a wrong turn and you'll like backtrack, get back on like some route that you were going before. Do what is the furthest you've had to backtrack on the trip? Like how much what was the worst wrong turn of the trip? We don't know. Yeah. I guess like sometimes we'll make a wrong thing, but then it's like we'll just keep going. We've committed really hard. Sure. It's it's more like so for example, when we left Cape Sata, which is the southernmost point, there was an option to go left to Kagashima and we went right and then we continued to Miyazaki. We still don't know if we went to the island Miyazaki or if it is an island. They gave him an whole island for Elder Ring. We don't know. We don't know. They might have given him an a whole damn island or it might have been a city they gifted. Ha, Miyazaki. We don't know. We don't know these things. So, he deserves it. So, it's more like we just have to continue down this path and uh and and so like the amount of time we've lost is not something we'll know until we watch the videos after we're done. So, anyway, our cameras died cuz it's hot. Because if we would have done this earlier, it probably wouldn't heat it up. That's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] How does the look? You know, we landed We landed. It was my birthday. Uhhuh. Landed. I turned 30. And I just see the world differently. There's not There's not a lot of space between us. Look how far he is. Look how much we're cozied up. Everything's in [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with you, bro. Michael Reeves is done with Lwig, dude. Relationship is over. That's going to be episode three. You're jealous, bro. We get along. I'm not jealous. I actually think Michael is very cool and he's very lucky to have you. And you and you can if you would like to. Yes, Michael. You may marry my daughter. You may. Are you interested in Michael consummating this relation? I don't want it. Oh, okay. Maybe. Now we're Let's just skip to the consummation. I'm very I'm very protective of him. Stop talking about me like that. Wait, what is your problem? You never satisfied. You got a sweet monkey and we don't like when that goes around. You don't like when my monkey goes around. None of you have a taste of my monkey. No, you've got a damn taste. Michael, have you tasted his monkey? I ain't got a little actually the onen I got a little peeky. You guys want to do an onen? We've been to like four, man. Been to several. So, you have seen these movie balls. I've seen wiener. I seen I flick it around. I do mine. I thought you changes really hard. Ow. I hate this. Wait, Michael, are you cut or uncut? Uh, cuts. Cut. Closer. Closer. That's This is the dumb cut side. Couple uncut boys over here. It just makes more sense over here. It makes more sense. What? You don't want to ever freaking grow bacteria in there? Sometimes he stuffs pistachios in his for the plane ride. I don't I don't do that. Just the shells. It's like my gummy bacco. cuz there's no trash in Japan. You must store it somewhere. Yeah, we're just trying to get through this cuz that's what that's what the podcast is, bro. He just tries to get through it so we can get on with this. Oh, look. We were we were [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we've been slogging. You don't understand. You've been slogging. We've been in Little Pillow Princess Hotel. Slogging. There's video footage of the Dude, you're being mean. You don't understand what we've been through. No, I don't. I don't mean now. Have you noticed that? I know. He's become an ass. I have a question. Shut up. I have a question. I have an important question. Shut the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Michael, do you think I'm I got to pick my nails again? I don't know. Michael, Michael, do you watch Dogen ever? Do you know Dogen, the YouTuber? I've been told about him a lot. He lives in Beu. Do you watch Dogen? Yeah. Uh I was watching Dogen's newest video. Uh and the the disillusion of the the foreigner. I've seen that. And I was like, "Oh, this is an enjoyable video." I'm watching the first like minute in the hotel room and he's listening to the audio and he he rolls over because he's curled in fetal position watching a YouTube video on his phone and then he says, "You listening to that incel [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Why are you listening to incel [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out loud in this room?" That's what it was. No, it wasn't. He was talking about how he used to see women as objects like chairs and items. How can How can he not talk to girls, bro? He's like he didn't hear the even the whole I listen to enough. No, half a sentence of the YouTube video and he does this. This has been going on all the time. It's not a trip this trip. What are you talking about? Personality trait. It's not a personality trait. It's a mounting though. I feel like it's getting worse. Is Japan softening you? Are you becoming nicer? Of course I am. Tell Say thank you again. You got to stop doing the B. Rate my rate my Eddie got us. I look I just young boy better. We just have four virgins being like who gets [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the most. What are you asking me for? Yo, wait. You guys are experts. Uh I don't think I sound good when I speak Japanese. I'm just very confident. And what I do is I go that's actually a huge lesson. And then I repeat back what they say. And then after the whole conversation's done and they stop talking, I go s, which just means I don't understand what you're saying, Michael. The problem here is the problem is that everyone who's listening to this episode's going to get pissed off that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that we talked over you and that we barged in on your spiritual being as a man. Pretty angry. We're sorry. I know. Yeah. And it's Aiden's fault. And I I talked to you about that and I told you that it would be a problem. And I have to I He was snarling, bro. He was trying to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kill you under his bridge. And I want to ask you, what do you wish to tell the people? What do you wish to tell the people on this platform that you usually don't have? This this channel gets probably a hundred thousand thousands of more views. Gets like hundreds of thousands of views. You can end it there. It's probably broadcast right now in some sort of capital in the world. But what would you like to say? Capital One Bank. I would hope so. You could be on a TV there. Dubai, Washington DC. Someone's watching right now for sure. This is your chance. [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] We have said that so many times. Is that some of the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's gone on in the helmet? That is That's some of the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that goes on in the helmet. It's plotting. Got to beat that one, Archie. Dude, I want to be I want to be in the helmetcom. Dude, the closest I've ever been to Lwig helmetcoms was in Italy on the back of the bike and I would whisper in Lewig's ear and then he'd turn and whisper back to me. And I think that's the closest we've ever gotten to helmet comms. Something about a bike really does activate him. Maybe it activates all all humans on a spiritual level cuz you're in such danger and you're going so fast. But it's so cool and magic and you feel like you're flying. Yeah. Is it addicting? Yeah. Yeah, it's fun. It's really fun. It's not like drug. It's just really fun. It's just really fun. It's just transport's not fun at all for the most part. True. But bike transport is fun. Car transport is very like there, dude, there's been so much traffic. That kind of surprised me because I Where where is the the traffic? I know that sounds Hey, there's trains here. Japanese people still love the car. The Nagoyans love their cars. Goyans [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with cars so heavily. Yeah, it's pretty gross and bad uh in a lot of places. I guess during rush hour, you know. Yeah. Trying to get it to work. Yeah, we um we've we've made quicker work of it because of the bikes. We follow this guy around. I don't think we filmed any of it, but there's this guy OG sensei. No, I did, man. Did you film OG sensei? Put any of it in cuz I can't put a single second of it in. Why did OG Sensei do? You told us about him. You think we influencers? He influenced us to do he went OG Sensei and OG on the road. What did OG Sensei tell you? OG sensei didn't speak with his words. He spoke with his actions. He was like if Akira from the movie Akira, which I've never seen, got 50 years old and never stopped riding bikes. Akira all grown up, but it's Rugrats. And there's the Rugrats are still there, but Akira's also there. And Tetsuo is just more of a hulking mass of flesh. He looks really bad. He becomes Jabba. Okay. Okay. Uh yeah, he's like this 50-year-old white hair motorcycle. He had a big motorcycle, too. Huge motor. He had a Ducati with like three exhausts on it and they were all coming out and it sounded so sick. And normally we split a little bit of lanes, but he was like Choto split. Choto split. But he's freaking the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out. He was like left and right checking. He He stood up. He wiggled his ass. So he's weaving in between lanes in a country where, by the way, if you go up like if you if you look through the traffic, if you were to get a bird's eye view, motorcycles sit behind other cars in traffic. like they're not a car. They think they're a car. Oh, not not everyone, but most do this. I feel like in especially in Asia, like comparing that to the rest of motorcycle culture in Asia, that's insane. So different. We saw the world's fastest bike motorcycle waiting behind a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] minivan. The world. It's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Ninja H2R and it's just sitting in hot traffic. Do you see what the guy looked like driving it? Badass. Yes, sir. Behind. badass and behind the minivan. I just I wonder if it's like when a 70-year-old guy like buys a Porsche because he's it's almost over and he's like, you know, he's just going to the store with it and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Get it over with faster. Anyway, OG sensei was splitting like a demon and we try to follow him, but he did ditch us and at one point he shook his butt at me like the like the the monkey in um Twilight Princess. He stood up like and you have to use the you you had to use the Gail boomerang to take OG sensei off his bike and return him to you. And he did this behind his back which is either waving or like I will crush you. I will crush you like with a truck. So he's one of the nice figures we've seen who have guided us. We didn't talk to him at all but he I feel like he communicated with me by his actions. Do you have a Mount Rushmore of like the people Washington is Oji son. Okay. He was the coolest dude. Yep. And he see he was early so he set the bar and he was early and dude he did like he pretended to be a samurai with his stick. Yeah, he freaking he was standing up and then he went, "That's sick." This man's like 70 years old. He was like, "You're going to go to Ozu Samurai Town." Nice. And I was like, "Yo, Jimbo." He's like, "Yeah, you know, the guy tried to kill himself." Fun facts. Uh, yeah. There was Oji son. Okay. Who else? The lady at the mart. Yeah. First lady. Yeah. This is from episode one. She helped us for 20 minutes. Drew a detailed map. Did baseball actions. Yeah, she seemed wonderful. She was like, "Dude, I liked when she was describing I think the big hotel." She like was was outlining it with her hands and jumped. Yeah. This hotel big as hell. She's just so amped. Yeah. She was Mount Rushmore. The guys at the biker bar have all been super good. Wait, was the biker bar where you guys got drunk and then continued to drive? No, that's not the not that one. That was a Yaki Niku place. The biker bar was there's one there's a place called Carol Way which I think is named by the boy band Carol which was semi famous in Japan in Ichi Yazawa became mega famous celebrity in Japan club seven for Japan almost exactly correct and anyway we went to that biker bar they ruled but we also went to this other biker bar in Hakon called Super Rare which also ruled what are biker bars like here is everyone like wearing like is it I imagine in my head it's It's a bunch of hardl looking dudes smoking cigarettes and have leather jackets and like almost No, it's actually the So, you're thinking of America? What we were talking about this yesterday? Also, it's not a bar. These are cafes. Yeah, they're cafes. Oh, not alcohol. I'm calling them biker bars. They're cafes, right? Cuz you don't want to drink and then drive a motorcycle. But they're lowkey. No, no, no. Uh the one thing I noticed yesterday there like uh if you're looking at the proportion of men to women in terms of like motorcycle riders. Let me tell you about females. Way more of these women. Yo, it's like the guy you were watching. The guy mean you're being mean. I'm not being mean. I just I watched 4 seconds of his video and I made a judgment on his whole character and personality. 4 seconds is being generous. How is that mean? There's a lot more women who ride motorcycles in this country. Okay. Yeah. It's like almost it feels equal and I feel like America it's like 9010are like there's a biker girl like like uh stereotype. Yeah. Which I don't think exists here. You're just girl who rides a motorcycle. Right. Right. Right. Uh so the biker bars are not like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] harden tothed [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] guys. It's like guys and girls being like, "Yeah, we're freaking just chit cchatting. This is just how we decide to travel." Yes. Yeah. And they'll make a bar or they'll make a cafe about it. And it's kind of cool cuz you know there's no doctor cafe. There's no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Yeah. There's no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fisherman cafe. Yeah. There's biker cafes. Pretty sweet. Also though too we've been to is has been like couples who run it. I'm pretty sure couples. Yeah.
