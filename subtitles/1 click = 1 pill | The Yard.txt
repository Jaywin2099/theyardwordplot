 You pathetic worm, bro. King James version. Yo, dude, they got a store for you. Dude, they got a store for you. Look, it's Do you shop there? Dude, it's a store for you. God, that's funny. Oh, man. That's funny. You know, Kelby said the nicest thing he ever said to me today. Yeah. What is that? He said, because he was talking about, I I I've been playing League, me and Nick, and we've been crashing out. I've been crashing out like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy. Nick has slight slight crash outs, but they are crash outs nonetheless. I go through his unbanned forms. I don't think he knows how to access them cuz I just I just like to look at them. I don't deny or accept. He didn't even know there's forms. Yeah. But I look at them and I can see what the person said and it's literally just likel 20,000 gold and no back or something like that. It's very f. It's like just, you know, being an [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about how he's playing and I'm like, "Oh, Nick banned that. I like that." I go through yours and it's it's like 10 people and all they've typed is a is uh 07. Like, what's your favorite song? No, I explained myself now. I have this new Oh my god. I Okay, I'm going to talk about my personal journey of emotions through the lens of the video game without talking about the video game specifically. Are we okay with that, audience? Okay. Check box. Yes. if you say yes. All right. So, I've been in a great mindset lately where I give people like Aiden does the benefit of the doubt. I I I swear to God, I'm looking at the world through like how like a fan would. I'm speaking less. I'm listening more. You know, all the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's been happening in the world. I don't tweet anymore. I just type it out on my phone. Don't tweet it out. And I'm like, this is so much less stressful. Tylenol maxing. I'm Tylenol. I'm Tylenol maxing. Yeah. Yeah. I walk on my toes. So what? And I'm like, this is this is such an interesting like new perspective for me that's being consistent. It's this is this was awesome. It was someone cuz I was watching Slime all day yesterday and someone I was watching both of you guys, but someone's on the TV and someone goes in the TV. I I literally I said that's a TV choice. I said that that's the TV stream. Mine's the cell phone in the pocket. You can listen to the audio. Someone pops in chat and they say, "I love Yard DND. I listen to every episode. I just have a question. I wonder why you guys are rolling with digital dice instead of physical ones." I This is where you did chime in. I remember that. And and Slime goes, "Not the time. Appreciate it. Not the time. Just not going to answer that." No, here's what I said. And And it's very similar, but I said, "You have a large boogie. I have to point it out." Oh, thank you. Okay, Archie, censor that. Wipe it on the chair. Yeah, I almost did. I almost did. people would know. Wipe it on the chair. I'm going to wipe it on my leg. Ew. It's just It's wet boogie. It's not Yeah, that's grosser. Yeah. I think it makes me feel worse cuz he has like a fabric chair and not a metal one. I didn't I didn't do it. Swedish man. I am very sweet. I want to do it, but I'm trying to pick a thing I can do it with. You have to pick other countries. Whoa. Random brand deodorant wipes. Um, so yeah, it so anyway, uh, what I said was, "Hey man, that's really awesome. I'm having the worst day of League of all time that I could ever experience. I don't really want to talk about whether or not we do that, but if you come and find me and catch me on a day where I'm not feeling like this, I will sit and I will talk to you about DN D." Didn't do, you know, this guy replied, "Okay, okay, I got it." No, he said, "No problem." Yeah. And I was like I was like, "All you got to do is explain your thoughts. You explain your thoughts, everything will be okay." You're such a sweet boy. And that's the part of me that is being more explicative of like, okay, maybe I'm pissy, but I'm going to sit with you and be like, you know what I say a lot? It's not your fault. It's not your fault. You don't know that. You don't know that I'm upset right now, and that's okay. And it's not your fault. I've been I I And then they just say, "My bad." And I'm like, "All right, I have been with you." It's I think it's funny though is that the same way you remember your own like highlights is like the same way you think like everyone in League is toxic because of the three guys in chat because there is a mountain of crashs under that one under that one moment of explained it to everyone. It's everyone was there. I mean this is a good question right? If we if we fully explain our uh the reasons behind our emotions, does it absolve us from displaying them? Oh my god. Can I do your own band forms today? They're I do them. I have dessert after the stream and I do them. Why don't you leave them for but just let Dub Oh, sure. Sure. Let me eat today. You could have Let me eat your dessert today. You're going to play League today and then I want to eat your dessert after and I get to choose. Dude, you're you're edging so it's that much better when you when you beat off at night. Dude, I almost He's He's like sep He's separating the Oreo. He's separating the Oreo and then he just leaves a pile of cream for cream later. He takes a cookie right now. And I bet some days he goes through more Oreos than he should cuz he's being bad cuz he's like, "Oh, I'll have more cream later." be like, I don't even I had a salad yesterday. I do like the idea of being like so upset and but you're you're banning people with the intention of giving yourself dessert because you get to read. I don't think you're doing that, but the idea of like it's like I'm going to ban this. I think you slow stroke it when you read the apologies in the unban forms. Sometimes I tell them if you clutch the unbanned form, welcome back. I literally say this is your chance. And sometimes I get real [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mean. Sometimes they they talk about the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that they know about me in my personal life that like I'd rather not talk about as a way to hurt me. There was a guy I don't remember what he said. Maybe you will. He said something along the lines of like, "Yo, bro, you ever in your lane, homie?" And then you banned him and you're like, "You don't talk like that in real life." And then you paused and you were like, "Maybe you do." No, that that guy that guy does. There was a guy there was a guy who was just talking like I know. I was like, "You don't talk like that in real life." What I often say if if someone is is mad, I love how this is so fun to talk about for you guys. I could talk about it all day. This is my dessert. This is my dessert. Cuz sometimes dessert in the morning. Dessert for breakfast. We get to dig through the psychology of Anthony Bruno. We aren't watching like me and Yingo are not watching us on the TV necessarily for the top lane gameplay. I don't know if this is breaking news, but I understand. Well, Kelby, like I said, he said the cuz he he's like, "Okay, Slime, so when you lose a fight in top lane and then you run right back to lane and fight again, are you tilted? Do you think that's good?" And I'm like, "Okay, rude question to ask. I just woke up." He's like, "Right before we do the pod and and he's like, but I told him I was like cuz I was like cuz sometimes, man, my champ wins those fights. I'm not just I am tilted, but it's like I'm taking a calculated [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] coin flip that is weighted toward there and I'm going for it. He's like, "Oh, so you're not just like running it down." It's like, "No, I'm not running it down. It looks like that." But sometimes I win those. And me calculating my coin flip. Damn. Still 50/50. Let's run it. It's called the weighted coin flip and they're real. Anyway, so but you know, you know, in like in the Phantom Menace when when Qui-Gon's like trying to move the dice with the forest, he's like he thinks he's doing that. Yeah, it's just a guy doing this at [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Vegas. No, you know what it is? It's quiet on trying to do a mind trick on W who died. The tridarian who is You cannot do Jedi mind tricks on a tridarian. Yeah, you can't. And uh and the top lane is W and you keep thinking one time your Jedi mind trick will work cuz it's worked on so many and he's a slave owner. So think about that. Anyway, so his moral obligation to win the land. You can't say Kelby within a 5 yard distance or he's too pale. You got to slow down. Kelby said to me, he's like, "Okay, well, I mean, when you get mad, it's very entertaining." And I was like, "Okay, good. I'm glad. I'm glad there's some value out of this." What did he messaged me yesterday, bro? Cuz he messaged me. The whole gang was watching, man. What he said was, and what I found very touching, cuz I guess I'm an insane Tylenol launcher, is that he said, "You're I was like, there's no I'm not making it up. I'm not playing it up. I'm really that mad at a video game and that everyone's laughing at me." And he said, "Your natural state then is very entertaining." And that was the nicest thing he ever said to me. He wrote to me, "Bro, the willpower I am exerting to not slip in type in Slime's chat during any of these games." And I wrote, "It's upsetting." And that was our conversation. Pure willpower. I'm always nice to you. Huh? No, no, no. Kelby said that. No. Kelby said the willpower to not type cuz you know Kelby thinks evil thoughts. Kelby wants to usually type the first thing that'll push her buttons, but then usually gauges whether that will send you into a death spiral or not. You can get away with anything in that chat. I Well, I sometimes you just get sad. So, I don't want to make them sad. I do. But, bro, well, sad and you're a sadness package. I get it. I want to say everyone is vindicated for the years that they watched me and they said that I am like a Instagram ad that's bad on purpose to make people play the game. I get it cuz everything I am Oh my god. I see through you. Yeah, we are. You are. We are the same. During your Mario speedrun yesterday when chat was like, "Is this a first time playthrough?" That was really funny. No, they said this. Is this a blind play through against Zayn? Yeah. I got [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crushed by Zayn not Has Z been playing for like a week? Yeah, Zay's been playing for 5 days and I boot up the game and it wasn't close and I get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on. He PBS in the race. like he gets his best ever run in the race. Wait, how is that possible? Yeah, 19-minute run. Pretty good. It was pretty good. 16. It was 16 star. It Well, it's it's possible, Aiden, because he understands nothing about the game. He's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] idiot when it comes to this game. But there's one line that if he takes where like if he just perfectly [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] walks between these two buildings on this line, he's a god. What's the line? It's the 16 star line that he knows. It's the 16 stars. He doesn't know a 17th star. Yeah, he couldn't tell you. That's so funny. Okay. Well, you're like 17 stars, Zane. And he's like, "All right, I'll find one." If I said go to Tall Tall Mountain for a billion dollars and you can't have help, it would take it would it would take them years. It's jumping into the paintings that don't have stages. You'd be guessing. Is this tall? This is This is cope cuz it's like it's like getting mad at a competitive Melee player for like not knowing all the trophies. It's No. No. For not knowing all the characters. He he he he didn't know that you couldn't lock Mew if Mewtwo if you left your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] console on. That's where he's at. But but he has this one line where he's really good and he and he won. And now he made me I have to write an essay now. I have to write that was the 200 words. I have to write a five paragraph essay about how Zayn is the melee goat over Hungry Box. This is which is genius. It doesn't even make sense. It's like a world. It's like why would that be the conversation? Why was that the convers where's mango in this conversation? I don't know what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this is this guy because there's I feel like there's it's so hard to find an amount of money that you could both do that would hurt you but this uses your time. Time is the best thing and this is and and your time taken away from you D. You don't like that. So funny cuz Zayn was supposed to race Armada who would have crushed Zayn. Yeah, I think they would have done like some odds bet for sure. It would have been like so he found a guy he can beat. Bro, I thought I was gonna beat his ass. Dude, before before the race, you're like first first round, I'm gonna go for some dumb [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm gonna go for dumb [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] The first race you were like three stars behind in the first four minutes. Was it like a best of three? It was a best of three, but I paid to like be exonerated of two games. So, it was basically a best of five. Oh my god. Wait, so you It's It's when you lose the best of three, you best of five. Yes. You know, he hit he hit him with it wasn't even best of five cuz it was he hit him with all the marbles one match. Oh my god. Uh and then quit halfway through cuz I still got [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cream, dude. And then after, dude, it was actually a day of L's the the between the streams cuz after the stream you were like, "Oh, I want to play this new game." And you're like, "Oh, where's my code for the game?" All the other streamers have codes. Le's the only one without a code. Dude, everyone through his email on stream. I thought the game was out cuz everyone been playing the game. He's tweeting at Devolver. Can I get a code? It's a Devolver game and they didn't hit you up. Bennett F made a new game. The guy made Getting Over. It made his first game in 8 years. You didn't get one? I didn't get a code. That's actually kind of crazy. Much [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dick I've been putting. To be fair, you're you're owed a code. I'm Anyway, they got me a code which is sick. I play it for an hour. As I'm playing it, I like trigger a cut scene. on my screen it says kernel error and the whole [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] computer shuts down from the game. Nice. The whole computer shuts down. Yes. The whole [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] came Vanguard. And then I open it back up and it didn't save. And so I'm GG. They lost you. They lost you on stream. They lost you. You know what? They shouldn't have given you a code. They shouldn't have given me a code, bro. Damn. Yeah, that sucks. Is that the one where like you're moving your guy with every limb and he looks all like 3D quap and he looks like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Doc O. Yeah, but fat and he got a divorce. Tyl was it kind of like a Tylenol only baby shows up. This I I unfortunately think this has some legs. It might I might be telling Tylenol jokes a year from now. Kind of a controversial opinion trying to reverse autism. Kind of the dopest thing he's ever tried to do. going against big pharma for for once he has a goal. Yeah, that isn't the worst thing in the world. I like how he's tackling Tylenol, too. That's a big one. Yeah. Two two are beefing. He's not going for an Easter drug. He Dude, you know why he's saying Tylenol? Cuz it's easier to say than acettophen. Yeah, that's why he keeps saying it. So, he's saying a brand, which is crazy. It's like the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] president going like, "Pepsi is bad." Yeah. And it's like, well, what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] not knowing. There's definitely some people who are they're getting their they're getting their generic acettophen and they're like, "Well, this is fine. This is fine. This is not Tylenol. Don't say Tylenol. I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] my sister tonight. Everything's going to be fine. We're going against big pharma." And everyone's like, "Okay, I like that." It's like, "Tylenol is first." We're like, "Yeah, all right. Yeah, bad for you." We all know that. Bad for you, dude. It's giving you autism. [Music] Hold on. back up. Why? I uh it's also the Rapture today. Yeah. So, yeah, I'm afra I'm I'm afraid to play my league matches today during the rapture. I feel like maybe I should skip a day. Well, no. I think maybe it could be good because the last time when I hit Platt, it was also the Rapture is when California was on fire. So, I think it I think in a in a way it makes the rift a safe place. Wow. A safe place, but all the all the righteous are pulled up. Yeah. That's why That's why the That's why the rift is a safe place cuz there's no one righteous on the rift. So, everyone's the same. Everyone's the same on the rift. You're all evil once you go to Summoner's Rift. When Autism's finally gone, where did all the Cinch players go? Why are they gone? Why are no Shico players in the game anymore? So weird. Just say about any character. Why is everyone playing Vex now? Aiden Ross is back on Twitch, too. Yeah, they just Aiden Ross is back, dude. I got to comp my SEO it's crumbling. You're Yeah, you are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Oh yeah. Do you know for years when I would say, "Hey Siri, call Aiden." It would call Aiden Ross. Just knew the more famous number. It would just every time call Aiden. I don't It's crazy cuz I've surely we have called each other more. I mean, yeah, but I don't So why wouldn't it default to me? I don't think she I don't I'm actually more surprised that for years you've been calling Aiden. Well, you haven't called me in years. I haven't got a phone call from you in years. We've called. Oh, yeah. We've called, right? What have we talked about? What's the one thing we talked about? One thing that you've talked about conversation. Okay. In my defense. You're already You're already on the Yes, I'm on the I'm on the call. I'm on the back foot. Okay. In my defense, he's a silent concession. These are usually not fun. Out of the blue calls to see what Aiden's up to. This is usually for years is what you said. Yes. Aiden's been working me for years. True. It is true. I have been working because when he was doing just merch, you were like, "Hey, Aiden, how's the merch going?" Just want to drop in on that one. Let's Let's check. I'd love to get you some feedback on how merch. Can I Can I not be a CEO for a second? One of my favorite things about Aiden and Lwig's relationship is is the picture, you know, that picture of the the the drawn woman just begging a man and she's like screaming like, "Babe, please." Yes. And it's it's it's just Lwig, please approve these designs. Please, he has to just look at the designs. And there's a lot of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he doesn't do that he needs to do right away, but this is the particular one cuz it's like I would consider it the more the more fun one. And he's like, "Please just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] approve the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] designs." And then Lwig will go and be like, "I don't like any of these." And you see Aiden's like he just his eye just twitches and he can't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] That wasn't one of the choices. False dichotomy. False dichotomy. But yeah. Yeah. No, whatever you want, babe. See, now he's Tyler. You turned him into Tyler. Tyler Braden. I'm like the Hulk. I guess if you get too tilted in my leg. You wouldn't like me when I have a four loco. Yeah. I I It's Bloodwig. Also, the the merch will come out. For instance, these basketball shorts, which are very comfortable. I love those basketball shorts. Go short. Shut up. You go. Just be quiet and let him talk about it. I don't want to hear about he will he'll he'll it'll come out and he'll be like I don't really like that one. So he like won't promote it out of like not protest but he just doesn't like it. He doesn't like a design that went from start to finish. That's not true. You're I think I think actually a better I think the best example because I I think the best example we have is of the blue jacket we did for his bakery drop which is actually really nice. I think I think it came out really well. Love that jacket. We we had spent so long on that draw. We spent like 9 months designing it. Lewig has like a hand in like looking at things and improving things through the whole process. We've gotten the final version of the jacket and it has uh blue stitching on top of a blue jacket which depending on whether or not you want it to blend in tonal. Uh you know, you may or may not like that better than if the stitching was like white, right? And Lewig sees this like two weeks before it's going to go out and he's like, "Why do we do that?" And I'm like, and I looked at him and my world's crumbling around me. I look at him and I was like, "You you approved it. You told me I was ugly and you said I like you. You ug and you said I was okay. I am not responsible for my past decision." I got an idea for you. Who is I look at everything with fresh eyes. It's one of my greatest qualities. That which unfortunately is a little true and I that's what I hate about that statement. I have fresh eyes every time I look at something cuz I forget everything I've done. It's true. Aiden, every drop you need to embroider something onto the tag. Like I'm Lwig and I'm a pedophile. Yeah. Or you know I'm Lwig. I'm a mass murderer. Like a swastika. They're like a swastika. And every drop Lewig must tell you to remove it, but he has to know what it is in order to get it removed before it goes out. you have to find it. He has to find it and say, "Remove the swats again." And he'd be like, "Of course." Why would we want that to go out? He would just get really good at identifying shapes. Like he he would he would find a way to short change this and be like, "Yeah, there it is. Found it. Okay, get it out of there." And then two two weeks before the drop, why is it blue on? Pretty soon when autism's gone, we're going to need more people to be good at shapes. So, if you can get Mark that down for y'all and I and I'll keep a secret bottle of that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on me at all times. Papa Tyler like it's the invincible pill. Yeah, the pill I took in Aiza. How was uh how was the I didn't watch a damn minute of the camp. It was CP. You ain't watching any CP? There's no way. It Yeah, Camp Peak, right? Y it's I didn't No, I didn't I didn't tune into the CP. So, they shortened it. Yeah. To the letters that All the Young F guys were there. Yeah. Having a blast. CP. We had the Faz boy. We had Nut, right? Nut was nothing. Nut was a CP. Yes, sir. CP and Nut collab. Mhm. It was a collab. Collab. So, how was it? The Rose Rose Bud Thorn. Uh, Rose Bud Thorn. Um, honestly, Thorn is being 30. Oh, they reminded you, huh? And fat. Oh, they reminded you, huh? I said extra guess my weight. She said 250. two. I said I said, "Ah, down a little." She goes, "220." Like, like she refuses to believe it's under two. And I go and I go, "Let's start with a different digit." And she goes, "No, get her on here, man. Get her on here." Be serious. Now, the neutral was when I was peeing in my own bedroom, sitting down in this weird [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up bedroom where the bathroom is like it's like one of those glass walls where there's a shower and you can just see it. It's not like blocked. The bathroom in our hotel room in Yeah, it's a real It's a real but there's no blocker at all. It's not like a curtain you could draw. And the toilet's in the shower. So, you couldn't do the bed? Yes. The toile There's a wall up there. Well, every shower is a toilet. True, but there's a actual toilet with [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] chitter. And it's weird because the toilet paper just gets wet every time you shower. It's not the greatest design. It's not a great design. Crazy. But I'm sitting there butt ass naked peeing. They went kicked the door down and then I only had a chance to look at them for a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] second cuz I was peeing and I turned back cuz and I went, "What the fuck?" And they went, "Oh my god." Cuz people like to cut through our bedroom cuz it's an easier walk to the backyard. Ah. So that's the only reason they were there. Are you butt ass naked? I'm buttass naked. And they saw you butt assass because there's a wall partition. So all they see is my bare shoulder in the back of my head and my turn body and the knowledge that I'm naked in this room. It's painterly. And you know what they do? What would you do in this situation if I'm you or them? Them. Um my bad. Uh wait. If I was I mean if it's you if I was me in this sit in their place. No no no. If you're them I'd probably If you're you What do you do? [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pee on the floor. What? No. If I was I would Dude, I'd walk in and make fun of you. It'd say, "How's that piss going?" or something like that. Seen you naked. I make it. I I would undoubtedly approach you closer. You are You are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] extra Emily. What they do is they instead of backing away is they open it, they turn and they go, "Ah, we were hoping to cut through. Can we cut through?" And I'm still there. And I'm like, "I guess." And okay, we won't look. And I'm like, "I would hope." And then they just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] walk on through like I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] chopped h. Wait, I feel like they kind of negotiated, right? I I I feel like I don't have a lot of negotiating power. They're negotiating. They're definitely the in the weak. They're negotiating with a weak man here. Yeah. Yeah. I think what you what you do in that spot is you say, "Sure, you can cut through." And then you just start taking a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cuz you're already sitting down. I was going to say you start firing blanks into the toilet. I don't have If you're like putting like like airy farts into the toilet while they're walking by and they're like, "I don't have that ready to go." Like deal with it. Extra Emily throws up on herself. Try it. Try it, Emily. Try it. Try it. Let's just try this. Lewig keeps knocking over Jackie Chan's wax severed hand that is sitting on the set and I remember why it's here cuz cuz Dr. Noodle Slam and my other friend uh Ben visited this this past weekend and we were Ben's never seen the office before. So, we were showing them around like all the different parts and Noodle Slam picked up this hand downstairs, put his drink in it, like made the hand hold his drink, and then proceeded to spend the next 20, 30 minutes we were at the office drinking his drink with Jackie Chan's hand. Yeah. Right. Yeah. And which you kind of stopped noticing, but I realized that's how this migrated the whole way up. Everything that guy does, you're just like, he's a real doctor. He's a doctor. And I always think about this is like when Dennis knows Mac is going to chew on the pen. I I I you placed it here for Sam. And yeah, I you come in like Sam was here. I bet he enjoyed that. Everybody loved the hand. They they had been hanging out the whole week with Sam's uh fiance. And Sam and Ben are both scuba certified. So they were way they went to the they went to the Channel Islands to go scuba diving and like Catalina Island and while they were here they kept talking about how oh it's like cool. They're workshopping this in the car. It's cool that like I have like this anonymized nickname on the podcast like I'm Dr. Noodle Slam. So like nobody like really knows who I am even though we say Sam half the time anyway. He's like so Ben Ben needs a name like that for the show. And they were they were like so we came up with pedophile Ben. Really? You guys said that pedestal raw guessing. No, I did not know this. I That's crazy. The first thing I thought was pedophile Ben. You said pedophile Ben. So that's how I was so fast to join. I'm already thinking it. You guys literally guess that's great cuz they were like so one of your friends. We need an anonymized name so that nobody knows who Ben really is. Yeah, and but he's easil easily distinguishable from other characters. Pedophile Ben, man. They they like pitched this to me. And and and so what did pedophile Ben get down with? Did he play some mini golf? Pedophile. You should have brought him to CP. You would have loved it then. did crush us at mini golf in Catalina Island. Yeah, he's good at childish games. Yeah, I bet. Get him on some regular golf.

Have 100,000 even played in the NBA? No. Definitely not even close. Yeah, top 100,000. I think what's the MLB like 60 70,000 all time ever? I think it's like 70,000. I feel like you have to be thinking about every person who's played professional basketball ever in like most leagues. Yeah, it might broach a mill. I'm going to say 84,000 people. I don't think there's like a findable number in the baseball in the MLB. Yeah, obviously there's a findable number. MLB you could have a number for sure. Yeah, you could definitely know NBA, but it wouldn't include professional basketball. How many people have played? Oh, you're talking you're talking about [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] minor leagues or or Europe or China. It's not basketball. It's not basketball. People playing with the Tigers play [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] playing. But we we should we the dead fish in the net. We can't talk about it too long cuz I think it annoys people. Pull it up. Uh the what the Yeah, please pull up the picture. I think you got to open a reply. Oh, you click into that for us. So, it's a picture of me when I was bald. It's in this outfit. And I look what I can only describe as like I don't know. Well, you look accurate. I look horror. I look grotesque. I look like Job of the Hut. It's such a I look like Baron Hearkening. You look like a Jonan Vasquez character. So, I actually paid Chubby to make this. Do you know that? Yes. I I forgot. I forgot that I had seen this before. I'm my horrible friend. I got art made of my awesome friend. I have art of Aiden in my house. I'm going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] commission somebody to just draw a picture of like Voli Bear stroking each other off. Oh no. And I'm done. And I'm dead ass not going to show anyone. I'm actually going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do that. I'm going to get a picture of you and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Volibear, not show anyone. You're stroking each other off. We're just jerking each other in this red nasty little bear dick. Yeah. And [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Gwen is guys and she's just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like this like in the cuck chair and she's going stroke it. Yeah, I'm going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] commission that like little piss you off. This is I'm going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] look at that. I'm going to use it for sexual pleasure. I'm not going to tell you when. I'm not even going to tell you how often I do it. I I Dude, okay, while you're here, Zipper, can you go to our The yard Twitter? There's a couple things I want to bring up. Yeah, but one is you I think you lost, man. Jack Black is more famous than show. Oh, because the yard Twitter viewers Well, there's that. Scroll past that first one. Scroll past it and then just go to the poll. Yeah. Uh, so the yard Twitter viewers 17 17,000 people. Show a small number of people. It is, but I think I think it's also big enough to where it matters a little bit. No, because all this data is from the US event. We can't we can't go do this. That's what I said. We can't do this third time. Let me do this a third time. Let me just say this. The only thing I want to say everyone gets one statement. I am going to China and I will interview the Chinese. I will dec I will determine. We got some data on this too, by the way. No, no, no. But I'm going to actually go. Yeah. Some people who have actually gone gave us the data. People who have gone are giving anecdotal data about what they remember. I'm going to go and I'm going to do a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] study cuz I'm going to ask 50 Chinese people. You're right. Oh, so 50 is a a big number and 17,000 is a small number. randomly disperse across 2,500 km. Yes, we would call that a significant data pool. Oh, 50 people in one country. Interesting. Now, what you wouldn't consider a significant data pool is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like white college guys and lesbians. Like, what are we doing? That's it. That's the only people we've interviewed. I love that those are the two like the two people listening to the and there's not a lot of baseball viewers in that group. There's not a lot of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] baseball years in in in that 17,000. Okay. Well, there was also a post there was a post on the subreddit that I actually found really uh enlightening and okay as an Indian it's Jack Black and it's not even close. He says my introduction to Jack Black was Kung Fu Panda in ' 08. He said people that he he does a lot of data. It's writing is like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me too statement because what you said is so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] egregious. And but what he said was he's like, "Dude, Jumanji already clears. I'm going to India as well." Great. I'm going to India with Squeaks and I'll interview 50 Indians. You're going to be proven so wrong. I will find out for real though. And it won't be some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] People that have It's not people who are guessing. It's people who have been to India and China are from India and China. I'm just saying like if you are from China but you're a yard listener, I don't think you're a good demo for the average Chinese citizen. There is something that happened. The yard has been put into a legal battle. Okay. And I hate to be the one to tell you, uh, but I I got to bring this up. So, Zipper, there they sent you two images. Can you bring up the first one for me? So, this is uh this is called Art in the Yard. I think it's in North or South Carolina. North Carolina. It's in North Carolina. Yeah. And it's I think Alex might have been the plug. He might have He might have put them on. Uh and if you if if you look, this is Scroll up. This is our logo. This is the yard logo. The Island Arts Council. The Island Arts Council took our logo. And I I actually did some research. They've been using this since 2022. Wow. For for art in the yard. For art in the yard. And so here's And so what I did is I I I took I had a couple thoughts. I was like, "You know what? This is like an art thing, an art thing." And then I looked on the Facebook page and they have t-shirts. Uhoh. No way. Are in the yard. In the yard. And And usually I'm like, who [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cares? They [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] They typed in the yard. They saw the awesome logo that, you know, we selected out of a bunch of designs that we had commissioned and we built as a logo. I mean, it might not seem like it. It's a little fence and I was like, you know what, whatever. He's picked it. But then I thought, isn't it due diligence of an art festival to make their own logo? You you would hope. You would hope. And well, and then do it for 3 years. Now, there's many legal courses of action here. There's a lot. And and they they would be simple routes. Might I propose something else? Sure. They're using what clearly seems to be like a downloaded version. It's kind of low res. It's overlapping. We reach out to them. We send them a high-res version that they can use, but watermarked. Not even watermarked. Really subtly. Well, just like barely. I think you're thinking what I'm thinking. Almost imperceptible. You couldn't even notice it from afar. Like so far away you would even boom. It's just swatsa in the yard. It's North Carolina, man. I don't know. They're like, "Why does this logo look cooler?" There's something about it's like I don't know. I didn't like it before. I like it now, though. The yard generalizes south again. Well, what I think what happens is I think people go to Google and they type yard logo because they're a yard themed thing. Of course, cuz this happens actually a decent amount. People see yard logo, but that that that as my idea still is lararseny. We changed the podcast name to McDonald's. So, you're more stolen. Guys, guys, guys, this is this is all fine and good, but I've already proposed and launched. You've launched it. I've launched a solution. So, my terms to the Island Arts Council is one is two things. One, just change it. Make your own logo. You're an arts council. You can do it. Uh, two, submit my art for your festival, right in perpetuity to be displayed at every arts council meeting. Yes. And if Zipper, you could show them the art piece that I made. Wow. And it's a dribbling. Not dribbling. Not dribbling. Arcing. It's an arcing. Why is the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so thin? We're looking at a We're looking at a Why is it curved hard drawn dick shooting ropes? And I want to say it's pencil thin. It's more like confetti than It's not pencil thin. It is pencil. Why would you say pencil thin? Why are you getting offended? It's just a thing you drew. It's not girthy. It's not based off anything. It's not girthy. Well, it's not girthy. No, it's not girthy. But I wouldn't say pencil thin. But it's not pencil thin. I mean I mean I mean you're you're doing this you're doing you're doing this and it's cir it is cir which I I I think I take artistic you know issue with that well look it doesn't seem inclusive the artist is the artist if you wanted to draw one for the island arts council actually they should take all of our art with you so anyway there should be a center where there's four easels and roses on the ground like a yeah like a shrine I think we should make one of the Island Arts Council members enter the race to gold. Oh my god, they would never do it. Some 45year-old woman and they're amazing. A 39year-old son. So did you Susan? So did you reach out to them? Like did you emailed it on the Instagram and I said here's your two options. You said it like you said it like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mafia member. Yeah. I said like level 99 crime two [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] options. I was like I was like this is the show for our web series. We can do this the easy way or the hard way. That's so awesome. They're making t-shirts with our damn logo on it. See, I saw the t-shirts and I was like, "Okay, hold on. We should go. We should I want to see the t-shirts. I want to see that logo on a Heather Gray shirt. It's just Is it literally just the logo? Is it the whole like art in the yard? It's the It's like the the colorful background and then the yard logo and it's Heather Gray. That is an ugly shirt. Wait, we should steal their design. We should just sell it. We should just sell their shirt. The best idea ever. This is I like this idea. Let's steal it and and put it on. They can't do literally anything. I I don't know how that works. No. No. It We're They stole our logo. Yeah. Yeah. But you enter it cuz like what's that guy's name? The guy who used to just steal [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all the time. Uh Pedo Ben. Pedo Ben. Is this not Is this Is this not the art equivalent of when we stole your truck back? When we found it in the street with like when Slime found it in the street with nobody in it and we just stole the truck back to get back. It's street justice. No. No. that it's street justice for sure. I'm just thinking of the there's the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] there's a famous law case where it's the guy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what's his name? He like takes art and he like puts on logos. It's like the Campbell logo. Oh. Oh. Um no no he's talking he's talking at Warhol. Warhol. Andy Warhol. Andrew Warhol had a court case cuz he got sued for taking people's logos. Uhhuh. And won the court case because he had changed it enough. Transformative. Transformative. We This is not the legal grounds ours is in at all. But no, no. I'm saying their what if theirs is considered transformed because they have an ugly transform logo. Isn't the logo the exact same though? The Campbell logo. Look at Andy Warhol. I'm saying this is it's tougher than it is. It's entirely different color scheme. I think Lwig as a uh there it's worth, you know, it's it's not as cut and dry as no, they didn't transform it. That's Prince uh there's been Warhol Campbell. Um, also he used the can, not the logo in his art. Is there no logo in because the the Campbell's logo is the Campbell's the the text. He just drew a can of soup. He drew the the colorful cans of soup. I don't know [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about art. I'll say that much. I don't know a damn thing. Damn. That was art back in the day, huh? Yeah. He's like 1962. I just did acid. That is like the dumbest painting ever. What's sick is that he did it again in ' 68. Like he ran it back. Yeah. I I know I know of like the colorful one on the left side there, top left. Like I know of that when I think of Look at the one that's just actually dead ass like repeating logo. Yeah. Yeah. That he has a lot of repeating stuff too. I don't know if any of these are original. Which one's original or not? I think the top left the Momo one for sure. Oh yeah, probably Momo. One time Lewig made fun of me when we first started hanging out cuz I said that like we were working on something. I was like this is these are like dumb um like normie jokes. And he's like, "Whatever, Warhol." And I was like, "All right, I think I understand this guy." Don't reference. This is uh I never noticed till right now that it's all the flavors. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This guy's just into soup. This guy's just really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hungry at the grocery. Hungry into soup. He's just writing down all of them. Soup. That's what happens when you're really hungry. Bean. Bean soup. It's the only one that's Well, I'm down. Let's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it. Let's make the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] merch. I'm not going to get into a lawsuit with him if that's where we can make it we can make it one to one and just sell it for like Can we just release it in this episode? What What if we make it one to two? What if it What if it cuz the Island Arts Council? What if we change one word? Oh god. They shouldn't They shouldn't have been an island. Yeah. Wow. I'm just saying what if it's the FC Island Art Console? Wow. We can't sell that shirt. I guess we should we can sell a shirt and whatever we want to sell next to the FC Island Arts Council Arts Council, but island is in quotes. That's weird. It's more subtle. Anyway, yeah, it sucks. It sucks to wake up to news like that. So, go ahead, click this link down below if you'd like to buy this shirt island shirt. Nope, don't know. It supports it supports the arts. We're going to change lose the arts. They're going to see this part in the clip and we're going to lose the last Come at us, North Carolina. I know Mr. Beast. It would be really easy to make the the yard symbol a symbol of hate and then their event would forcefully need to change their It's a symbol of that would suck. That's like Archer. Uh the company's called ISIS and they just had to change it. Yeah, it sucks to suck. Do you think maybe they got it from that uh from the from the like ISIS got it from Archer? Maybe. H it's an acronym. They were watching and they're like, "Dude, this shit's awesome." Unless it stood for like the Islamic State of whatever. Yeah, it was the same stands for uh ISIS fell off. ISIS fell off. ISIS fell off crazy. You don't hear about ISIS did not fell off did not fell off. ISIS did not fell off. Whatever. You know, also fell off. I thought about pigs in a blanket doing their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] When was the last time you were at any sort of party and someone had made pigs in a blanket? I've had pigs in a blanket within the last year. No, you have not. Actually, cutie definitely makes kids pigs in a blank. That's what she pigs in a blanket. That's some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that she'd be like, she makes it at least once a year. We had these at Easter type. Yeah. I've haven't eaten pigs in a blanket in a long time.

Uh, how can good guys are be down when there's more Chinese people than ever? What is that you're saying? What does that even mean? What are you compensating for? Okay. Oh, they're not good guys. No, that's not good or bad inherently because of where they're from. I think based off toyed around with these ideas and we're so far from I think you're good or bad based off where you're from. And I'm down to go country for country right now. I was going to say like we we could really test this one. Running through China. You're all such good people. I love you. Shusha. What about Algeria? How do you feel about Algeria? Frenchman. Not the hottest on it. Wow. It was Beckistan. Love it. Huh? Yuck. Actually, the worst. Yeah. The worst. Yeah. I would call it the Epstein nation. Yeah. My god. Epste. All right. Uh, speaking of Aiden, uh, hating dogs in coffee shops, we were at a coffee shop, me and Cutie. Yeah. And there was a lady in line. Mhm. And uh and her husband is looking for a seat and he kind of reminded me of the guy who was really sad and pathetic from office space. The stapler guy. Oh yeah, my stapler. He was like that guy. And he was looking around. He's like there's no spots in the back, but maybe I'll look in the front. And so he's doing that and he's wearing shorts. And Huh? He's wearing shorts. He's wearing like cargo shorts. Yeah. Yep. This is how every offline TV viewer looks in real life. He They're 50 and I rest my case. Okay. And he goes to the front of the cafe and and and a dog barks at him. There's like a dog tucked under his women's leg. How big? And it's it was like literally in a cubby. It's maybe an Italian greyhound. Okay. Kevin, small dog. Small dog. And it barks at him like a couple times. And then uh and then he walks back to the line and the lady who was ordering uh hears this, right, his wife. And he goes, "You allow dogs in here?" And then and then the lady behind the counter goes, "Yeah, yeah, we allow dogs." And she goes, "Hm, let's see if the health code likes that." Oh, Aiden was there. And then and then and then the lady kind of stun unlocks. She stops answering and she goes, "Yeah, I think I'll call them up and we'll see about that." And then and then and then this whole interaction I am looking at the calories of orange juice. I haven't noticed a thing. You're like, "That's a lot." And I'm like I'm literally thinking that. And cutie who only eaves drops on conversations and ignores me to eaves drop [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] chimes in and goes she goes you'll be all right. And she chimes in. Yeah. She chimes in. She goes, "You'll be all right." And lady goes the lady goes thank you. And she's like, "Yeah, you'll live." And she's like And she goes and she goes, "Thank you." And then they have this little back and forth. They have a little tiff. They have a little tiff. And I And I only hear the tiff. I'm like And I'm like, you chime in. Nasty tiff. Ladies, the orange juice is out of control, do you? Maybe we just stick to the fruit. Sugar, this many calories. Uh, and then and then the lady who who was ordering, she goes she goes, "You know what? You guys can go ahead of us." And I and I'm and I'm the one who's going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] order. And I go, "No." Okay. What is going on in white people? And then she just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] she goes, "You know what? Fine." And then just leaves. Whoa. And she just leaves. No order. No order. And her husband follows. And then you get her husband 100% follows. Uh large legs. Huh? You got a large orange juice. And then I get the orange juice and I let her I let Cutie know. I'm like it's got a lot of sugar in it. I'm going to eat this. I'll be hyper all day. Damn. That lady is uh But that's But that's that's one of your people. That's one of your people. That's the same. In the moment I realized I was like cutie is the defender against Aidens around the world. Cuz as soon as you do as soon as you do what that lady's doing, it's like you're doing the only thing worse than bringing your dog into that coffee shop. Make it a stink. Making a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stink. So you you're saying get rid of the dog quietly. Yeah. If I'm If I'm her, I look the cashier in the eyes. I give her I flash my minty fresh smile and then I go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] choke the dog out in the back. You say you say, "Give me one second." [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pull out. like, "Yeah, can I get an ice latte?" And he's just unwrapping a Hershey's bar. Oh my god. I had almost the exact I I I reaffirmed my belief in this this week because I've been walking around different neighborhoods in LA and the sidewalks are just they're just covered in dog [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Oh, that's your issue with the sidewalks. They're covered in dog [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Really? What's your issue with the sidewalks? My issue with the sidewalks is twofold. One, it it they don't have them like handicap accessible in many areas. That's true. In the sense that it doesn't go from like a like a raised sidewalk into like a slope. Do you use a wheelchair when you get around? I I need to be disabled to be considerate of them. Some sidewalks have jumps. That's bad. It's It's a high elo [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sidewalk. You just have to It's just harder. Okay, good. I don't know what to tell you, dude. Your wheelchair up the gap. Alway the wheelchair up the gap. like it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] skate. If you can't do uh if you can't do four steps with your wheelchair, it's like why? How long have you even been doing it? Okay, they need some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all terrain tires on the My second issue is the trees that were planted were not planted with the consideration that they'll grow and the roots take over the sidewalk. Those are cool. I always like when it breaks out. It's like beautiful, right? And then you have those sidewalk nature fighting back. That's Oh, that's also cool. It's like by the sandwich shop we go to where it's like all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. It looks like a movie. Why is you guys are I I don't know. I think it's awesome. I don't know. You think it's awesome? That's cool because it's like Whoa, Fall Guys. Again, bad for people in wheelchairs. Uh, sure. But their life is bad, right? They're always looking. There's always a That's why we have laws that are supposed to make it better. Sure, man. I think that's it's a great initiative and you could talk to your city council about it, but you never will. It's already a law. Well, then you need to get their ass to court. I speed all the time. It's the law not to do that. You speed all the time. Actually, I don't. I hate speeding, but I break a lot of laws. I have a gun. You know, my problem is with sidewalk is that the kids who do the hopscotch in my neighborhood, they make it too hard. It's like really long. Like they're going to like like a hundred. They're not account for your knees. And I walk by I have OCD. I got to do the I got to do the hopcotch. I do the hopscotch. We walk by. I do the hopscotch. Yeah. Yeah. The kid put it on the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ground. I'm not going to not do the hopscotch. I'm not kidding. They're going to 100 these days. 100's brilliant. That's good. The circles are like this big. I think I like that the kids have enough concentration and willpower to make it go to 100. It's the same issue we have in video games where like the skill floor is so high that it's hard to enjoy hopscotch anymore. We've been pushing We've been silently pushing the the skill floor of hopscotch all these years. The hopscotch met is going crazy now. My girlfriend does it. She does it wrong. I'm like, "Go again. Got to go." I don't let her go. We can't go past this point. Go again. Whiplashing your girlfriend. Yeah. Not not quite my tempo. She's like, I have a meeting. I have a call in like 5 minutes. And you're like, well, you shouldn't have lost on 27. Nick from the yard [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me. What? I didn't do that. Yes, you did. What do you mean I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you? How? I Why did he get the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I I was doing a video where I watched different YouTubers and then I bought whatever ad they promoted. Yes, I did this. I actually did this. And Adam Regusia, Adam Regusia, I love that guy. Lovely guy. Lovely man has a Helix Sleep sponsorship. Oh, Helix Sleep. I have a Helix and mattress actually. And I and I and I I don't have I don't actually just have one. And you know, funny enough. How many do you have? Three. Interesting. Yeah. Because what I needed to do for the sponsor was try every product. So when I reached out to Helix Sleep, I said, "Could I could we cash in on one of the mattresses?" Yeah. I I reached out actually and said, "Lwig would like one." And I put it in my guest room. Yeah, that's what they said. They said, "Lwig, we've already sent you your mattress." I said, "Lwick the YouTuber." So, I had to I had to do the sleep quiz, which was enjoyable of process to be honest, and I had to order my own mattress. Now, the only [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] good news is that first off, the sleep quiz gave me the exact mattress I wanted cuz it was very comfortable. You get Midnight Lux. I got Midnight Lux, not Elite. That's what No, Midnight Lux. That's what I ordered for you to my house. That's so funny. That's so exact. He's like, he's so thoughtful. Yeah. Well, it's not thoughtful because you want to come stay at my house. You can be cozy for my house. You don't go to Nick's house very often. You're always about possessions. Like you you possess uh you know the memory foam cooling features. You possess sleep zones. Yes. Yeah. I want to possess a sleep zone that's different for me and my girlfriend because she likes it soft. Do you like it hard? I like it hard and she likes it soft. What a flip on the classical dynamic. Well, anyway, if you like it soft, hard, or anything in between, I want to say go to helixleep.com/adamriggusia no which is the code I use it would work great for him that would work great even better though is the yard uh helixleep.com/theard 25% off sitewide love and adamusi I think he's actually 24% I actually was able to get a midnight lux mattress for 1300 with free shipping using helixleep.com [Music] link so they know the yard sent us never use the yards link otherwise they'll think link will lose the sponsor. I don't know if this link you helix.com/25 is out for Helix Sleep. Maybe they don't care. I've never used this link. It could work. It couldn't work. I do know Adams for sure works cuz I bought it with my own money. Use our link. Use our link so that they know that they are saying you actually put both links on the screen and let them choose. Put both. You can choose which one you want to use. Leave it to the masses. Which one's harder to spell? Oh, and the pillows are also great. All right. My beautiful girlfriend was she she had deleted Tik Tok off of her phone. Whoa. But she guilty watches YouTube shorts, which is, you know, the same [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right? No, it's not the same [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] It's not the same in quality, but it's and and so she doesn't like when I look over her shoulder to see what's on her feet. She's very sensitive about me backsaving whatever her algorithm is, right? So, I take a I take a peek. What are you watching? And then Zipper, can you pull it up in the chat? She's watching this video and she's like crying, laughing out of like the combined interest and shame she has that I think she's engaged with this video. Ranking AI toast spreads. Oh my god. And it's an AI video where there's like aluminum balls being spread on a beautifully buttered piece of toast. And it's AI and it looks great. Like I got a complete sound too. It looks really good. Am I Am I wrong about this? Yeah, it looks It looks good. It looks What's that? I don't like this one. I don't like the clouds one. Oh, you don't like the clouds one? I don't like the noise they make. I don't like the I like the diamonds. I like the diamonds. Oh my god. You know how usually in these AI video Oh, the galaxy. That's the galaxy. Yo, that actually is fire. Wow, dude. AI videos are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Love egg. Love AI toast spreads in bed next to me. You know how you know how the people those like men go insane and talk to Chachi PT like it's gone and they kill their whole family. She's just going to do that to you. I know. Which is like makes it way more cool. She had this up. She scrolled to the next video with something like this and then she just deleted the app. You shamed her. YouTube you too. She deleted YouTube. I do think YouTube is deletable now. I think Shorts has made it deletable. No [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Look, man, there's a lot of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] YouTube is the worst right now. Michael was going I Michael's solution was crazy cuz he was I think he was coding he was making something for his phone. Yeah, he was trying to code something that would block YouTube shorts from appearing on his only blocked shorts. So, he could still boot up YouTube because he needs to see it for like work, but he couldn't open or view shorts. Maybe it's the siren call like it just doesn't work on my ears. Maybe it's like when Fry has the he's his own grandfather so he doesn't have the brain wave in Futurramama. Yeah. So he's not affected by it. But I I I watch YouTube every single day on my phone. Eat lunch with YouTube sleep but with a video going and I've never shorts do not enter my world. You never crack. Well, you know how this is the real test is when you open the app and you're at the top of the recommended sheet. Is it shorts first or long form videos? Here's the problem. I'll watch a short like once every couple weeks like a fighting game short. It's like how to how to do a leverless input with Ryu and then they'll keep feeding they they really push it. They It makes me mad because they they switch it over and it's like I didn't want it to become like that. I wanted it to be my beautiful long form videos. They're like right away you want the shorts, right? And I'm like and if you do it on browser it does the same thing. And I just scroll past them and the algorithm takes the hint. I'm 35. Do you watch Tung Tung Sahur? What is that? My goat. Anyone? My My fork going down the garbage disposal. Zipper, can you look up Tung Sahur? Zipper. Zipper's making grown noises. Grown. Just look up. It's so hard out there. On YouTube shorts. Yeah, shorts. Videos. Click any short. Click any back. Is this like beos? Click literally any short. He looks he's he's Oh, we got a short We got an ad on a short, dude. This a political ad. This can't be real, man. And it's we're embedded into Google. I don't like this. What was the name of that guy who lied? Gavin Gilis. Gailos. Dude, those AI figures are all deformed. It It's so gross. They're all facing away from the DJ. Wait, wait, pause. This is not the one I was thinking of. Uh, this is the guy though. This is uh this is what the youth is consuming. I look up the Rizzler Italian brain lot brain rot. We're just we're revisiting brain rot quiz. This is kind of making me realize like kids just like repetitive dumb [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Like this is what cartoons were to like you know boomers. Yeah, this video this video blew my mind. This made me realize because this is the brightest of the youngest generation audio. You get all 10 right, you win. Okay. Who is this? That's two for two. Bombardo. That's three. Cappuccino. That's six. [Music] Seven. I don't know the name. Oh, I appreciate you're playing. Yeah. Get the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of here, bro. You just dabbed a 10-year-old. Yeah. What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is going on? It's the Rizzler. It's the Rizzler. He's the brightest of the youngest generation and he's naming Italian AI brain rod characters like you would, you know, starters on a basketball team. And he's dressed like 2010 Tower of the Creator. Yes. Cats on everything. Cats on everything. Panel. Um, anyway, that's that's the YouTube shorts side. I feel like YouTube shorts is what creates that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] That [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] does not exist on reals in Tik Tok to the same degree. You're saying YouTube shorts is worse than Tik Tok. It's the worst. Yeah. I don't understand how it encourages that. No, that shit's not on Tik Tok. Like Tik Tok is like Tik Tok is the one that starts the raptures today. That's Tik Tok. I I think is it human input? Like is it like Tik Tok is people talking to their phones and uploading videos? Yes. Tik Tok is like people doing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and like Tik Tockers and then reals is like random people capturing a video of some crazy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happening and maybe people dying and then like slurs in the comments and then YouTube shorts is like AI curated videos from anonymous [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] channels to get your attention. Shorts has the most AI. Yes, I think so. I I that I I don't know how to describe it. There's the one male AI voice that's really popular for narration right now, Brian. And maybe and as soon as I hear that guy's voice, no matter what the content is, I click out. I'm like, I can't I don't want to listen to this. Nasty. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] take cuz it's always like a 15 like or minute long video. How about you just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] narrate it? Like just grow up and narrate it. Well, the the the reason is cuz an SM7B costs money. You don't even need that. You don't even need this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] talk. They'll take it off, man. You're not gonna put it back on. It's actually Nick's right. I discovered uh like I've been doing this video where I do different YouTuber sponsors and Eric was sponsored, maybe he owns it, but there's some company called like Clipper and you use it either as an individual to pay for people to clip your content or if you want to clip other people's content to make money. And it's basically like like Fiverr but just for clips. Yes. Kind of. And it's like a but it's an automated process where you submit your clip if it gets approved. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Scuba Ryan is using basically. Yeah. Yeah. And if you know that's where you like see the stake logo. It's kind of like that you know but done through a more official process. Uh so I tried using it but as the clipper. Uh except the issue is when you're new they don't give you a lot of opportunities. So, the only one was for like the founder of the company and the only YouTube videos he had are on this like 2,000 subscriber channel about how it works. So, I just made a video and I submitted it and it was it was just footage of him and then spliced with the jail footage of Epstein. And and you did this in your free time? Yeah, I did this in my free time and I haven't made a dime yet off of it. It has zero views on Tik Tok. Dude, it's like when it was like the CEO of Ford has a podcast and he had like Sydney Sweeney on there. It's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that. It is. It would be like having to clip from that. And it's so much harder than clipping from stable Ronaldo. Oh, you know. Well, Ron generates timeless moments. They call him the clip. He's fun for the whole family. Is he for half your family? He's fun for a quarter of your He's He's fun if you have one person in your family maybe who likes it. He's fun for one person in your family doesn't hang out at Thanksgiving. Yeah. And who who you want to come down? You say, "Wow, you came out of the gate." Where is What do you think Ron will be when he's 35? That's a great question. I think about it. I think he'll be off the internet. Why? Cuz I think he'll be off the internet cuz he'll have made enough money. I think he'll be a DJ. I think you're wrong. Oh, I think you're wrong. No, I think he'll be like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] off the internet real estate guy. Real? No, he'll own a bunch of property. Oh, but he Okay. Okay. He'll be I'll own a bunch of property. He'll he'll have eight figures. He'll have a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] wife and kid and he'll be living in Florida. All these people yearn for the minds, bro. That's what I'm realizing as we as we get further along into this is that I I that never it feels like most of the time that doesn't happen. Like if you have a young career of some kind and you forfeit kind of that time period in your life where you would have a more traditional social experience like maybe you would have gone to college and you wouldn't have been like rich and famous yet. you like as soon as you forfeit that, I feel like when the steam starts running out, you try to go do something else, but they just fall back to something that's adjacent or or something to do without putting entertainment again because they don't really know where else to go. In his case, he might always have enough money that it literally doesn't matter anymore. Mario Lopez. Uhhuh. He's just on random [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Yeah. like hotel only TV shows. Well, he's just hotel only TV show. Yeah. Yeah. Like the tuby of like closed circuits. It'll be It'll be like America's Best Biker, but it's just like I'm hosting it. Here it is. There's a bunch of bikers. That's just a guy who works though. I guess that's just work. But But he's saying like he's What's Ryan Serest doing? Working. He be doing the same [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Doesn't he still do the radio? Yeah, he's still doing the radio. Kiss 108. That's like has been his main [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for so long. Oh, I remember there was that quote from uh from Brennan Frasier. Did I say this on the yard or just with Nick? But it was like he he was saying someone asked him after the whale came out cuz he's like kind of back in action and he's like they were like, "Would you would you ever be in an Avengers movie? Would you ever be a superhero?" He's like, "Yes, I'm an actor. I I want to work." And it's like that simple. Yeah. I want work. This is my job. Which is kind of funny cuz it's like But I think it's different when you self-publish, I guess, like when you're like a streamer or YouTuber. Maybe. I mean, maybe you're right in the sense that like they don't care about the success that comes with it. They just really love creating, but I think with Ron, he just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cared about the moola. I think it's falling back on like familiarity. That's what I have. People still need like a a work or like a routine, right? So, the people I imagine in my head, right? There's a I know this seems like a silly example, but take Hugs from Melee, right? Yeah. He he by the time he became like a professional gamer, he had like he I think he had like a CPA, he had like worked a normal job for a long time and then he makes this like conscious decision that he's going to go be professional gamer, try content and do this for like years and years and years, right? But when that when the steam out of esports runs out, you know, when the Voodoo Ranger when the Voodoo Ranger, I will say he did a good job. He's the number one ambassador for that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] He he he has like a background and an understanding that okay, I need to go pursue some sort of like new education or like go back to regular work and I know what that's like and I'm going to go do that. Whereas I think if you spend, you know, age 16 to like 25, you know, popping off on TikTok and skipping like school and like kind of that period of time where you might be introduced to your first real job and then the steam runs out. Even if you have a bunch of money, it's hard to imagine what you would even turn to. So, you just kind of settle and like go back to something familiar, even if it's publishing YouTube videos to people that only 10,000 or 5,000 people watch instead. Like Rice Gum. I don't think he's doing that. Well, he's making videos, is he? Uh, every now and then. Uh, he had a kid, though. He had a kid. Well, okay. There's an inherent shame and and not not from my perspective, but I think from the world's perspective of like the the young streamer, right? And it's like everyone kind of knows this is like this thing that shouldn't last forever in the in the idea that if if stable Ronaldo I love how he's example here is doing this when he turns 30 being stable Ronaldo and hasn't sort of changed to do like different content or be a different type of person there will be he will get clowned in a way that is like what are you doing bro and that's interesting but I also think there there's also a side of this that in his case, right? If he makes a bunch of money and saves some of it and he's in that spot and, you know, he's 35 still publishing the YouTube videos to no viewers, but he has a you know, he's totally secure in his future. You know, who gives a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] He wants to keep making if you want to keep making the videos for 5,000 people. Like, well, you might as well just not be you might as well just be like woodworking in your garage at that point cuz it's just like But this is your woodworking. Sure. Exactly. Yeah. And it could be. It could be. But I think it's there's also there's also Canners. Yeah. People who just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] get up and damn leave. I think there's a big part of this that's attention though. Like you spend a lot of your life having a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ton of attention. Like you every time you look at your phone, if you turn it away and turn it back, you have more notifications. And then one day, let's just say that stops or it's slower. I think that you don't just go great. Like I think you're like oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] no one cares about me anymore. And like you seek the attention more. Yeah. Do you do that? I think that's probably what I'm saying. What I'm saying about Ron and I think some people is that they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they turn it and they go okay and they move on. That's I I think that's awesome. Anyone who can do that. I think I I'm just struggling to think of any examples I can think of people who have picked up walked away given it all up that weren't older when they started that weren't already like in their mid20s when they started. And I think C9ers was, wasn't he? No. Am I wrong? Yeah. Yeah, he started. I mean, for us, I guess he seemed cuz he's older than us. I guess cuz he's always been He started to have been in his mid20s when he started. I I think he was in his very low. Is he not like How old is he now? How old is Canders now? He's got to be like 30. You look up 38. I I'm I'm saying but he started in like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 200 2009. So I don't know the math. I'm not smart enough. 16 years ago. So, he was 25. Yeah, that's kind of what I'm saying. I There might be an good answers to this, by the way. But I'm just trying I I can't think of anybody who became like a gigantic streamer between the ages of 16 and 20 who like Well, because not enough time, man. Not enough time. Shut up. Don't make good points. Like, you're you're basically saying like there Yeah. Yeah. No one's there yet. No, but a lot of people used to be, you know, you could be 16 to 20 like starting uh starting 10 15 years ago. These guys, look, one day all these guys will either turn 35 or they won't. They'll die. And what happens with everybody? It does. It does. It's true. 35. Everybody either dies or makes it to 35. Specifically, one of them won't make it. And we can't tell. We can't tell you who it is. Dark. We can't tell. It's a secret industry secret. It's funny cuz people will like people in chat will say that like, "Dude, you're 35, lol." And I'm like, "Either you're going to get here one day or you won't." So, I don't know what to tell you. Anyway, like when you in that those 10 15 years or whatever, they're going to look back on Northern Lion and be like, "He figured it out. It's a schedule. It's it's it's easy. It's entertaining. It's influential and it's conducive to a real life." And I think the Northern Lion, what do you call it? Structure or or like format is kind of like the holy grail of all of this. Yeah. I think some people would be like that. I think adapt will do that. Those are the most interesting people to me are the people that do figure it out, right? Like the the Dubbins and the Hank Greens and the and the Philip DeFranco. They like they kind of Sorry, you just been locked in. Oldest [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] people on YouTube. No, no. I I think it's crazy for a different reason. Hank Green and Philip DeFranco. What? Older YouTubers who have had long story careers and they've managed to through thick and thin. They've managed to maintain thick still thick and they've stayed thick through most of this. My career is like half as long as all of them. I I think the difference I was blown away for a different reason is because I don't see Hank Green going up to Jason the Wii and then starting to talk like a 20-year-old Zoomer. Yeah, but that's different. And that's cuz you don't hang out with Hank Green offline. Yeah. Yeah, man. It's like, hey, hey, what do you think about robots? He's like, "Nah." Uh, you know, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] clad man. Is that how that's how green talks offline? Yeah. Me and me and Hen Green listen to steel pulse in the car. The galaxy is expanding. What he say? Probably. He says that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] That Lwig has this thing where if I like lose in lane, I think he really tries to when I'm streaming, he really really tries to like salvage it and which which I would argue I'm just bad. I'm not necessarily as tilted as you might think. I'm just going to do the same decision no matter what. But I'll like die and then he'll be like, "I just want to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] let you know in chat. I want to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] let you know I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] love you like a brother. I love you in ways that I don't love anybody else." He'll say like really meaningful [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I'll I'll just read it and I'll just roll my eyes in any other context. I'd be like, "This is really special." And then and then he's tried to do other he's tried to gift subs. Yeah. I'll die in lane and I'll see five bomb come through and I'm like don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do that. I do it to both you guys. I'm a I'm a big supporter. You are a big supporter. It makes me It feels good to know that my friends watch I'm I'm not dropping away. I'm not Dropper. We need some YouTube shorts on your games. Please, if someone wants to make I love the moment. We need the the moments of you talking to chat. Of course. That's the most interesting game. I listen to the the Sona files. Oh, you like that? I wanted to talk about that so bad. I was actually saving it for the primo. Yeah, that guy's great. Me and Shake play normals every night. It's our little routine. We'll message you each other and go, "Husband." And then uh he just runs it down. It's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] miserable. Oh my god. We did VOD review the other day cuz I got pissed at him cuz he he was drunk on Saturday night. He comes home. He's like, "You want to play a game or two?" My drunk husband comes home. My drunk husband. He's like feeling frisky and I'm like, "Okay." And we play a game and he [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up this moment in the game. And I'm like, "You [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] suck. Shake. I don't want to play with you anymore. You come home drunk." And I was like, "You hit it belly to belly, no motion." And he was like, he was drunk. But he's still playing well cuz he's good at the game. And he's like, "Oh, that is a 50/50. That is a 50/50. And you're stupid." He shake holds his ground pretty well. And I'm like, "That's not a 50-50. You're an asshole." So, we go into the VOD and we we start watching the replay. He's like, "Oh my god, I'm so vindicated. You're so stupid." And I'm like losing. I'm mad. But he doesn't care. Shake will just tell me how it is. He's like, "I'm vindicated. This is how it is. You're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stupid." And Mike is just sitting there in the call just like, "Did I do something wrong?" Mike hates arguing. This is This is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] And he doesn't have to care, right? Because he's master diamond, too. He's getting there. I also I I said I was like I always defend you on this podcast cuz he keeps sending me updates. He's like I was like for when it comes to burgers, I'm your nemesis, but on on League I always defend how good you are. I think I think it's funny cuz like I always defend you on this podcast and it's only in the context of League of Legends, but every other mention of Shake is like how you want how you like punch a picture of his face in your backyard on the punching bag because it's objective truth. It's objective truth. Anyway, we're playing these games and uh but yeah, we get into a game with this guy and he plays Sona and he shakes bot lane and he's just like, "This is the worst player I've ever played with." And I'm like, "Ah, whatever. It's a normal." And then the guy is just really chatty and we're just talking. It's back and it's not very It's not flaming at all, but he's so interesting in the game. I'm like, "Can I interview you after this?" And he's like, "Everyone always says that and they never take me up on it." And I was like, "Of course he says that. I promise I will take you up on it. Yeah, we we pulled into a lobby and I talked to this guy and he was it's on my YouTube channel. Dude, it's sad. It's a sad video. Uh I don't I think it's as sad as people think. It's not because of his life. It's sad because the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] comment he left. It's like a he found it 12minute video. He finds this video. Yeah, because Slime told him about his channel. Uh, I asked him if I could post it, too. And it's this 39year-old guy and he calls himself the Sona guy and he talks about like he talks about League poetically. He's like he only plays Sona, which is not a very good character, not a very popular character, but she used to be good. And he goes he he goes, "I went through war with her. Would you leave your comrade if you went through war with your comrade?" Season five and six, we saw [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I've never seen before. Like I do like talking about season cuz that's a little how I feel when I watch you guys play League. It's like back in season 3 it was different, right? We didn't have all these new fangled tools like and I like I literally like I see a scary future cuz he talks about it and he's and he's like you know you guys are like what's your peak rank and he's silver now and and he's been playing the game like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 10 years a lot of games based off his his mastery and he and you're like what is his peak rank? And he's like, I was going for gold promos and I and my friends has to play with me. So what do I say? Yes, I'm a good friend and they're bad and I can't carry them. But then I get to the final game and he's like recalling this game from almost 10 years ago. Like such a vivid detail like it happened yesterday and and basically the end result is he choked a Baron call and didn't win his gold promo and he has never hit gold. and and he talks about that moment like it broke him and now he said he had a mental breakdown and now and and now he refuses to try to rank up but he said he was like I tutor master players. He does say that which is great and me and Shake Shake is so funny cuz his volume is really low in the VOD for some reason and he's just laughing cuz he's like I'm we're not laughing at this guy. We're just talking to him and Shake's just like what do you tell them? Yeah, what do you tell the master player? And it's it's such an interesting response from Shake who is very good and he's just listening to a guy who's been silver for 10 years be like, "No, you guys play completely wrong. You should you should duo that guy to gold. That'd be great." What What did that guy Yeah. getting after this is over getting him to gold. Saving that Sona guy. Saving private Sona guy. And but anyway, the the thing that is sad is Z. I don't know if you can pull up Slime's YouTube. Oh, I can read the comment. Oh, yeah. Do you have it? He said, so he he he's goes the video and I pinned it. He said, "Hello, everyone." Smiley face. Bracket reads the comments. Oh. Oh dear. Well, it ended the way I figured. By the way, in this video, I am not flaming the guy. I just You're not. He's interesting. And I said I appreciate him. And I was like relating to him because I'm old, too. And he's like, "Well, it ended the way I figured colon and then just a line." Yeah. And then he said, "At least some of them were dot dot dot close to being nice. The internet really is what it is." Which is fine, though. I wish I had more time in the interview. I could probably explain things in greater context. More time. And here it is. And it's a lot of people just being really nice to him. I think in the replying to him. Yeah. I I think most like there's a lot of comments. Okay. So sad. Can Can I maybe actually You know what? I'm saving it for the primo. If you want to hear my thoughts, save come in the Primo. Wait, why save it? Huh? cuz we don't have much time left. We got damned like 15 minutes. Is that true? Yes. No, we don't. Said no. Do you have 5 minutes worth? You know what? We could league. I realized I realized that my life my life starts to crumble when you guys get into League cuz Yeah, because instead of League week with you, which we know is bad, it's league it's league week with you two and it doesn't end. And it doesn't end. I haven't been responding. No, about the about the trip. We haven't talked about it at all. Look, like like we asked all day yesterday. I'm reading this group chat where Aiden's like, "Hey guys, would just love to carve a tie to some time cuz we're not doing the pod today to talk about because I already said I already I said, "Hey, I'm down for whatever we want to do." No, it's all good. It's all good. You I'm waiting for the chancellors. He asked to meet in person. We'll meet in person. But I I understand that it's a big chunk of our time and I myself am pretty burnt out. I remember yesterday I understand you're in the war cuz I was I in a war with Voli Bear and I know his ones and zeros. What are you talking You're in a war with yourself, brother. Shut the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. Voli Bear's not a part of this war. I think I feel like I feel like a like a a a a dog who just like takes the little bits of food he could get right now because it's like a it's it's a it's actually in this order in terms of little bits of available time that that puppy gets while his papa plays league. And it's like with you it was virtually none even through even through a crisis week. Yeah. And then with you it's it's slightly more than Lwig gave during that time. And then with you it's the most out of the three. So it's like a papa is like papa's like it's better than it was in December. Yeah. Well Lwig I you could tell how broken I am in general because Lwig didn't respond to us about like the time he was he was okay about it but then he like streamed a bunch and then you tagged me and Lwig cuz we didn't reply. like when are we doing the podcast? And I replied like I don't like jumbled English. I don't care whatever. I looked I I opened it up cuz I went to the I went to the magic castle where you can't use your phone in LA which is like this I don't know this mansion of magicians magic. So I can't you can't check your phone. Pathetic [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] magic. But you have been to magic. No I haven't. Your phone's the most magic thing in the world. My phone is really Well, then what the guy does is he bring it up on stage and he goes, "Oh, he goes, "Is this your phone?" I thought you were raw guessing that the first act actually did do that. It was like a whole like integrated phone thing he did. Oh my god. He was That was the one I liked the least cuz it was like scan my QR code. Anyway, it I I I opened this up in the evening to see like just to make sure we're on for this morning and 5:53 p.m. which is like 45 minutes after your stream had ended and it's like a broken I don't care like all spaced out and spelled wrong and then just whatever Lwig wants. I I'm not kidding. After that session, I just went I just laid in my bed, not even my floor cuz that's a sacred place. I just laid in my bed and just stared at the ceiling. So sad he laid in his bed. Sounds like this is like what I feel like when I lose money in Vegas. Dude, it affects my real mood and my real life. Yeah, I genuinely cuz this does happen to a degree with like especially when I was pushing for Immortal in Valerant, but with this is why I stopped playing Melee at the end of last year, which was Yeah. I I realized that when I started doing the Lwig, the new Lwig job and I was like I'd work and especially during that time last year, I was really stressed and then I'm playing Melee and I'm trying the hardest I've ever tried. I play every day. I get coaching. I'm going to tournaments. I'm very emotionally invested and I realize that oh I'm stressed all day doing like my job and then I go do my like fun hobby which is like maybe even more stressful for me emotionally you would say harder than your job is harder than your job maybe it psychologically psychologically for and and I would like so I'd spend all week like practicing against Marth right I'd practice shake Marth all the time and I'd get like seeing all these like results and like things come together in practice and then they'd be like weeks straight I'm VOD reviewing, I'm doing all this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and then I go to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Verdugo and then I lose to Y hat like last stock game game five I'm losing to Y hat and Danny Denny SF and and then I'd go home to my girlfriend and I'd just walk in the room was silent like a ghost and I'd lay down in bed and she's like did you have fun and I just like yeah dude my girlfriend will message me she'll be like how is the rift today and all I just me I'm like I'm just a big [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lol cow aren't Aren't you? I'm your big [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lol cow boyfriend who sucks and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is and sucks and is a dumb bastard and she's like, "You're my lol cow." And I'm like, "That's so sweet, but I'm a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like it doesn't help. It doesn't help." I think that's the hard thing is I realized that that the problem is when she asked me if I had fun or like how did I do like there's no we had reached a point in our relationship where she realized that when I'm in that when I'm feeling that there's nothing she can say no there's zero things that can be said actually nothing is the only thing that could be said nothing nothing hits pretty good nothing hits amazing I dead ass think I dead ass think one day with me I can fix you cannot play a lane bro you are a child you. It's not about that. It's not about that. I am like the Sona guy. I can train master players. I'm not master. I can just do it. I know. I don't move like I used to, but I know. Whatever. Well, I'm eight games down as of talking about this on today. Who knows what'll happen today. Maybe I concede. Maybe Nick flies. Eight games down. Like eight games behind you. Yes, I'm eight games down. Wait, it's got to be more than that. Damn. No, it's not. It's eight. Is that four per? Where you at? What are you at right now? What's the check? I'm 10 games down. Podcast update. Where are you at? I'm at silver 248. Silver 248. That's 10 games. I'm in silver 4. Dude, I can fix you. I don't think it's There's no time to fix me. Yes, there is. So much genuinely to to end this. What do you What has to happen right now for you to go to bronze? Do you have to lose one game? I I hit my uh my threshold because you know how it doesn't let you go to bronze. You only get one buffer game. Well, sometimes you get two extra. You used to get two. I don't think it's a random amount. It doesn't tell you. Anyway, maybe I'll just send it Diana mid. Who knows? I mean it the the thing is so volatile. Like if I go one and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] six and he goes six and one, it's a swing. We're we're back. Like he I think he's actually above me in that world. Guys, we'll see what happens.
