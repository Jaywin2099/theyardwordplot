Super go around and rank everyone's fits like one through five. One through five. You can please where where one is the best and five is the worst. One, that was Aiden for audio listen. Oh, my bad. Aid in one two go. Nick's two. Nick two. Slime. Jesus Christ. I'm saying then Lewig. Then Lewig. Oh my god. This You know what? I get why super fans become the way they do. What does that mean? Uh not Zipper. Elaborate. We have uh we have Zipper's alternate identity here today. Yeah. button. It's Rich out. We've called out Rich. Rich, I sent something in the group chat. Can you pull it up for us to watch? This is a uh a fan. Oh my god. Look how fast. Look how fast Rich did it. It's because Super has to do a drag before every pull-up. Relax, dude. I don't even want to watch myself playing basketball again. This is This is a fan cam. This is from an account called uh like Super TF Clips. Super TF Daily. Yeah. Well, I see it. Super TF monkey. I did say your eyesight was going. So your legs and your arms look like they come from two different people. Now before he watches, Aiden, do you know much about Super and Supers fans and viewer base? So what I know about Super is that you met Jimmy Fallon. That is true. And then it's just twice actually. Twice. Well, you only meet someone once. Well, I was on him twice. So that's a good distinction. I didn't know that. I think I knew you met him once and then I know nothing after that. I'm s this episode. I know very little about what you do. You're going to love his little history. You're going to have a lot of questions. Is the TF Team Fortress? Yeah, actually that's where it came from. That's I thought it was the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] So, is there is there context that I need before I watch this? Uh, no. No. I've never seen this. Oh, yeah. So, Aiden, this is called basketball. Okay. It sounds like something I wouldn't be very good at. And that is a police chief who was hosting the event. Yeah, you look [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy. I got those glasses from this guy named Keith. He flies planes. He's retired. I don't think we should Maybe we should cut all the jokes at the beginning now that I think about it. We're on those super clip. This is the average Super fan. Let me see this. Super. I need you. All right. So, this is a clip. Uh, it was supposed to be Super's highlights from Schumer games. And for audio listeners, it's just him throwing up the worst basketball shots you've ever seen. Dude, you actually jumped when you did this. Hold on. Hold on. Wait, every single shot missed the rim. Dude, this is awesome. That was five shots of hitting missing to volleyball and it hit your own head. This isn't a basketball game. This was a game of horse. Yes. So, like that's good context there. You Oh, yeah. Wait, really? I've done cosplays. You don't know that? Oh, you going the sneaky route? Well, not like entirely. I dabble from time to time. Fair enough. We all dabble. Look up super TF2B. Oh, that's a sneaker route. Like, I'm not a bottom. Are you kidding me? I've done a few. Super TF Aiden. Super TF was a competitive Overwatch player. He played in the Overwatch League. See, that's the only thing I know because that's the context of the Fallon interview. What? How does Fallon How does Fallon smell? How does he smell? Honestly, I didn't speak to him at all before or after the recording. We went in, spoke for 6 minutes, and we were out. So, not even like Cuz you're sitting next to Not even like a beforehand. Hey, nice to meet you. I'm Jimmy. Whatever. No, we were in and we were out. That's it. The second time, too? Well, second time was co so it was all online. Yeah, it was online. So, you didn't make up anything. You didn't What arranged that? How did that happen? I don't know. We So, like we won and then we flew back to LA like a few days later and then we got a message from someone at Blizzard. Oh, yeah. That'sorgeous. Wait, what? Why do you got nipples? You have nipples. Well, it was it was a whole breastplate I bought for it. So, it went on under has a way bigger breast plate. I've never even ordered like triple G's or whatever. What I'm saying is that's not that's bad too. Why are you hot? A plate of breast. What can I say? This is crazy. Is there a bunch of this one? There is the last the last one. Keep it going. Keep it going. Come on. Oh my god. This is super smooth ass. Thank you. I had a Do you think Jimmy Fallon's seen this pick? No, I don't think so. Well, he follows me on Twitter, so Oh, it's possible. Jimmy Fallon's intern has seen this pick. Did Jimmy Fallon just smell like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rum? I don't know. I mean, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I felt like I couldn't get like close enough to even get a whiff. Like, it's like we walked out, then we had to walk around the desk like a protective aura. Yeah, cuz he's like a scumbag that no one respects. It's like What are you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] doing? Trying to get him not invited for a third time. I don't know about that. I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hate Jimmy Fallon. We're still in the clip. You can defend him. Yeah. I mean, he was I mean, he was nice, I guess. I don't really get I didn't get a chance to really like, you know, speak to them cuz it was all scripted. Something I've always That's what I was going to ask. Something I always wonder about that show is do you know every question you're going to be asked. They gave us like a whole like rough outline of what they're going to ask and what we're going to say and then we walk out and the sign flashes please applause and then please laugh. It's all it's all scripted. We all need that for the yard. I was thinking about it for the commenters and the viewers. Like we should have a we Archie should put a laugh now graphic on the screen for viewers at home. For viewers at home to know when to laugh. What if we did like you know that Scrubs episode where they make it into a sitcom setup that for one episode they use like all the cameras and the frame rate and all that. It's very interesting and they have a laugh track. We could just do like a a laugh track episode of the yard. Um, but Jimmy Fallon, I genuinely I've watched that interview with with you and Sinatra, which is really funny. Yeah. And I think he's just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hammered. He's like, "So, you just play video games? That's a pretty good impression video and you're making money out of it." You know, it's so amazing. Yeah, it's crazy. He's like clearly [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hammered. He's just inebriated every day. Every every day he walks in the office. Yeah, that's why his face is all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. Anyway, enough about Jimmy do not need to chill on Jimmy. Oh, really? Okay. You know what? Jimmy's white knight right here. And I emphasis on that first. I just think you're blind shooting that he's drunk every day. If he Where's the There were There were There were uh this is an account of this. All the people that worked around him and said this that he's always shitfaced and really mean. But see, I could say it a different way and we would all interpret it. Like I could be like, you know, Jimmy Fallon's drunk on every show and everyone's like, "That's pretty cool." I mean, that's the duality of me, actually. Yeah, dude. He's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up the whole time. And he clutches it every time. Just raw. Honestly, that kind of makes him the goat. That's what I'm saying. He can clock in, be hammered, clock out. That's like Aiden. Yeah. Aiden is hammered every time he does his show. Yeah, it's true. Especially Yeah. I mean, it's noon, so it's going to be a long day. So, Super TF, you're 25. I am. Oh, you're 25. You were an Overwatch pro and now you were a full-time streamer and you stream probably like 16 hours a day. Wait, pause real quick. Why did you say damn it? You're so young. Well, how old are you? 29. Isn't that funny with that haircut, too? And me and Aiden are both Wait, you're 20. You're 28 still. I'm 20. I'm 30. Okay. Well, I'm playing on this show. I'm 28. I'm 30. Aiden's the youngest and he's 28, which means you're the youngest by a lot. Oh my god. Super. yesterday. He was like, he messaged me. He was like, he said, "Slime, oh, about the afterparty." He said, "Slime, you have to go to the afterparty or I'm going to kill myself." And I'm like, "I'm halfway home, man. I don't go to parties. I'm 35." Okay, that's so funny to me, too, because when we were at EVO and we were doing the meet and greet, this guy's dropping like, "Oh, this guy's chopped h. This guy's 35 saying [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like chopped huzz, but he can't go to parties." I think there's a difference. Why are you pretending? I don't want to, but I, you know, I think the language is fun to use. Oh, it's fun to use. Fun to use. Oh, it's fun to use. Interesting. You know what else is fun? Well, that's interesting. Well, it's interesting and it's fun to use and then to tweet out about me. When I'm in a 100 foot radius of Jason, when you get into a 10ft radius of Jason the you immediately your eyes kind of like glaze over and you start going, "Chat, nah, chat. Nah." And it's like, bro, at least I'm saying chopped hus with like like, you know, I'm wearing a briefcase while I'm doing it, right? You're trying to pretend. Okay. So, why would I do a Jamaican accent? Do you clap like a monkey? You celebrate. Let me clarify. But when I throw on my young white boy accent, I get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lambasted. Your white boy accent. Yeah, it's my young white boy accent around Jason. Yeah, this is like if I was like Lacy's age. Let me clarify by the way the when he said chop huzz the guys that he was talking to they were like 20 years old so there was no briefcase sort of suit when I present it to them I say chopped huz right fellas like that's that's the that's the guy in the room with you saying he didn't do that that's the justosition I'm just saying the guy in the room with you is saying that didn't happen like that by the way at at streamer games too like they were like they were young right they were like 20 or something they were 22 21 and Nick did like a 2hour our like line of just doing meet and greet stuff. Yeah, we're famous pretty much. We're totally famous. But these and I was like, "Okay, guys, on three two hollows or Jane Remover and they looked at me like, "What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you talking about?" Yeah, they hadn't heard of either of those people. I thought that was really awesome that that happened. All right. I was like, "Oh, you guys just like video games. Cool. Only video games." Also, I just realized that Super is the age I was when we started this show. So, if you go look at episode one and you hold us side by side, we would be the same age. Archie, you get to do that. You'd probably look a little older though. Then why? What? Well, I just What do you mean I look older than you back then? Well, he's got a boyish look of I also have a boyish look. Well, I've been told this forever. 29year-old guy. I have a boyish look. Oh, I lo I lost my boyish look. Yeah, that's what happens. You lose your boyish look. I haven't lost your boyish look. And also and also I wouldn't have lost it back then, which is when he's saying I wouldn't have it. I don't think back then you had it. Oh my god. Well, you never had it. Are we being hurtful today? So, Love is a culture vulture and I'm old. Yep. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. That I can actually call back this one. Uh yeah, but you do you do have of every streamer I know, maybe outside of E-ROB, one of the most vicious fan bases. And I found this out when I invited you to enter an UAM tournament. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Cuz you were playing it I saw on stream, but you're playing it at like midnight. I was doing a tournament the next day at like 10:00 a.m. Yeah. And I invited you on in your chat, which is kind of bming me. Yeah, it was a little I put you on blast and your chat [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] revolted, bro. You part-time [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] streamer lazy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] put me on the fire, brother. It was like 45 minutes of his chat calling him like a lazy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for not wanting to wake. You are such a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] loser. This is why nobody ever wants to hang out with you. Nobody ever invites you. Twink, dude, it's like 1:00 a.m. I'm tired. I got, you know, like I don't know this game. He's he asked me like in eight hours to wake up. I'm like, I can't I can't do this right now. But I did promise to go to the next event, which was streamer games. But what's funny is the only reason you promised is cuz your chat made fun of you for 45 minutes. Well, if your chat had just been like, "It's all right, man. Go to bed." Then you wouldn't have messaged me, dude. I'm sorry. I can't make it. You would just been like, "Hey, you asked me 10 hours in advance. I can't make it." Obviously, look, it's all in good fun. Do you ever get off stream like every once in a while and you're just like like that one was hard? Okay, you know what's funny? I a lot of the comments are like so intentionally obviously rage bait and I messaged Slime about this one time. I was like, "Dude, I see you go off on Twitter about these stupid [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sometimes." And I just I I get it because like I don't care if it's rage bait or if it's obvious or if you want a reaction. Sometimes people just say dumb [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and you got to say shut the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up because people are dumb. Okay, let's not pretend Slime goes on Twitter to say shut the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. Slime goes on Twitter to do a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 13 back and forth dissertation. You know what the best part is? When I see him like reply to somebody and it's been like 18 hours they don't reply. He replies to himself like any stupid [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm working. Why haven't you replied yet? I think it's a good question. I'm kidding. That's one of my favorites. Why are we not continuing to talk? You know what's so hard is following the threads sometimes cuz they'll start double tweeting and then it'll go off on a different thread. Yeah. Different trees. There's almost a skill to reading all of slime's tweets. It's like a night of the Old Republic like dialogue tree where you have to choose the the good the Sith and the Jedi. But most of the time it's treasure. There's treasure to be found in. No, I agree. I agree. But you're not like this. No, you don't you don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] go to bat. You're you're just you're you're you're a true tank. Yeah. I mean Yeah. I I have the problem where I just imagine someone is saying it in front of me, which is obviously not what's happening, but I'm like, why would you say that in front of me? And then I have what I think is a more normal re reaction, but you just sit there. I was at um we were at World's Greatest and it was end of the day and we me and you were playing Tekken. We ran a first of five, by the way. Destroyed him. I won by I just want to point that out. I I did I won the first to five. Yes. In Tekken. How could they possibly agree what happened? Remember this. So different. I guess we'll never know. What's crazy is you not only one you did the this which implies like a 5. That's like a ass spanking. That's what happened. Which is completely not true. By the way, I remember that I was on Raina, he was on Nina, and then he started getting his ass whooped and then he went Kuma took one game and then I won. That's embarrassing. Are you sure? I promise you. This is so wild to be honest. I promise you. No, my goats washed cuz at EVO you washed me. I could not keep up cuz you've been playing Tekken. But um but I was like and we were playing and then after a game I turned him like does it like when they're mean to you does it make you mad? Does it get to you? And he looks at me he's like nu he's like two shots deep or something. He's like no way man. No way. Is there is there a single message that suck out they still message think about it every once in a while. Yeah. Like maybe they saw you play basketball and then they like really like it's like more funny than anything cuz sometimes I'll think about it. I remember there was one time I was like I forget if it was like Valent or something. I was playing with a bunch of people and there was someone in my chat that was like it's incredible how all your friends are good-looking and then you look like dot dot dot that first I don't think I'm ugly by any means actually. Well, you don't think you're dot dot dot? No, I don't I don't think I'm dot dot dot. Absolutely not. Like melted ice cream or something. That's perfect. That's such a good hate comment. It's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. That's so good. But, you know, you kind of just roll with it cuz it's I mean, you know, it's Twitch chat. It is. It is Twitch chat. I think I think you kind of get it. You roll with it a lot. Yeah. But I mine is like like diet like light version. I think mine is much more like a diet version. Mine is much more in like the queso realm. I mean, like maybe what less like Queso's viewers make fun of him, but they're also very loving and supporting. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And I think my viewers are also very loving and supporting. They [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] love me. And they also call you fat. Yeah. Yeah, they'll call me fat, but then they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] give me all their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] money. I guess I mean that's the trade-off, right? That's the idea of Twitch is like I get to be mean to the guy who's famous. In return, you get trade offer type thing. I mean, I think that's a pretty good [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I got some vicious soldiers. But then I got a Mean. You got what? A Me like a nice viewer. Oh, it's one of your viewers. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Super don't have a nice view. You know who it is? It's me. I will go I watch Super a lot. I'll just cuz you're always live. So, I'll be in his chat and I'll literally say to the chat, I don't have a check mark next to my name. I just stay among the He thinks he's cool. He thinks he's cool. But also, it gives you it gives you attention sometimes that you don't want like I don't want people to know I have a check mark so I can kind of like blend in like like in Assassin's Creed when you hold A and you're just like touching people's shoulders going through blending through the crowd. So, but I will I will literally be like, "Hey guys, we should be nicer." I feel like like it like it's chatter just trying to suggest it and then people will reply to me and go oh omega lol no it's so funny cuz I do the exact opposite I go in and I'm like last pick incoming like before the streamer games draft and then everyone would be like lol true that's dude you know this guy called me a code switcher cuz I remember I went to your he called you a code switcher call it like a season not brother I sometimes I go to streams and I'm like, "Dude, you're looking good today. You're looking you're funny. Keep up the great work." And then I said that in live stream one time and he's like, "This motherfucker's code switching." I'm like, "What do you even mean?" And he's like, "Oh, off stream or in DMs, this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] flames me. Not true, by the way." And but then in stream, he compliments me. And do you not want to be complimented ever? Is that what it is? Can I not spread misinformation? Is that not like human [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right? Can I not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lie on your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mans? What's the point of developing a platform if you can't spread misinformation from it? I mean, this guy has a whole podcast dedicated to it. Yeah. And that's dangerous cuz that has to do with wealth and economics and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and AI. Lower taxes and vaccines don't work. It was very interesting. There was a guy at the event yesterday. How are you guys not deplatformed? Don't ask questions. That's a good question. There was a guy at the event yesterday who was like, "Yeah, I used to listen to the Yari podcast." And I was like, "Okay." you know, weird opener, but yeah. What made you stop? He's like, I just listened to the lemonade stand now and such brought a dog to the event. Oh, that and I thought that that was nice guy. Ironic. Was it that big considering Aiden thinks that all dogs should be put down government man? Oh, it was a cute dog. Yeah. So, he What was the dog's name? Did you ask? Snow. Snow. He knew it. What's the cat's name? There was a cat there, too. Oh, there was a cat there. The girl had a cat on a leash. Yeah, I saw I did not see that. My name was Churro. Hi, Churo. Churro was a very sweet cat. Aiden once came on this podcast and he there was a dog in a coffee shop and he went on about 42 minute tirade. I timed it that he wanted to basically put a shotgun in every dog's mouth like a cop and pull the trigger. Dogs shouldn't be in public. They're a nuisance. They're a pest. They're no different than a pigeon or a rat. I said all of that. I actually said those two short sentences for 22 minutes straight. Okay, good. Again, I ask how are you guys not deplatform? What are you talking about? How is that? How are you not deep platform? You're a Discord hoodie. that's sewn onto your skin. Clearly not, brother. It's actually over. They were saying cuz Supra's outfit on stream is a t-shirt and then a Discord branded hoodie. It's literally this, but with sometimes with a Discord hoodie sometimes, man. I'm not. Okay. But in the summer, I'm not wearing it. It's too hot. But he people were saying like he didn't like the Discord hoodie. It was like his homunculus that was healing him. But the sun he didn't have it for streamer day. Some people say it's like welded to my skin. I have like a curse of binding. I can't take it off. How do you feel about how do you feel about a 35year-old man wanting to be your friend so bad? I I have no problem with it. Slime's a cool guy. He wants to be my friend. He was begging me to come to the party. He DM me. I did want him to go to the party and he basically said, "I would rather you kill yourself than me go to the party." No, he genuinely would. I think I'm not even being like sarcastic here. I think if you said with a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] video of you on the roof of a building, I'm going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] jump off if you don't come to this party. He'd be like, dude, [Laughter] he tried to let me down. He tried to let me down light, though. He was like, "A goat, I can't go to parties. I'm 35." I'm like, "Dude, get over yourself. Like, just come just come for a little bit. Like, we dude, we need you around more." I was I was only there for a little bit and then I left, but at least I showed up. Slime wants to express his friendship by being in your chat and that's it. That's not true. By the way, arms distance, I think. No, I feel I feel a bit impostery because there's a 10-year age gap between us. So, it's problematic, right? It is. Wait, wait, hold up. For our relationship, you're good. Wait, half my age plus seven? Half your age plus seven would be 24 and a half. Oh, thank God. Well, we can start a relationship. But either way, um, this is the first year. Congrats. There there is this idea where it's like I'm 35year-old like older guy and like young super TF I don't want to be the guy who's like trying to hang out and being vibed out right so I will just I like being alone too so I play a very safe range where if I'm wanted then that's great but if I'm not I don't try evaluating evaluating whether or not to go to the party like pre flop ranges like pre flop pre flop ranges well that was more I just hate parties uh but yeah at EVO it was really fun cuz I'm like, you know, I get we're hanging out and we're like at EVO, did you guys do the meet and greet together? Like you two as a duo? No, it was like uh a bunch of people that were in the the Sage Jam slam. We were all kind of lined up and we were next to each other. I see. Yeah, but he dude super It's funny cuz I I feel kind of like his dad because Sat Saturday night he messages me. He's like, "Brother, is there any shot you have a long sleeve shirt?" He asked me and I'm like, "Uh, sure. I can bring one." And he shows me how [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sunburnt he is. He stole the aloe. They were Okay. The production staff at Mogul Moves is calling him aloe boy. Oh god. Because you took you took the only bottle of aloe vera that they had. Okay. In my defense, how are you not bringing more aloe? Like one bottle. I think it's just the fact that you took the whole thing. How How much aloe does a person go through? I mean, it says like use liberally when you like look at the bottle. Liberally, brother, you were doing that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it. There's no way you had sunscreen on. I just don't believe I Oh, yeah. You can see it on my ankles, too. It's like on the back of my leg, my neck, my face. It's And you know what's funny about that, too? It's like I feel like my my vibe for the whole event was like that of a wounded dog that needs to be put down. Back to you, Aiden. Um, everyone like I would I would walk up to people and they would just look at me. They would go, "Oh, like I was I was pied almost cuz they would look at me. They're like, "Oh my god, are you okay?" I'm like, "No, not really, but I'm here, I guess." I mean, there was 40 competitors. You got 33rd overall. Okay, that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up, by the way. I would been probably like a recount on that. It's just points. Okay, but I got first in egg drop. That's got to be worth something. It was worth about 40 to 33rd. Yeah. And then basketball was our throwaway game, I think, but I didn't even get last. I got like sixth. I don't know what we got in the other events, but there's no way 33rd. The answer is sixth. You got six in the other events and then and then seventh. Sixth in everything should equal to 30th place because if you do the math that's three4s. Yugi showed up for one day and he did better than you. Okay. But he was Did you also get seventh in other events? Did he love it? Oh yeah. Then that would probably put you lower than 30. So how many out of how many it was again? Out of 40. I got into some drama actually because of super too. Really? Yeah. Well, there's a lot of people who got mad at me after the uh the list came out because Well, yeah. Well, you people have been asking for the list. No, not the Well, it's supposed to. They hyped it up and they said they were going to release it and you're not I come out with it and I just It doesn't seem like something you should withhold. And it's But it's like get over it. Get over it. It's the stakes feel high. I was on the young side. the young. No, they were mad because after the event, I think the event was quite successful. A lot of people were mad they didn't get invited. So, there was a lot of people went on stream and also some streamers who DM'd me. Dude, I I won't say who, but I got DM'd. They were like, "Tell me to invite me to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] It's pathetic that he doesn't." And I'm like, "What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you say [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me for?" I didn't do anything. You don't even work. I don't even do [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for him at all. I just make his life harder. Uh, but I I had like like five DMs from creators like that and then Oh, this is super handy. Oh, bro, it is so loud. At 10 a.m. He's like, "What are the odds you have a long sleeve for me to use today?" I said, "I can bring one." That's the bottle of aloe in his hotel room. You took it home. I needed to look. Did you finish it off? You stole aloe from our bottle. Did you finish it off on some diddy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] No. Dude, dude, it's it's rain. Just a guy who's really sunburned has pallets of aloe. This super TF raid and a thousand bottles of aloe discovered. Like, no, there's like he's not like doing anything weird. He's just really pale. I don't know. But you still send him in jail. But yeah, I had a bunch I had a bunch of people reach out to me and then a bunch of people on stream who were like mad that I didn't invite them. There was a clip from Neon. Oh, really? I'm I've met the guy for 30 seconds. Sure. And it was like, why wasn't I invited to streamer games? And some people, you know, again, I'm not going to say who. They were like, Super TF was invited. Okay, you got to tell me. I don't get it. You have to tell me after, you know, so I like this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] guy. You know, it's kind of funny. I feel like that soldier me. It's kind of funny though. The guy on the bed cuz like not everyone's going to get invited to every event cuz when I don't get invited to events, back to my chat, they're always like, "Fucking loser, why weren't you invited?" And I'm like, "Dude, I don't need to go to every single thing that's happening. It's not It's not the end of the world. I'll go for some stuff. I won't go for other stuff. It's not It's not going to hurt me. It's not going to kill me. I know FOMO guy. I like this. I like this." Yeah. I mean, I like to go to the events that I'm invited to. And if I'm not, so be it. When Kai didn't invite me to streamer university, I didn't even feel like that bad about it, man. I had the grades, too. I think it was just my last name. What class would you have taught at Stream University? Streamer University. They were teaching stuff there. Homogyny in Sweden. Yeah. Why all the streamers should move to Sweden? Euthanism of pets. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Dude, I got It's funny. Well, let me uh read out a DM I got after this was I I charted the time and it was right when I rated Ron's um gymnastics routine. FaZe stable Ronaldo. He said, "Keep yourself safe, you bald. Wait, is it random? Yeah, dude. I thought it was so broad. That would be crazy. And then this person. So that was cuz that was a very contentious part cuz it had to do with me, Nut, and um what's her name? I'm sorry. Elena, who was a actual gymnast and he messaged me 5 hours later. I didn't respond. Messaged me 5 hours later. You really got me tight over a streamer games event. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you. And I was weird beautiful mixture of self-aware and completely unselfware. And I was like, "Bro, you got to get some friends. It is Saturday night. This is not it." You responded. Yeah, I always respond. What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do you mean, did you respond, bro? We first responded, bro. You notice how none of us asked. If he said he didn't respond, I would be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] shocked. Wait, I said, "Bro, you got to use some present. It is Saturday night. This is not it." And haven't messaged me back. So, I think maybe he took my advice. He didn't respond. Why haven't you responded back? No, no, no, no. I that that was a fine I you got you don't understand the nuance. Oh, that's what he told me, too. He was like, you don't I was cuz I asked him at EVO. I was like, how many people do you have blocked on Twitter? He's like, eh, like 2500. And I'm like, what's why? And he's like, no, you don't understand. These are artistal blocks. 100%. As if like he has like a fine art to who he blocks. If anything, I'm like, what are you talking about? Arms to table. No, no. It's the McDonald's of blocking. If you were if you were if it was artisal, you would be more selective. You would Excuse me. I am selective. I'm usually I That was embarrassing. That was embarrassing to listen to. People who have pretty like valid criticism, I tend not to block them because I appreciate that. But if they're just like shooting like grenades into my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'll block them, right? And I I make a judgment of that. What are you doing? Slime is right. What? You've been right all this time. For what? What? For years I was antilock. Imagine that. For years I thought blocking was dumb. You know, it leads to someone being like got them to block me and it's like, you know, just ignore it. Sure. And then I realized recently blocking's good. What? And I've blocked artisally. Really? A few people. Blocking's bad, dude. That's that's an artisal blocker. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] his bad because he took he took many years thinking about it. Yeah. Pizza is good, but maybe should I make my own bad when you sent your first one dropping the hammer on. You know why blocking is good, Aiden? Why? Cuz it it blocks them from just replying to the posts and there is an influx I've noticed more than ever. This is maybe for me. I don't know if you guys have it of just bots or like just automatic replies sent under every blocking bots isn't artisal though. This isn't just a reply. This is my game. weeds. Sure. Yeah, that's that's putting up a fly. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] weed. I think I think the go-to for for stuff in general is muting. Muting is beautiful. Because muting is basically the other person doesn't know you've done it and you live and you live in a fantasy land forever. I agree. I agree with that. I didn't mute fiction. I think I never would mute fiction. I think artisal blocking is weeding and I think part of that is the bots, but I also think part of it is maybe just people who are acting like bots. Yeah, they only want one thing and it's to make you feel bad and that's okay. So, it's like whatever. But I think muting is actually cowardly. Cowardly. Pussyike. That's what I'm saying. What is it? Blocking or muting? Muting for sure. You are a pathetic where you were. I'm with you. I'm muting. I don't I don't block anybody with him and you're still young in your journey, you're going to get to where we're at. Oh, so once I age to a certain point, it's like the tree of wisdom. The the 30 year olds understand the value of blocking these 20 year olds. They don't get it. They're young. Wait, I'm 30. You're not, Aiden. Why do you want to be older than you are? Why is this bit? What does he want to get of the game? He wants to get ahead of the game. He's trying to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] steal Valor. You don't get to steal our stealing valor. You don't get it, bro. And I go to Denny's and I got a special in 95. I like I like muting for the same reason I like the way YouTube handles like ghost blocking. Shadow banning is so important on YouTube. So like I feel like on on Twitter if I block someone especially cuz I I would say 90% of people I have muted are people I know in real life and if I mute if I block someone it's like oh I don't want to see their words. So if I block them they're going to eventually see that and then give me more words and I don't want those words. producing words. I think it's so if I just mute them, they never know and I don't see them. I don't see the words ever again. In the mathematical problem though, they're still giving you the words. You're just closing your eyes to it. But if you block them, the words can never come again. No, but the words come outside of the platform because they go, "Why did you block me?" I'm saying I'm getting rid of all their words because I don't see them anymore. You just block them again. This is a That's insane. No, they're just like a final. This is a more individual one or like personal one I guess cuz I you know the people personally but even I even for random people like there's people who make multiple accounts and follow us. I don't block the accounts cuz they'll make more if I if I just never acknowledge them. It just stops. Yeah. I don't know. Everyone everyone has their own flavor of why. But why is it so impactful on YouTube in your opinion? Well, in YouTube it's shadow banning which makes them unless they check and refresh they're they can't see their comment. So they can't do anything about it besides make a new YouTube account which no one is going to do. Like so a lot of people don't even know they get shadowbanned. They say something really awful and then they just get to live in their little insane cage that no one gets to see. Cuz if you mute somebody, they reply to your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and other people can see that and be like, "Yeah, yeah, they're right. He does look like a lesbian or whatever." Right. But like I think it's easier to make a YouTube channel than a Twitter Twitter account. Uh is it is that true? But no one wants to do that because Twitter has that 20step capture now because you can't be famous in YouTube comments. You can be famous on Twitter. Good way. So it's like there's there's no incentive there to do that if you're shadowbanned. Plus you lo you lose your awesome homepage and you lose your awesome your algorithm. You lose your algorith. Do you get awesome big titted women in your YouTube comments? I actually Yeah, I do. They they like post like a minute after or they comment like a minute after I go live like what do they even say that like oh this is not a performance. This is whatever. I'm like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you talking about? Like this is such an inspirational I'm like what even is this? Why do these even exist? Like what's the point? I don't know what the strat is. I don't know what the value is. I don't know why YouTube hasn't gotten rid of them. I don't know. I don't know the answer to all your questions. Dub, who was the Do you remember the first slide that you ever got? The first slide? Oh no. He doesn't know what it means. What do you mean? You talking about like a DM slide? Like someone sliding in your DMs? [Music] I have no idea. No. No, I really don't. It wasn't during Overwatch. I mean, it was probably was I I don't remember like the specific individual. Did you have ladies throwing themselves out your out there at your league? At your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] twink buddy. Tell me about the Overwatch League. Uh I mean or any boys? Not really. a little bit maybe. But I was playing Overwatch, man. You know what's funny? Actually, when Overwatch came out, this was in like my junior year of high school, Overwatch one came out and a girl wanted to go to prom with me and I said no cuz I wanted to play Overwatch. Whoa. So, you didn't go to prom? That's grind set, bro. I I respect that. That's junior year. What was your year? Well, senior year I did it all online because I had to fly out to California for Overwatch League. You did prom online? No. That's tight. That would be I just do the dance floor. Oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Hopping hopping in the Google Meet. So everyone makes fun of me. They say, "Oh, you don't have like high school dropout." No, I did graduate high school. I have my diploma, but then they make fun of me. They call it a PDF diploma. So like you can't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] win. What's your GPA in high school? Like 3.8, 3.9, something like that. I like you how you have like a LeBron bubble ring, but it's for high school. Well, I was on it before I was on online high school before it got cool cuz that was like 2018 and then CO shut everything down. So, I was on the way. Just to be clear, it's never been cool. As much of a loser as the people your high school grad year is what? 2018. Christ. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I was 2008. That was my college grad. I was eight. Whoa. It's just 10 years difference. It doesn't change. I don't know. When he was four, you were 14. What? Yeah. That's crazy. Yeah. And it keeps going like that. Are you an only child? No, I have a brother. Oh, okay. Old or younger? Older. Oh, do you just mo his ass cuz you're Cuz you're an awesome gamer. No, I don't mog his ass. Does he mo you because he's strong? Uh, well, no. There's no mogging. Really? Is he taller? Does he work? There's a little bit of mogging. There's not a taller. Show us a picture of him. Show us your brother. I don't know if I have a picture. He's shorter. Wait, you're younger and you got banned and and you're taller, brother? You're logging him. What are you trying to do, man? Inate. We're trying to tear your family apart. Well, how about this? What's your relationship like with your brother? I mean, well, I I tell me why it's bad. Because of the difference in height and money, and I want to see a picture of your mother after all of you. Your mom is I got you on really nice. My mom. Yeah, she's pretty nice. That's cool. Pretty nice. She's very like um she's still kind of cuz like I guess I'm the youngest and she might have a little bit of like uh I'm not being mean. What's the word? Like emptiness syndrome. No, she's just like very attached. So whenever I go over there cuz I like live in Philly and my family, she's like, "Oh, hi sweetie." Like, you know, she's still very like affectionate and stuff. She's mama bear. Yeah. She's mama bear. Yeah. But she doesn't do that to your older brother who is some sort of discarded h. A black a black sheep of sorts. That's the case. Brother is your is he homeless? No. No. Older brother. He's not homeless. Your big brother is unhoused. TF left his brother behind once he became famous. Not at all. Literally not at all. That's not the case. Then what does he do for a living? He is working in HVAC. Okay. Okay. That's hype. So he's making bread. That's actually sick. I like that. A trade tradesman. Meanwhile, you're gaming all day on the internet pulling my fat ass. You're fat ass pulling your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] poppers doing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] poppers. Poppers. Not at all. Wait. Is are a lot of Twitch streamers doing poppers? It's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] problem. I tried them for the first time recently. Oh yeah. In what circumstance? Hm. What circumstance? I was in a hot tub with some friends and you wanted to what? Let your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Well, someone brought some poppers and I was like, you know, I never tried them. The hot tub's the last place I'd want my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to loosen up. The hot tub is the last place [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I feel like the their rep has been damaged. It's not as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] focused as you think it is. But don't you eat them with your butt mouth? You don't. What? The south mouth. There's no eating. Pause. Pause. What do you think happens? I think you put a pop. You think you take a bopper and put it? What is a pop rocks? They're pop no. They're pop rocks you put in your ass. That's exactly right. A popper looks like the little It's like a little ball and attached to it as a little string and you throw it on the ground and it makes a snap. Yeah. And so the popper is you put that up your ass. Put it up your ass and it pops and it pops. It creates force that opens your ass up. Years. I've never done drugs. You ever done drugs? I've never done drugs. That look that seemed like an offer. Did you see the way he like jump? He's never done. No, I also never done He's excited because he's also So that's why you guys were playing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] melee at the at the after party and you were losing to his one-handed peach. Well, don't bring up the one-handed Peach, but super. We're talking about wave dashing. I didn't know wave dashing came from Tekken. Oh, yeah. Uh and he was like, "Look, I'll show you." And then now we were watching Tekken videos in the corner of the party. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wave dashing came from Tekken. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't know that. He doesn't know. Guys who started in Tekken 8? Yeah, bro. You don't know. What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Is that not a melee tech? No, it's it's from Tekken. Well, it's it's a different Tekk in that game, but it looks similar. It looks visually misfamed. That's why it's That's why it's called that. Oh, so they had the exact term in Tekken. They invented the Tekken Tekken. Does it look like it? Yeah, it looks visually looks like it. Yeah. Is it in Tekken 8? It's in Tekken 8. Yeah. Why are you doing it? Not Not every character does it. Oh. Oh, I I No, sorry. I do back dashes, but yeah, I don't play a character who can do it. Oh, yeah. Also, Kuma can't move. Yeah. So, Nick was a terrorist at the club. Well, you said you had a question. Oh, I did have a question. I I was going to ask how did you first like hear me, see me, whatever, because I'm pretty sure with me and you, it was like in Among Us lobby way back in like 2020 or something with like during co train wreck was in there. You cheated, dude. Me, you, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] train wrecks, Pokemon, bro. Something like that. And we were saying all sorts of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] back then, bro. There was no filters back then. It was so awesome, man. No filters. People were [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] shackled. you. I was gonna ask how you first saw or heard of me or whatever. Me or No, you the Say James Slime. The first one? Yeah, the Tekken one. Oh, really? That's why that's how I found out who you were. And you know what? He was real antisocial. He played this dog [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Raina. Couldn't make it happen. And then when like the like he didn't interact with us when it wasn't a show day, when he didn't interact with us outside of it. And when it was over, he never talked to us again. I don't know how entirely accurate all of that is. Sounds pretty accurate. Sounds like some of it definitely is. And I was like, Super seems cool. I really liked his presence, but he seems like he doesn't want to like, you know, be friends. Well, okay, here's the thing. I It's not that I don't want to be friends. I just I would say like 98 99% of the time I'm like in my own bubble. Like I start stream, I end stream, it's just me. That's it. But like you, for example, like you're talking to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] everybody every day basically. M. And so that's why I always like going out to like events and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] because it's fun to see people that I don't interact with. But sometimes I'm also like I don't know if these people know who I am or if they want to talk to me. Like I don't know if I should just go up like hey like I'm super. They're like okay like so like I just get like this sort of like I don't know. I don't want to call it like imposttor syndrome sort of but like it's just like I cuz I do my own thing. Right. Right. Right. So do you get nervous when you see one of the phase guys and they go in for the dap and you're like I don't know if I'm ready. No, I'm I'm usually prepared for the dab. You think you got a good dad? I think I'm cutting your teeth. Esports. Overwatch League. Esports. Yeah, you you fumble more than ever. You find your way. Check this out. Rocket Monkey. Okay. And that would be some sort of app or No. No. Monkey the other way. Oh, I see. Like the way Donald Duck has it. How about How about How about this? Cocking Monkey. Okay. All right.

I like to see like what my uh unwanted subs are. It's lower than you'd think. It's really not a lot. I think it's $14,000. Uh like a little bit higher. Like a little bit. People People yell at me on the internet like millionaire streamer, stupid millionaire, millionaire. I'm like, dude, I'm not even close, dude. I've lost it all gambling, but also with my unwanted subscriptions. Yeah, my unwanted subscriptions. Also, the look, I will say this. The reason why I said Rocket Monkey is on my mind because, you know, Donald Duck has got it out and stuff is because I used the app to it gave me a dashboard of all of my Goon subscriptions and I found out it's been really bad. And you need to get rid of them. I and I got rid of all my goon stuff. Dude, you want to hear a funny one that I was subscribing to? What's that? Uh, cutie keeps losing the damn remote. Yeah. Our damn lives remotes. So, I downloaded an app and it makes you pay to use the app as a remote, dude. $40 a year. That's Oh, you did Rocket Money help you cancel that issue? I cancelled that. Rocket Money has over 5 million users and has saved people over $500 million in cancelled subscriptions. That's $740 a year using all the apps features.

Anyway, cancel your unwanted subscriptions and reach your financial goals faster with RocketMoney. Go to rocketmoney.com/theard. That's rocketmoney.com/theart. I'm sorry. I think slime can't read. I think you might be having a stroke. What do you smell? What do you smell, boy? Almonds like always. Oh, good. Okay, that's good. You know, we met a while ago, but I really thought I saw the true you after you started sending me like death threats. What? I do that, but I have good reason. What are you talking about? Why are you sending him death threats? I don't think I do. I owe you some money. Oh, yeah. So, he did send me death threats. He did owe me money. How much? Thou $2,500. Oh, you weren't paying up. Well, no. I was working on getting the money and and I was getting pressured cuz he became a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] debt collector cuz I'm getting I should have charged him interest. You owe me more money for this weekend, by the way. Do you see this guy for for like all the Ubers I had to take? Super. Are you doing okay? No, I'm I'm fine. I just I just think it's You're kind of Mr. Neita bad that he's you know he likes to dodge, but that's fine. He just he just comes he just comes through and he sends DMs. He has shooters. He has Tim [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sending me DMs. Tim. Yeah, Tim. Tim Tim is an avid Super TM viewer. Tim is an avid viewer of I think every streamer. I think me and Tim have the exact same on Twitch media diet. There's three people he watches. Okay. He he he when he watches me to work and then when he wants to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kick his feet up, he goes to watch Super and then Liam. That's right. Yeah, I've seen him exactly those. By the way, Liam Tim messaged me. He's like, "Liam's too nervous to ask for reimbursement uh for the hotel." And I was like, "Liam's got to be brave. I am not I'm not taking the first step." So, in the same way he did that with Liam, he did that with Super cuz Super and I were in a fantasy football league together and it was a $500 buyin league and it was like with a bunch of streamers and Super ended up doing very well. You got yourself first place and he was owed some money and it was my job because I was commissioner to pay him out. The issue is that although I asked several times, streamers are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lazy. They're lazy and several people didn't pay me out and so I was like waiting for people to pay me out to pay him out so I don't pay it out of my own pocket. It's supposed to be a pool of money. Yeah, cuz you're Did you get clobbered in this league? I didn't get clobbered. Yes, I did not get clobbered. He got like eighth out of 10th place. You at streamer. Okay, we don't have to bring this. What are we doing here? Did you get clobbered? not relevant to the conversation. What is I think the math it literally works out one to one the ratio is almost exactly the same. Yeah. So anyway, you know, I I got a bit busy. I wasn't so good at hounding the people, but Super was good at hounding me and I'm there it became after and to be fair it was a while. He was waiting a couple months and there was a point where Tim was sending me [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like daily messages like super needs his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mom. His brother's homeless, bro. He needs this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] He hates that job is not paying anymore. You got to find a way. His mom [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hates his brother. I know. I'm I'm canceling the league this year. Really? Yeah. So, we're not doing it? Yeah. I mean, someone else can carry the torch, right? I'll do it. Yeah. Okay. But here's the thing. He didn't tell me until after he paid me out that there were people that didn't owe money. So, it was like he paid me and then he like tried to make me feel bad for handling him cuz he was like, "Oh, by the way, I was late cuz I had to pay out of my own pocket." Hold up, hold up. I didn't want to burden you with that information beforehand. I did it after paying. I think that's good. So, then he like drops it on me. So, then I feel like an [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Yes. What would you rather have heard? Nothing. I mean, I'm I mean, I'm glad I got the money, but like, you know, Ludwig did this thing years and years ago before the stream, before everything, which I always thought was kind of swag. He did a a fantasy football league with like people you worked with, like your friends or something. And he he took all the money as the commissioner and used it to buy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] as like a loan without telling any of them. And then because he was like, "I'll get it back by the time the league is over so they won't know." Dude, I got like a thousand [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dollars. Crazy. I remember this. And I was like, he told me this and I was like, "Dude, what you would you spent that?" And he's like, "Yeah, I'm going to get it back." I'm like, "Okay." That's like what when David Chong, our college roommate, would spend all his FAFSA on [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like pasta. He would talk about the FAFSA hitting like it was the lottery. Yeah. He'd buy like candy and video games. And I'm like, "I don't know if you need it, dude. My I had a college roommate. His name was 68 cuz he was 6'8. Nice. And he got his FA. That's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. What if we called you 200, dude? That's a funny joke. That was fire. Sorry. Anyway, he his FAFSA hits and then I just see him on the couch just on the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] laptop and I'm like, "What are you doing?" He's like, "I'm looking at tickets." I'm like, "For what?" He's like, "A Gar Brooks concert, a country artist." Oh. I'm like, you know, I'm like, "Okay, cool." Like, "We're in Arizona." I'm like, "Oh, Phoenix." He's like, "No, East Coast." I'm like, "What?" He's like, "Yeah, I'm going to fly me and my girlfriend there." Like, "All right." He's like, "Yeah, I'm getting front row tickets." He ends up spending like $4,000 on just one concert or two concert tickets. Uh, and Burns are all FASA. Wow. For Gar [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Brooks. For G [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Brooks. That's crazy. Artists. Oh my god. That's awesome. It's awesome. Yeah. He would just sit in the room in in our uh in our shared apartment every day and just watch uh Trailer Park Boys. I thought I thought you were going to say Gar Brooks concert. He's got like an autistic hyperixation watching Gar Brooks. He would crush through Trailer Park Boys. I never saw him go to class and he went to Gar Brooks concerts. Where do you think he's at? What do you think he's doing? Uh I heard where he's at recently. I think he's in I think he's in Virginia. Work out there. I think Hback. So, you didn't go to college. You just got the whole thing. I did not. So, you haven't had sex yet. Okay. Well, that's not true. Wait, wait. Are your parents How are your parents about like the gaming stuff? The g Okay. So, that's actually funny. So, first when I like first started being a pro team, I I first started with just playing with friends and we were actually really good. So, we got sponsored before Overwatch League under like some bro, it was called like Hammers Esports and they were like mostly a mobile gaming esports org and for some reason they wanted to sign us and we got $1,000 a month when I was like was at the time 16 or 17. Oh, that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] video games. But then they also sent us carts and crates of Soylent per month. Do you know what Soilent is? Yeah. uses fresh and when we were like scrimming like 6 hours a day cuz I would go to school, come home, take a nap, scrim 6 hours a day, that soilent came in handy cuz I would [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pound that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and keep I don't think it's made its way through your body yet. No, probably not. I was going to say that's why that's why your your translucent bones. So, I had to explain that cuz they had to cosign it cuz I wasn't 18. I couldn't sign it and I had to explain to them, oh, like I'm just doing gaming with some friends that I know and we're really good and they want to pay us money to compete. They didn't really like get it fully, but they they signed it cuz they were like, "Okay, money, sure, why not?" And then when Overwatch League was coming around and teams were getting were picking up players and stuff, they gave me a contract and I needed my parents to sign that cuz I was 17. And then I had to like explain to them, "So, by the way, I got to like fly out to California and I have to do my last year of high school online." and they were a little more like on edge, but then they saw the contract. $60,000 a year with housing and food all paid for. That's crazy. A good deal. I think a boarding school. Yeah. Like exactly what you get for a boarding school. And they were like, "Okay." But my mom was a little more cuz she like my dad, he's more like he knows a little bit more about like tech and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so he's a little more upto-date. So it was easier to convince him, but my mom was like, "Well, I don't know if I want him to go out there. Like I don't really know about this." And your brother's homeless right now with this guy. What is actually your 5'4 brother just fell through the ceiling of the job? You broke all the bones in his body and he just he just wants to text you. You know if you'll be able to complete his course wants you to reply to him and you know you Yeah. Sorry. you were saying. And so eventually like we had a long talk and then I think my dad Did you cry? Did I cry? Yeah. No, I don't think I cried. You're like, "Mom, no." I think she probably did though. She cried. She probably did. We had like a whole like call with the the owner of the team that I was on, San Francisco Shock. And then, you know, my my dad was on it and he talked with all of us and we kind of, you know, they agreed to let me go out there. San Francisco Shock. That was Yeah. Was that team like something else as well? Cuz all the other orgs had to like change their names. That was originally the NRG Esports. They were owned by Shock was owned by NRG Esports. Yeah. So, but then like do I miss it? You miss being a pro? I mean, it was really enjoyable for when I did it, but I think I'm I'm pretty happy now being like streamer. Do you watch pros now? Every once in a while I I try to like keep [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lie, bro. lying. Do you watch now and go like I could hang with these [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] guys? Dude, NA is fried for Overwatch. It is. Who's good? Oh, who's playing Overwatch? Yeah. Do people play this video game you're talking about? Yeah, people still play. People still play, believe it or not. You know what's actually funny? Cuz like when Rivals came out, there was like a big like, oh, like Overwatch killer. But dude, I'm I'm going to be so honest. That game is actually I think they want to sponsor me when I Dude, I I know it's really good. I know how you feel about Marvel Rivals cuz Slime told me and you you were doing a stream and I'm in your chat, dude. Okay, here's the thing. I don't think it's bad for what it is, but it's definitely not. It's like a pseudo competitive game. It's very casual in that sense compared to Overwatch. I was just being evil in your chat. I was like Marvel Rivals Resident Sleeper, you know, this game's ass and you're like, "No, this game's pretty good. This game is actually not bad." Was that during a sponsor or no? It was an hour before your sponsor. Okay. Well, dude, you're evil. You get mad when I do that. Nice. Yeah. Also, at the end at the streamer games, Archie bleeped the entire sentence. Someone came up to Slime and and Slime said, "This is like a bit he does." We were at We got to bleep the one before, too. Just And I was like, "Dude, you cannot. You got to chill." I was like, "Why am I an American?" They want to sponsor this pod. What are you talking about? When we were at EVO, we met up with Brawl Pro, who's a Tekken Street Fighter fighting game. Son talks about him. And he we met up with him and then he goes, "Yo, Brawl Pro is here to meet a 13-year-old Xan player." I'm like, "What is your problem? Why do you why do you just do this?" That's a good dude. Someone gave me their phone and they were like They're like, "Can you say anything?" And so I was like, "What's your name?" They give me their their name. I'm like, "This guy's a pedophile." And then you show him. And then he comes back the next day. He's like, "Could I get a different video?" I like I like asking for another one and I I just ran it back. No, it's a tried and true. I don't know. Dude, that reminds me of when this at EVO years and years ago. I watched some guy come up to Crush who's a Melee player with a with a copy of Melee and he this he's like, "Can you sign my copy of Melee?" And a bunch of people have already signed it. crush just signs across a bunch of names in big text. I can't get back to him. For sure. There was a girl at the streamer games who wanted me to take a video for like her boyfriend who was not there. And I was like, before I take it, is there anything that you know he's not doing enough of that I could I could tell him to do more of? And she was really nervous. She didn't really have an answer. And I was like, what? I started to start the video and I'm like, hey man, so you got you got to cook more for her. And I was saying all these things and she kind of meekly like pipes up. She's like, a beach date maybe? And I'm like, "And you the beach and I want you to take her to the beach." And that's so cute. So, we we'll check it back in on that guy. Someone came up to Super with the San Francisco Shock backpack, which was pretty sick. They were like, "Check it out, bro." And they had him sign it. And it's like and in the same I think it was it was at the crowd near the commentary desk. The same time, uh, someone asked me to sign a copy of Melee. So, I That was really sweet. It's like two two old heads. Yeah. Someone had my jersey. This is so different. I'm sorry. It's so different. They're both equal. They brought both brought the equal professional impact to the game. He's a product of another company versus my jersey. So, you're backto back Overwatch League champion. Slime. Yeah. In his melee tenure. Was close. Didn't get there. Didn't get one championship. What was your highest placement at like a major? What do you Sorry. What do you think his skill level? At like a major, super major, whatever. Like whatever. like we're the big boys. I don't know what he's told you in your age gap conversations. How good do you think he was? How good do I think Slime was? I think I'm going to say well see the thing is I don't know how many people competed back then. Just just maybe maybe like a just give a rank like put a rank there from a traditional honestly he was probably about as good as Brawl Pro was placing at EVO which is like top 49. Top 49 at EVO but for melee. Oh like an overall player. Yeah. Yeah. So like like so you're saying he was top 100 at least? He's saying he's like with that comment he's saying he's a top 150 player. He just said top 100. Top 150 in the world at Melee. Top 100 in the world. Yeah. Top 100. Top 100 in the world. You know what's fun is there's actually a list of only rank out the top 100 players. So it's like And he got the every year. Every [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] year. When were you like actually competing? When the past what is it 11 12 years? Oh, you know what? Now that I think about it, he competed a long time. There's actually a really fascinating stat. There's actually a really fascinating stat about my competition. I forgot about the stat. I don't remember. You brought that off the sticks way back then. Basically, I uh had the top 10 uh charted datadriven ranked amount of losses in tournament of any recorded player. But Michael Jordan has the most shots missed. True. Al also on that list was Squid who was very good. We just went to a lot of tournaments so we were the same. And you and Squid are the same. Uh both French Canadian. How would you describe yourself? How would I describe myself? The real truth about like melee skill. Yeah. Currently or peak. Um like like if we're doing his rhetoric of like Let's do peak. Rich, can you pull up Oh my god. Oh my god, dude. Can you pull up Graves versus Slime? Yeah. B O BC on YouTube. So to your credit, Super, this is a top 100 player. It's actually a top 50 player now. 50 player now. Hold up. Hold up. Hold up. No. And it's a top 50 player. It now. What? Now? Graves has been good for a long time. Yes. And he's top. He was emerging top 100 at that point. He was talented. It's just like, okay, you know what? Pull up this one v one I did against Steph Curry when he was seven. Oh, you think it's like that? Graves was like Steph Curry when he was like 17. Not seven. No way. I would say like a Steph Curry. It's a great So this is me. What year was this? 2022. Yeah, you can take us right to the end. Only a 9minute set. Not much time at all. Look at that one in the top right corner. Yeah, jump to thereish. Slime Slime has one game. He's He's Oh, oh my god. He's just dancing. This is what he's the the neutral by the way. Beautiful. His opponent's red here. Uh He already has one game win. Graves actually didn't get ranked top 100. He got ranked top 50, which is kind of different. And at this time, he was I don't know. It's like kind of better. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] look at that set in the top right. The crowd is meekly clapping, not understand. There's There's a time stamp in the comments. It's 548. And then scroll back up and watch that time stamp. Watch that time. Click that time. 548 com 548. Check Check this out. All right. So, what was going through my mind right here is this guy's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right? And I can do whatever I want. Uh, he bends to my will. Don't worry about that. So, I can do whatever I want to make this guy do whatever I want. Now, check this part out. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Do the splits real quick on him. Why is this the This is the clue. This is Oh, this is rougher than I remember. Wait, wait, wait. This is Wait, this is the dive sample. Oh, this is it. This is it. You ready? This is going to be crazy. Oh, this is atrocious. No, it's this part. This is atrocious. Okay, that's bad. This is really bad. Wait, that jab was really good. Nice job, dude. You're like fumbling all over yourself. No, me is a sloppy game, though. Whoever Whoever time stamped that in the comments, they go back to the time stamp. The jab to clank the side was Okay, no offense. I think that had to be You have to go to 540. He's right after. It's right after I see the time. All right, this part is actually impressive. this part. You don't look impressed. Oh, was that not just a dash attack? Yeah, I dash danced in front of his face for 4 seconds straight. I was dash dancing last night. I'm pretty sure you did a side B and you wanted Super Dash dance. He did lose to me playing with one hand, but he did dash dance. Did you not want to do a side B ledge cancel dare that you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up? Oh, I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it up and I got rewarded. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't care about that part. Like right here. He doesn't care. Don't Don't look at the mistakes. Don't look at the mistakes. That's why I say got rewarded cuz that's Falco Fal. Speaking of melee, Nick was a terrorist of the club last night. Rich, click on the video in the top right hand corner. What's this? Oh god. Click on that video. This is a great video, too. Look at us. This is Aiden versus back when I didn't like him. Who wins this one, man? Why not? No, I liked him. I just didn't know him very well. Who wins this? So, I'm assuming it's Aiden. I like to watch Melee, but I don't know too much. Are there like There's a time stamp again. What are like the the discourse of like honest versus dishonest characters in in Melee? So So a dishonest character in Melee is a character that has like a pretty pretty deep bag of trickery that any good player who spent any time thinking about that character would never lose to it. But none of us put the time into these niche characters. So you win off of this lack of experience based on everyone else. And honest characters like Fox, it's like everyone has the tools to beat Fox. Fox is really good, but everyone knows what those tools are and like those are genuinely good tools. It's not like you can turn it off, Rich. Uh I falcon punch him in the set though, so I technically won the set. Yeah, I agree with that. It's like when Raven like you play a Raven once every 50 games and you're like, yeah, yeah, yeah. And you're like, is this legitimate? No. I think Slime peaked at it was beating Graves is right there. Maybe diamond. Yeah, I'd say I'd say diamond. like a relative rank for people to grasp in Melee. You were diamond. He was a diamond point. Uh like on Slippy, diamond spiritually spiritually within within what we consider diamond collectively. Yeah. Yeah. I say you were d I'll I'll take it. Can I be honest? That's a lot lower than I thought you were going to say. Oh, that's really interesting. Interesting. What did you expect? Well, because if you if you think like, well, I guess Melee doesn't have I don't know how many people play Melee, but if you if you're like top 100, beating a top 100 player, that's like that's worthy of, you know, it is impressive, isn't it? I would say over the years at any given time, if you actually took the whole player base, there's probably between like like 50 and like 250,000 active players, depending on when depending on the time period. That's crazy. There's a lot of players, man. Also, I would run your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in Street Fighter right now. You do run me a Tekken currently, which is fine. And and the thing is there's also a very high skill floor like you found out last night in Melee cuz you did you lose to the Nick. I did one-handed. Uh the one-handed Peach did not lose to anyone in the room. Lewig. So including a player who goes to who I met at Low Tide City. We had goes to tournaments. We had an afterparty for for streamer games. It was at this this this club. It's called Zero Lounge. It's like a '9s club. We had DJ Drizz. Oh, I'm Thank god I didn't go. He was spitting that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Fine. Wait. No. I don't know. Did he play? No. Did DJ Drew? He plays this uh pig slaughter uh house mix and it's just squeaking and blood. He comes up to me. He goes, "Where's TK?" Because the last time he DJed was at my birthday party and TK was like, "Dude, this DJ's ass." And I was like I was like, "What? The DJ's good?" And Terrick's like, "How much you pay?" I was like, "He was free." And he was like, "It sounds like it. Damn, dude. That's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up." And I told Shake about this. And so then Shake this time he's playing all of Terrick's favorite hits, aka just Drake. And he comes to me. He's like, "Where's T? Where's Ter?" He's like I'm like, "He's not here." He's like, "Dude, everyone in the room's like, "Why [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Drake so much?" Come on, man. DJ's got a broken heart and he's in love with Pokemon. Um, but Drake, excuse me, not Drake, but Dre got mogged. Drizz got destroyed at this event. You don't say. Well, it was a two-part. It's supposed to be DJ Drizz into karaoke. the karaoke like person that they hired comes out. Uh she's like, "It's my turn." Kicks Shake off and then starts DJing for 45 minutes. Does not start karaoke. Shake was an opener, bro. Just starts DJing for 45 and then opens up karaoke after 45 minutes. Does the first song herself there's like a list of songs like that 10 people of Q just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] does the first song herself. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kills it. phenomenal singer. She brought her kit in a in a like like a luggage suitcase, not even like a pelican in Mog [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] It like looked cool. And then and then after that, Steve Max walks up to the DJ set and he just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kills it as well. And he's and he and he's doing Simon says cuz it's all he's got, bro. Me and Nut, we like me and Nut were kind of like barely used for the broadcast, which was good because we just got to be funny for like one minute and but we were with Simon says was going and we were doing this bit. We're like, Simon says, "Jerk it." Simon says, "Jerk it." Simon says, "Jerk it. Jerk it." Okay, you're out. Simon says, "Come." We were doing the exact same bit. We We were doing him proposing to his wife and we were like, "Will you marry me?" Simon didn't say, "You're out." We we were also because of like the how weird like the FaZe fan bases were being and how like vicious about the competition, which is fine. We were like I was pretending I was a Lacy stand and that he Steve Max kept calling Lacy out and Simon says. So I'm film I can put it in the intro of this video. But I was basically screaming at Steve Max that I'm a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] killer. The crowd can hear it too. He'd be like, "I'm going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kill you, Steve Mac. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you." And one time he turned back, so I think he heard it. He definitely heard you and shocked into a sneeze into your rib hurting. Yeah, that's what I was going to say. Is that what happened? Like, oh, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] He hates the doctor. I feel my ribs. It hurts really bad. Yeah, you need help, man. I don't like sneezing. So, the surprise is like me trying to stop the sneeze cuz it hurts my ribs super bad. I like how you have a big glowing red spot now like a boss. What? In a in a game. Um, I was going to ask you, do who do you watch, Super TF? Who do I watch? Do you watch anyone? I kind of go around. I tune into your stream when you're live. I tune into your stream sometimes. I like to watch Se Jam, too. I think I think Sejam's like I'm going to be honest, he's like probably one of the most chill people I've met. Sejam is just like that guy is there to You ever met Seam? Uh, have I met him? Yeah, I've met him. I mean, he he did commentary. Do we? Oh, yeah. First time. The first one. He didn't get to do the second one, but the first one. Um, and I just kind of tune into like my friends that are live. I don't know cuz like I I end really late. So, like I end stream, I eat food and I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm going to bed. Why do you stream at such gross hours? Cuz you stream starting at what time for you? Like 8, 8:30, sometimes 9:00. And then you're ending at like 4:30. 4 in the morning. Yeah, I stream late. I should stream earlier. What is your What is your life surrounding streaming like right now? Um, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Well, brother, I live in [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Philly and I don't do [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out there. I was telling him maybe like I was thinking about He wants to become an LA. Well, I don't know about an LA influencer. I don't know about LA. No, Philly's cool. That's where I just did the poppers. Oh, that's that's awesome, bro. Hot tubs and poppers and hot tubs and poppers. That's probably the only two things you could do there. I'm going to go to LA to get gates. You say you say like I'm in Philly. I don't do [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out there. It's like Philly is an easy place to do things. What I mean is like there's not like like no streamers are out there. I can't do anything with the only people on the East Coast is Squeaks and he's in New York. So like Yeah. It's kind of tough. But like the reason why I'm out there is cuz family's there, which is like always nice to be near family and stuff. So, but I don't know. Like I would think like maybe like trying like Vegas or something because I know people that live in Vegas. Walk me through a day, right? So we know when you stream. Yeah. When do you wake up? Go to bed at 4 in the morning. When do you wake up? Like rather like maybe 12:30 to 2. Somewhere in between there. 12:30 to 2 p.m. Yeah. I'm going to guess it's more on the more on the two. The other side. More on the two, but sometimes 12:30. You're waking up. The sun's beaming through the window. What about like what about like steps like more than more than 500 steps? Keep going. I'll pull it up. Let's see if I can if I can get the uh the Samsung health out here. Hold up. Oh my god. It's going to say steps. Why you don't have a case that does not match the Oh yeah, dude. Everyone's giving me [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for this. So my case, by the way, is like Yeah, it just falls out. Yeah, everyone's giving me [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for being like really rich and buying the wrong case, dude. No, it's not that it's the wrong case. The case broke a while ago. Probably like 6 months ago. Uh, probably a year ago, I'll be honest. And I haven't gotten one. But the reason why I'm not getting one now is cuz I'm going to get a new phone soon. And I've been saying that for a few months. This is the outer shell. Yeah. This is the outer shell of what the case is supposed to be. Yeah. Outer box. Yeah. Yeah. And so I just haven't got it because I'm lazy. How many steps do you have? One question is why the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do you even keep it on? Yeah. What the It's just useless. It's fun to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] around with. It's like a fidget toy. It's a sting toy. You're stmming. Anyways, do you have autism? Probably. Okay. So, you wake up at 2 p.m. You stim. Let's see. Like if I go to like last week, let's go like let's just see your monthly average. All right, August 6th, we got 900 steps. Let me see. Can I see? Oh, yeah. Just flip through the uh the days. So, he's done it for for the month. I'm going to keep going through this. Please keep asking them, y'all. Um anyways, so I wake up and then I'll probably pick my ass for like I don't know 30 minutes maybe, then shower, brush my teeth. I do cuz my parents live so close. I do visit them. Visit kick your ass and you brush your teeth. Yeah. I mean, shower whatever it is. And then I live close to my parents, so I will go over there a couple times a week. Uh, hang out there for a little bit. I'll come home, chill for a bit, and then I will Are you going there for a free meal? Not entirely. But that's part of it. But that's part of it. That's part of it. Not entirely. I spend some food. I spend quality time there, which I You know what? They They want me to come over, too. Are you doing the dishes? He's not doing the dishes. He's not doing the dish. That's quality time. Okay, I'll tell you what, though. Me and my dad have a ritual where we have a little mocha pot that makes espresso and then I clean the pot and make espresso for us every night after dinner. That's our little like thing we do. Wow. Very Italian of you guys. So then after dinner then after dinner I hang out for a bit and then I go back to my place, chill for a little bit, get ready, whatever. Your parents every night? Not every night. A couple times a week. Is your family Italian? My dad was born in Italy. My mom was born here. Does he sound like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] de? Well, no, because he he moved here when he was like a baby, but like his parents are from they're both Italian. Yeah. Uh 1,200 average monthly average. His average is 1,200. It spikes in the winter times. Then he gets to about 4 or 5,000. Well, wait. Wow. Why? In the in the winter. In the winter months, you seem to closer to 4 or 5,000. And but in the in the Do you want trips? No. At Christmas time? No, I don't. The rest of the year, maybe he's just shaking it more. the rest of the year he's around 125 1500 which is it's not great that's not great it's low okay well no I think at the lowest no four digits we've seen low I think Emmy Red Bull athlete ruin we're going to have some respect put on her name today a day nothing but respect for my go but she's just got to move more she's got to move more she became a Red Bull athlete with that number is that is pretty beast uh and then you stream. And then what do you do after stream? I take a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like two to three times a day, by the way. Two to three. Anyone here can Can you Anyone come close to that? I'm like somewhat specific. I am specifically the furthest I could be from that opposite. I would do like two to three a week. Well, uh, recently it's been like been like once a week. Isn't that crazy? You're like constipated. You need more fiber or something. He used to only take a poop at the college he went to cuz the the toilets were powerful enough to take it all. Funny enough, this is like little side comment. Those bathrooms like I saw him the first day. I was like luxury [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] toilets. Yeah, right. Get a get a grip. And then I went inside the second day, dude. They had the AC blasting super clean. You saw the portaotties that we that we had for the event. Yeah, they were like little like vans that they had out and I was like, "Yeah, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] luxury toilets. Sure, they are luxury, but they are luxury at home. I don't have a You want to send me one? Okay, funny story about a bet. You hold that thought. You owe me money, so think about that. Um, hold that thought. First time I had a day was we moved into a new place for uh the second season of Overwatch League was like 2019. And the h we like rented two different houses. And the house we were in was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] gorgeous. It was up in like Studio City in the hills or whatever. I actually have a picture of my bedroom view. I'll pull that up real quick. But um they had a bet installed and I was like, "Oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a bet. Let me try it out." Because I never fountain. I never I never used one. So I sat down on the toilet and it was full pressure and it shot straight up my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] So I fell forward on my knee. Hold on. I fell forward on my knees off the toilet and then it continued to spray on my back as I cuz it it took me by such surprise. And from that day, I have been extremely It sprayed on your back. It sprayed on back shot from a toilet. Did it go in a towel for you at least? Why did you get blown up from a bed? I was like, "Oh my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] god." Treat you like that. I I am not kidding. I'd pay 40 grand to see that as a video. I do need an animation of a bedet just blasting you upwards. Yeah, you probably weigh likeund. That is a beautiful view. Absolutely gorgeous view. Damn. Beautiful. It's a nice I just probably didn't get any more steps anyways. When When did you uh When did you quit Overwatch? Like when did you 2021 is when I stopped being a pro. When did you call it? Like why? So Overwatch one they had like a like the two two and a half years where like they basically let the game [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rot in the sun like a melon. And um they got no updates. They only had like a balance patch maybe every few months. It was really bad. And so, but that was because they had Overwatch 2 coming out and they were like promising all this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Oh, PVE is going to be big, new heroes, all this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] And the alpha that they gave the Overwatch League players before the next season was I mean, I'm going to say it was dog [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Like, it was it just didn't feel responsive. Like, the the met at the time, like in the alpha, was really bad. And then I was playing it and I was like, you know, something is just kind of off. Like, it didn't feel And we're playing it. Were you still good? Yeah, like I was I was good. I was like, you know, we were scrimming, practicing, whatever. But it it I don't know. Something didn't it wasn't clicking the same. And so I tried it a bit and I was like, I don't know if I can put in like 100%. Because like I'm not going to play another year if I'm not going to be like if I'm going to be like halfassing it cuz that's just unfair to like my teammates and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right? Like there's no no reason to do that. So it just didn't click and you're like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it, I'm out. And then I was a little nervous about full-time streaming though. I was a little nervous because I was streaming for like a while at that point. Were they still calling you like twink boy and being mean back then? Oh yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah. I mean, yeah, that was kind of always sort of a thing. What What proved that, do you think? Why Why your being a twink boy? That's part of it. You think just being a twink is caused to get bullied? But I think like Preszo doesn't get bullied. Preso is not a twink. He's not. Too thick to be a twink. Too thick to be a damn twink. He was. He was. Now he's a twink. Oh, he was. Yeah, it was a dream. I don't know. I think it's kind of I think it's kind of how you like respond to things too. People always say like Char flex a streamer. That's kind of like a common sentiment. So like you know I play into it too. It's not like it's a one-way street. Um well now they'll have more ammo now. They know you left your brother homeless. I know XQC. He was pretty good back then. He was actually good. Yeah. I wouldn't say he's top one or anything, but he was like pretty good for at the time. But like people have gotten so much better now. He hasn't played in so I've never played Overwatch. That's a lie. Uh finish your thought actually before I call you out. Well, I did do about like 10 duo games with Connor for our challenge. There you go. And I watched some of those games. I because people are like, "Oh my god, I love to explain Overwatch." I'm like, "Let me see what this is about." And you look like you probably never held a mouse before. I'm going to be honest. I'm probably the worst Overwatch player alive. And I'm not I'm not exaggerating. Okay, that's not true. I forgot I have Overwatch highlights. Should I share one? Yes. I used to play console Overwatch. That's fire. It's a game I said I would never play just cuz I had never played it and uh and I was like I'll just keep it this way. To this day I've never played. I was going to be like one of those people who have never watched Star Wars and then they just keep not doing it so they can say they never watched Star Wars. That's where I am. That's where I am. And then I tripped into playing it and I regretted it immensely. You didn't have fun. I Well, no. Super. I did not. I killed myself and I yelled and I punched and I screamed. Was there like a like a Bobby Kodic situation where you have to go into his like office and like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like like jerk him off? No, that never happened actually. I never I never met Bobby Bobby. You never met that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] freak of a man. Sports. You heard it here first. No, I never did. God, they they just they just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up Overwatch League so bad. like Overwatch in general, the whole like 2019 to 2021, 2022, they just like completely suck. Are they bouncing back? Is it coming back? I you know, believe it or not, I actually do think so. I think like the current dev team and leadership like they are releasing heroes and stuff and they're like releasing maps. They have like new this new like big game mode that they came out with which is pretty fun. It feels like a Valerant CS situation with what? Rivals. Well, yeah, like with rivals in Overwatch because I feel like CS Did CS not go a little crazier in updates after Valerant was released? They might have. Not really. CS2 happened after it. No, for years. They worked on it for years. Like before Valerant was a thing. Yeah. I mean, I don't think CS2 was a response to Valerant. No, I think they were going to make it eventually. What I'll say is though, the the original Overwatch dev team, like they had a vision of not making it a live service game cuz they dropped one they planned to drop one new hero after the game came out and like that was it. Done. Which is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy cuz it won game of the year in 2016. Yeah. So like to have this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] IP that's a cash cow and then just like eh, you know what? Maybe we won't do anything with it is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy. Yeah. They added more characters to Mario Kart than Overwatch. They added every everyone to Mario Kart there now. That's true. They even have fun costumes for Luigi. Oh, we're not going to have sound. Yeah, we don't we don't need sound for it, though. I can tell what's going on. I can I can I can visualize it. Can you cast it? Maybe. I can I can I can see what's going on. Okay, so this this clip is just called Clutch. Clutch. Is this your clip? Yeah, this is my clip. How old is this? I uploaded it in 2016. Holy. On console. On console. Overwatch. I was playing Tracer. Okay. Um and how old am I? So, I'm in college. This is my junior year of college. This is probably when I met slime. Yeah. 1 minute and 32 seconds. Oh, I would love to see this. Okay, Lang coming out of spawn. Triple blink. Probably up. Unless maybe this is the highest. You go up top. Yeah, it probably is. It is. Wow. That's fine. I I know what's happening here. Okay, he shoots at nothing. You see the Farah on point? Wait, wait, wait. We're going to lose though, right? No. Well, that's what it's looking like. Diva out of me. You can probably get a kill. Old trance looks weird. Okay, nice. Baby D.Va down. You have pulse bomb. Maybe you go for the Zen after trance is my guess. Uh looking for it. You okay? Two people walk into your Pokemon. You dropped the spray on the point. Zen's out on the coast. You blink out of Nice. Farah's getting healed. Huge. Zen can't hit a shot on you to save his life. Melee. No. No. Quick melee. Misses his melee. 5k. And you almost got the overtime wick burn, but you got on it just in time. Come on now. Come on now. I mean that's decent. 2016 console Overwatch. Was this before they had a ranked mode? Do you remember? I'm just kidding. Was this Yeah. Was this plumbers, bro? I Okay. I think there was a ranked mode cuz I remember I remember distinctly there was like a top 500 or something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Cuz the game launched. Oh, 10 player kill streak, y'all. Oh my god. Look how Look how hype he is, too. He's like swinging swinging his stick around melee. That's okay. This is This is This is calm cuz it's pretty good, right? How's my skin? That's a good skin. I like that one. Here be your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to Overwatch characters. Be real. Okay. Can I be so honest? I think that joke is so overdone. Cuz I've looked at it like I' I've been like, "Okay, well, you got to look. You got on Wednesday with his big [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] huge [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out." What do you mean this joke? This is a question. Fun fact, did you know gorillas actually have small penises? Yes. That is that is real. Didn't know that. They have like two inch penis on average. That is real. Well, anyway, you can look at that. Whales have big penises. What? This is not a joke, Sub. Have you done it? Well, I've looked at it and I'm like, I got to see what's going on here. Cuz you heard about it so much because Yeah, people always talk about it. I'm like, okay, let's come on. Let's get active. And I looked and nothing really impressed me. I was like, that's what like that's sort of like I see it, but I'm not like I'm not I'm not moved. It doesn't it doesn't cause a reaction like like somebody in a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] museum like just looking at Winston's large [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Yeah. I just uh it didn't move me. It didn't move. The artist has no passion. It didn't evoke a reaction. Not to say that some of the art isn't good cuz some of it is good. It's art. It's well drawn but there's no meaning behind what they're doing. Is Overwatch a top five unintentional Gooner game? I Well, it might be that the Gooner part is overrated. I personally think so. But to be overrated, you kind of have to be in the top five. Sure. I guess you're in the conversation, right? Yeah, that's true. M. So the answer is no. No. Cut or uncut? Me. You're a penis. Oh, I'm cut. Yeah. Welcome to the Welcome to the Right Side of History. Are you cut? We're uncut. Oh, you're both are uncut. They're cut. This is the cut. European want to be European. Do you does like Okay. I've always wanted to ask someone who's uncut. Sure. Do you have to spend like a little bit extra time washing the hood? Washing the hood. It's not like it's not like you're like like lifting the hood and you're like there. I get it. You have to take your finger and go in it like you know you don't have a toothbrush or you know you know it's like when you wash a cup do you want to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] know how it is? Ask your brother what it's like cleaning a HVAC pipe cuz that's what I'm doing every take your brother out of the hood man being serious about that. Yeah the citizens at Philadelphia forgot. Okay. So, if you if you could pick one game now that you could be the best at or pro at? I thought he was going to say you could jerk off, too. Yeah, I really thought so, too. And I was thinking about my picks. Uh, yeah. One game that you'd want to be best in the world. Yeah. What? Like, what what games do you look at that other people play that you think are I wish I could be good at Tekken. I wish I could wave dash like five times a second into like deep dash electric into like crazy mix at the corner. We were talking at EVO and it was I was basically like how often do you practice Street Fighter or fighting games super? I haven't practiced that much recently to be honest. And you you just don't practice and that's really part of it and you just you cuz you queue and you want to just goon out and play ranked. Okay, that's another thing. He thinks the character I play is a gooner character which I completely Can you just say your character's name and nothing else? Raina. Uh, Rich, can you look up arena Tekken? Raina Tekken re ei. We We've We've talked about this, but like you can be good at Tekken. You just have to sit and do the boring learning. Ah, but dude, like my fingers like doing waved at like this is not a Gooner character. Look at the first picture. The very first picture. It's not a Goonar character. How is this Goonar? It's not. It's not. No, it's not. It's not a Goonar character. Slime is actually crazy. Look up Nina from Tekken. Is that who Slime plays? That's who Slime plays. Whoa. Look at the second the second picture. The second picture. That's what she looks like in Tekken 8. Oh my god. You don't need to cut the shirt open like that in a minute. You're a Gooner, man. You're said I think he projects onto other characters. You're projecting. I'm not projecting. You have a Goonar. That's like Tekken. I will say we play the same character in Street Fighter. Who? You play the Street Fighter game. We both play Cammy. That's a Goonar character. Cammy's different. I put the most amount of clothes on my Cammy that you can. I use costume three. That's true. He's respect or [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bones costume two. Yeah, that's just that's just pure goon. Can you look up Ivy from Soulcal? It would be the fifth or one, two, fifth picture. Yeah. So use standard costume one. I use I don't know what. Yeah, it cost No, this was the original Goon character. Well, can you look up Amumu rule 34? I just want to see what's up. Yeah. Yeah, we'll see. I do want to see I want to see. Wait, hold on. That's a child, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Oh, is it? You freaky frog. He's a mummy. He's a kid. He's a mummy. He's a thousand years old. He's a child. He's a mummy. [Applause] Get us out. Get us out. Get us out. Get us out. Get us out. I'm not looking. No. No. No. No. No. What? Wow. But so you'd want to be the best at it. I have I have a great stream idea for you. What's that? You do the SuperTF Pakistan boot camp. You go to you go to Long for two weeks. Oh, then maybe you buddy know Door Dash there, so you try some food and local food. Are you a heavy Door Dasher? I Well, Hoober Eats. Okay. I do a couple times a week. I might. I might. A couple times a week. That's it. Super TF. Yeah, cuz I mean I got my parents. Okay. Yeah. To to Supra's credit, he he played I I talked about it, I think, on the pod, but at at EVO, he played a a set in tournament against one of the best NA Oh, that is true. probably the best NA Tekken players. I took game one. He took game one. It was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy. It was crazy. It was crazy. Arsen Ash. No, NA. North America. North America. Where do you think Arsen Ash is from? America. He's not the best on the best person should be from America. Not in Tekken, bro. Dude, you know Jess Andy? I'm sorry. I slapped your Jess Andy was at Games. Really? Yeah. Isn't that crazy? Who's in Andy? Jess Andy is a one of the best NATO players. He just thought it was cool. Is that who you beat? No, I beat uh Ninja Killer. And Yeah. And it was You got 23rd or 25th at Tekken. So it was crazy, bro. You got 24th then by Spirit. No, I got uh 513th. Oh, I do feel like FGC players entered. Tekken was like 2500. Oh, you're you're not you're your ass. Yeah, Do you think like the the FGC collectively has just some of the worst tags like compared to other esports? No, I I cuz it's like Ninja Killer, Brawl Pro, Angry Bird. Like Angry Bird sucks, but Big Bird is cool. Big Bird is pretty. Big Bird's a cool tag. Angry Bird is a bad tag. No disrespect, right? It's f It doesn't mean they're not good at the game. It's just relative. It's like in League it's like Faker. How much respect you just gave a Tekken player? Like no disrespect. I don't Your name's Sorry, Street Fighters. Oh, your name your name's K. No disrespect. Yeah. Yeah. He doesn't know how there's like a pathetic little dude. That person's a pedophile. I don't know them. When they're good at a game he plays, he he's like he swears feelalty. A pathetic jester in the court. Do you know who has the sickest alias for any esports player? Posasha biceps. Tell me that's not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy. That's not That's That's not bad. Which game has the best Which game has the best tag overall? It's Brood War. I think Koreans in general just have the the tag game on lock. They kind of do. And I I don't even think they just pick awesome English words sometimes. And they're always simple. It's like knight. No, but that's and you're like, damn, that's like the best mid laner. It's like snow. Snow with like a uppercase O, but he's But he's also the best. So it's kind of sick. It's funny though cuz like a tag like that is only a good tag if you're really good. Yes. I feel like most tags are that though. Like no, cuz you can see you can see like a really funny tag. It doesn't matter how good you are and it's just that's a good tag. Sure. I got into a rockets debate. I need you to settle it. A debate. Yeah. Okay. Who would win? Joey Chestnut, USA bolt. They're doing a 100 meter dash before running. They have to eat an entire hot dog. Just one. Just one. Can I jump in here real quick? I'll say I had one I was on one side of this fence and then I got I got a severe talking to at streamer games. What? And I was I was changed. Rose and Taborn from Sole. What What does eating a hot dog? That's a great question. What does that entail? Do they have to just put it in their mouth, swallow a whole They finish the entire hot dog and then they run. The answer is obviously Joey Chestnut. I think Joey Chestnut to eat cuz he's going to swallow that thing one one [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] only 100 meters. 100 meters 100 meters. Yeah. Yeah. He I actually think he starts running before Usain B. He finishes before Usain Bull starts running. I don't know if I don't know if I agree with that. That's crazy. But I do think Joey Chestnut Let's back up. Nick, how long do you think it would take for you to eat a hot dog? Me? I mean, I've got It's one of the competitive ones, so they're like pretty big. Throat goat. And you only do one and you know it's a contest for a billion. So you're really trying a whole maybe like a little over a minute. What? Bro, I can eat one in like 4 seconds. I'm a slow eater. I'm I'm crazy. All the bread. I taste how fast I eat. I There's bread in this too. Bread. Yes. Oh, you're not eating just a I thought it was just the dog. No, it's hot. Dude, I thought it was just the dog. I'm like a full on is they they you ever see them? They like dip like it's so nasty. They like dip it in water from here. They just The thing is that's not like a forbidden tech. You can just do that. Well, that's you got to be like that. You got to be a billion and you're sitting there for a minute. Like what are you putting mustard on? I'm doing it for a Yeah, I guess. for a billion dollars and you're sitting there for a minute going I think Joey just I think he clears so fast. Let me By the way I'm about to blow this whole [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] open. You think Usain's not a real eater? No, he has to be. I think he is a real he we runners we found out eat [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 6,000 calories a day. He's obviously eating. I think Joey Chest does not get this crazy advantage. But he Joey Chess also has to be working out. You could be a real The thing is he could be a real eater. You you could be a real eater, but I could be a you know, somebody could be a real runner and get dusted by using Can you try to find a video while we're talking of like a a pro hot dog eater versus an amateur and just see I think a good question is too, how much of a lead does Joey Chestnut need before it's like he only needs Okay, this is what we me this is the math is that if he's in even remotely decent shape, he could probably run the 100 meter in like 15 seconds. So that means Bolt's fastest 100 meter he ever did was like 9.58. So you need like a 4 head start. Okay, now I get it. So Bolt needs to eat this dog in faster than 6 seconds. But I think here's what I think. I think I'm within like 6 seconds of a Joey Chestnut hot dog. No, no, I disagree. I think I disagree in semi-prover. Okay, I'm counting the time. This is Nick on the left. This is Nick on the left for a billion dollars covering his mouth while chewing. Oh, I guess I'll just have this part of it. Okay, she's not trying. She is not trying. So, you can soak it like that. That's what I was saying. They they dunk it in water to soak the I didn't have the visual in my head. I didn't I could by And this guy I mean No, I don't. He's probably But I'm You saying Bolt can do this? You say it's so funny that they put semi-pro in the title. You think you don't think you can eat a hot dog? I don't think you can get it down like if you're getting and think about it. You're getting like bubble bath checked on the way out. Here's my problem. Lewig says he thinks he could eat a hot dog within 6 seconds of Joey Chestnut. I don't believe that. I think I think with genuinely 1 hour of training, I could drop my hot dog eating time. Changing the training about Oh, we're throwing in training. Okay. Okay. How about this? Who wins the Joey Chestnut Usain Bolt race? Joey Chestnut or Usain Bolt after some training? That's a good question. We all like that. It does. It does betray the idea of spirit. I'm basically saying like like sorry just watching that my hot dog time is probably going to be like 10 seconds. I am not no tra not eating a hot dog. I'm just saying knowing the form. Let's go get you a hot dog after this. I I want to put this to the test. I think I could out eat all of you right here right now and I'm one hot dog time. No, you definitely could. I lose by maybe the hardest. I don't think I do. I think you're the one that thinks you're trying to take a I step to you. I I think I dusted you. I think I dust you for like four seconds. And I'm gonna say this right now. Grab this 200. We're talking to you. I'll get a hot dog. This is 200. We're talking. We're gonna go get a hot dog after this. We're going to do it. I'll get a hot dog right after this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] And I'm going to prove that Usain would win cuz I think he can eat as fast. You're team Usain. Yes. Cuz I think he can eat a dog as fast as I can. And I don't think that Joey, he's not like a cartoon character. He can go and it just goes down. Pretty close. It's basically what it's You guys are acting like it goes down his throat [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sideways. Can we see Can we see Joey Chestnut one hot dog? You never get to see one, brother. Look at the way he's pounded that four. It was three bites and then he started not come within 6 seconds of that. I'm just saying it's only one dog. This is his like fifth dog. That's what I'm saying. You can't do that. Oh, this guy. No, you can't. This guy's putting too much flare into it. It's a lot of technique. Okay, first off, don't talk about Kobayashi that way. He's not He's putting too much flare into it. Oh my god. 7 seconds in 20 hot dogs. He's got hot dog juice all over the Y3. No. No. There's no way. One hot dog. So it takes him like like what? Reasonably 4 seconds, 5 seconds to clear a hot dog. Yes. Cuz he's not like obviously he's putting more. It's like every 3 seconds he puts a hot dog in. I think 4 seconds is fair. I think it would suck to eat that many hot dogs for it to be cleared. Yeah. I think I can do it in 10 seconds. Yeah, I think that's a time you're just bad at it. That 10 seconds wouldn't get you there. If I see any damn food in that mouth ate it in 10 seconds, it wouldn't He'd be losing. He would He would lose. He needs to eat the dog faster than six. He needs to 5 seconds or under. That's what he would need to do. I don't think I don't think he's pulling off 15 15sec 15sec 100 meter. I don't think he's doing a 15sec 100 meter. You don't think Joey Chestnut can run a 15? You're not factoring in that this 100 meter is not a block start. It is a 100 meter starting hot dog for post hot dog standing upright. Okay, but you also concern one hot dog that Joey Chestnut is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nothing. That's literally nothing. 100 meters you saying Bolt is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nothing. Okay, but how B is going to clear 100 meters in probably like 107 even post hot dog and Joey Chess's going to do like a 19 second 100 meter. 19 is crazy. You know how old Joey Chess is? You guys are acting like a grain of salt taken from Reddit, but an elite 100 meter time would be like 10 seconds. Yeah. This person broke it down into like like By the way, Usain I think is 38. Well, I mean, granted, he's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] world Olympian, but yeah, I think we're all assuming. The way this person broke it down is a complete beginner is anything above 12 seconds. So 15 seems very complete beginner off the block running track. Not a complete beginner aka a 41year-old whose job it is to eat hot dogs. Hold on. We did the 100 meter. We did the 100 meter at streamer games last year with the fans, right? No block start. Those people were Those people were coming in under 16 seconds for sure. Yes, but it is like Wait, this is it. Wait, this is literally it. What? Wait, they took 10 seconds. That's a kill basa. That's a kill basa. That's a kill basa. Don't freak out. He ate a kilbasa. Oh my god. Yeah, you think this boy's running in 15. This guy's still going. Look at this boy run. 15 seconds. My [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ass. Look at this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] slug moving around the field. I like how he got What second did he slowing down? Did he start? What second did he finish the food? That was a 30sec 100 meter dash. No, it took him 10 seconds. I'm telling you right now, it took him 10 seconds. It's timing the whole thing. It took him 10 seconds to eat the whole kbasa. I told you. A 25second 100 meter dash is what he did. No, he did 20 second. 20 second. If it was 10 seconds and ended at 34. No, 31. Well, watch again. So, he's eating the Kilbasa. Oh my god. No, by the way, keep that in mind. No bun Kabasi. No bun Kabasi takes 10 seconds. Starts at right at 10. So, it's 21 seconds. Look at that, man. Okay. Okay. I'll give you this little He's a lot slower. I hate this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 15sec thing. No, he also has a massive lead. Yes. Yes. Against Marty. We're talking Don't worry about Marty. No, but that's what I mean. He doesn't have to do anything harder than jogging to win this credentials. Wait, he didn't look You don't think he You don't think he tries a little harder on the line? He's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You don't think he And you don't think Also, al also hold on. The best eater in the world. The best eater in the world just took 10 seconds to get that down. without a hot dog. Kasa, do you think Bolt's really able to down a hot dog in under even with this time? Right. That means Bolt still has to eat it faster than 10 seconds. I'm going to say he definitely was not going full strength on that eating. He's I've seen him pound. It's crazy. The Joey chest apologists are actually insane. I'm giving you I'm giving you everything. I'm giving you I'm giving you everything. You're right. You're right. He's so slow. That's the fastest he can possibly run. Bull eat a hot dog then faster than 10 seconds. Can he he based off that he can take 20 seconds? What? Okay, look. Subtract what you think the time would be from that time for a hot dog. So the 10 seconds for the kilbasa, what do you think he eats a hot dog in? Joey Chestnut. I think Joey does a hot dog way quicker. 5 seconds most, right? So chop 5 seconds off of his time. That's 15 seconds. And I think I think you I think he can do it in 5 seconds and then it took him 20 seconds to run this 100 meter. I think Usain Bolt it takes him 10 seconds to eat the hot dog. Well, that's what I mean. You have to be confident that Usain Bolt is going to eat the hot dog in under 10 seconds. You need to be correct in the best of circumstances. If I can eat a hot dog in [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 10 seconds, then I'm proven right. Which I disagree with. By the way, I could do it faster than him and he's only asking for 10. I also think the water strat is it's it's taking like two to three seconds off and I don't think Usain Bolt's going to nail the water strat. I think no water for either side. I think I think I can do water strat first try. I've never tried it. You just dunk it in water and eat it and get over the fact that it's yucky. It's not yucky. I can't wait to watch you guys eat hot dogs. I'm going to smoke load. We're all going to eat hot dogs. All of us. All of us are going to eat hot dogs. All of us. I'm like, Damn. Yeah, it's going to be awesome. Oh, man. I can't believe [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Marty had to be the one. We needed a better runner, though. I need I show speed to do it. I show You think I Show Speed would lose? No. He could do anything fast. Would Would he lose to Joey Chestnut in this challenge? No. Yes. No. I show Speed would crush this. He would crush it. I I feel like I'm glad we're on the same Hold on. You think eating off Usain Bolt would lose, but not No, I think they would both win. I think Usain Bolt would win. I've been saying this all day and I think and Speed would win. Yes, both would win. Oh, you don't think Joey would win? Yes. Oh, my bad. My bad. I'm team. I'm team Joey. Yeah, you three 20-year-old lack of wisdom, lack of heart. 30-year-old. Welcome to UNK mode, I guess. Put her there. We You did the You did the white guy at the office face. I was going to say that was the whitest [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Okay, we're at a hot dog stand. We got four hot dogs. Got four men. And we're going to see how quickly we can pound them. We're going have to do a post timer. Our chief can throw a timer on for us. Sure. These are regulation dogs. And we're not doing a water strat. Two. One. Go. Way longer than I thought. Oh my god. I have about 29 seconds. You're not done. Dude, I didn't even have water. I ran this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dry. Well, I'm catching up. What? What I realiz is your throat muscles start to give out. I just don't have strong throat. Like if I'm eating like this for a long time, it'll f You're still not done. I'm so sorry, Joey. Joey, Joey, I'm so sorry. Well, it turns out it's harder than we thought. Okay. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Okay. Do you revise your opinion? There you go. On the debate, dude. I think I stand strong. No, I think my mind has changed. I was like almost 30 minute 29. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Super. Anything you want to say, man? I had a lot of fun. You I was actually a little nervous. I was like, "Damn, what if I come on here and I just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bomb this shit?" Either way, you did. And when you leave, we will we're going to be like like, "Damn, don't ever invite that guy back." If you did well or bomb, your chat would say the same thing. That's true. That is true. One final question cuz I forgot to ask this. Do you think Cena was a good team captain? I do. I do think she was a team. Well, let's end on that. Yeah. Thank you all very much for watching.
