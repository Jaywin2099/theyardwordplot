really good that yeah that was we should have fight him let's I he's walking into a coffee shop with a one a bomb on your chest but also a a a GoPro to record you threatening a barista is that illegal to record them it's not a private conversation that's not private conversation that's public conversation and you deserve to be in there with a bomb in your chest the bomb is the bigger issue in this circumstance not even on it's not even on it's just on your not on it's on my body it's not on could it blow up anything blow well it's a bomb it could blow up of course then but it's not armed and on it's not like on and you got is it visible yeah very says bomb it would be an act of terrorism and it says bomb is on but it's because I I was like painted on I can't change that it is off I think if

so it's a double stupid they wouldn't know it's fake if it said bomb is on i' be yelling I have a fake bomb fake bomb not on it's as bomb as on you'd still get in trouble by who the police the government yeah I wouldn't call them I have a bomb why would I call Poli you're not the one call everyone else in the coffee Shop's calling them the cops wouldn't mess with I would activate an EMP you have an EMP so I would say I've activated the EMP you're literally just a domestic terrorist no I'm buying coffee terrorist [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you keep talking about terrorist activating an EMP no he's
