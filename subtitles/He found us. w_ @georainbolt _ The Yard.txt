good reason do you want to hear it uh yeah he went to the beautiful store bought everything uh no I was driving my K truck and it's unregistered it doesn't have a license plate and I saw a cop on the highway so the long way I saw a cop in the left lane pull to the highway I said I don't want to be next to that guy I will get arrested I will be arrested for this this is so illegal they're not going to pull you up I don't think you'll get arrested I don't even have a license plate I don't have a side mirror he was trying not to be more late yeah thank you thank I made I made an executive decision you weigh weigh the potential cost of driving by the car which is a way worse SC area if L controlled the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] economy it would make geogas her so much harder okay it's a k truck on a on a road that looks like it goes to is McDonald's after ice cream Li plates are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yellow bro also you like he is wearing I've never smelled him so dude why do you smell he's wearing like an extra special cologne I'm not kidding dude he's trying to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you had we've had so many guests on the show and you're getting treated he's prepared for you the most this is actually beautiful I'm honored yeah I mean okay you know I you just play the game I like really really good and you make funny video why did I start playing the game oh that's a good question I would like slime to listen to this he started playing the game from a video that that me and G wizard made together exactly that is I vividly remember the exact scenario I what was it I don't even remember you guys were just playing he was like blindfolded and I remember he made that specific Greece Island call out oh yeah Chia chavia something I don't remember the exact Island but sure yeah yeah yeah and then I was just like on the couch watching it I'm like holy crap and then and I I raised up and I went to my laptop I'm like let's go crazy I locked in he go so much better than me in about six months and then so much so much better than me in the years that followed uh you recently did the world cup thing that was crazy oh okay I was having an argument because I watched this with Nick Yingling who yelled out Ohio every round yeah I have Ohio B my T yeah let him Express himself that is the spam and he's doing the spam are you as good as the people on the stage that's a question everyone asks is it true are you no okay and you're will say that I'm the first to admit it okay yeah yeah there's probably like multiple like people you could compare me to in like other like spaces but um this was my this was my guess when we talked about you coming on do do you follow Chess at all do you know who Levy is oress yeah like he is amazing at chess he's a very very good but he's not as good as Magnus Carlson or like a 12-year-old but because he's so good because he's so good and because he has a YouTube channel and he's good at speaking about the game he's really good for like like Talent evaluating and like presenting the game to people and I was like that seems kind of I'll take that comparison yeah yeah I get compared to him a lot in like the in the in the same way I will say like the way the World Cup format 2 it favors not my play style so like the World Cup is like what does that mean I'm sorry what does that mean your play style you just click on guesser play style so there's three formats right like moving no move npz could I compete in the World Cup if it was npz only npz upside down it's black and white and you only get to see it for half a second the more R the better npz for just like you get one still shot like one photo you can't move oh like the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you that you go insanely viral for yeah cuz that's all I really play I don't practice anything else dude they were lowkey horrible at in the World Cup like but that map was impossible was it a custom map it was a custom map for the World Cup that whoever made that map was like hating these [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are good look B they had like weird ass like single person roads in Brazil and it was they spend the whole minute just clicking around sadly just trying to guess where it was I like them finding like you said like it's like Brazil and then you're just there's a k truck there and just like making some sort of like AI yeah planted [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up image throw you off the scent and you just have to actually have bed down that road yeah you need to get in big Google listen rainbow it's great to have you on lewick smells amazing because of you today awesome but I want to make I'm trying to understand I'm trying to contextualize all this cuz I am a professional Super Smash Brothers player and Tekken player you're not sorry he's lying to you no you're laughing you're lying he's not a professional live laugh lie is that what we do here at Bed Bath and Beyond I'm trying my new [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] friend you're acting like he doesn't know anything what like you're acting like he doesn't know anything about anything like he just look at you and be like yeah you're probably a professional you did recognize me in the parking lot yeah I see you on Twitter my go anyway Su proo right like I go to like tournament and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what does it how do you become and this may be a level one question but I'm really interested in it how do you become good at geog guessing is just studying like a normal person about like start watching dubbing cultures is D involved in this bre Breakfast of Champions consume some sort of loving product I mean it's not like something that you can just like start off being good at like no one starts off like even if you've traveled a ton like most people start on Square zero okay so it's like you have to start by just like playing a lot and you have to like read a ton of documents and like watch a ton of YouTube videos and like kind of documents dude where did I even begin I've seen them bro I don't know zipper can you oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I wonder if I can link it just groans he's like it might be bookmarked on his phone so ask him I mean there's like there's like thousand plus page documents on like Nigeria are these Geer specific targeted documents it's only people made from the Geer Community for the Geer community so it's not like Nigerian studies it's it's for the game and it's like mainly like Google car stuff oh my God it's not like even about the landscape it's about like the Google car like the driver like the color of the car like things like that it's like super in the weeds but it's like only to be good at Region guessing Nigeria it's not like when you go to Nigeria you'll be good at recognizing you can recognize like the street view car or like the different coverage of like the seasons and things like that I would say there's some translation but like what like yeah there's a lot that doesn't what what is the translation like as you have traveled around what's a geoguesser develop skill that has has turned into something Valu in real life I'm not doubting that cuz I you're like wait a second feel I'm in La CU I would have I would have guessed it had some real life application but now from the way it's being described I'm like like how does that actually so I mean there's like meta that's like just a camera but you still do learn a lot about the countries so there is like unique polls and like different like things around like different regions of like countries that still are unique but if you want to be at like the people in the world cup competing a lot of what they're relying on is like Google meta like the copyright the season the colorit yeah like what season like wait what did you the copyright like in the background like the the little overlay yeah like the little copyright so like some countries like let's say for example like Russia hasn't been updated for a while so it'll only have 2021 copyright but if you have 2023 copyright it Russia cheese yeah so there's like you're looking at things like that that when you're watching a pro play you're not even thinking about like they're even looking at that yeah I sent you a doc I don't know if it it's just one of them but as an example but I I tried cracking into this recently cuz I've been doing this God gamer challenge I've been watching it's I feel like every time I tune in it's always just geoguesser it bro it geoguesser got so bad that Conor crashed out and we can't play it anymore really it's off the menu he off the it's off the it's it's one of our higher win rate games it's relatively fast but he would rather go to OverWatch which I've played seven games of because he hates it so much cuz what happens is people got good enough at even gold level that they know all the meta information like recent there was like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it was like one of them cars like a like a bike rack on top and I thought it was gone cuz it had a sticker I saw this happen live okay yeah and the other people actually went rayun like how' they get that it was Ray Union a French island outside of Madagascar which I only know cuz my cousin went there and got sick that's CRA I didn't know where it was in the world until these Zog people got it can you just scroll through like the middle click scroll who just as fast as possible it's like here's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] keep going dude look at all these telephone polls is this just a telephone pole document this is like a this is an outdated document but this is like a micro document that shows an example of like telephone poles Google not aif through this different license plates this is like a and this is like a like a crash course document yeah this is this is crazy this is 101 yeah this is 102 102 is like the where's the compass do you think the geoguesser community is better at triangulating a location than the government I would say some people probably like I mean the I don't even know what the government's capable of though to be honest but like I would I would assume they're probably good but like at most time Jus players just like look at like copyright on cars right so it's like there's like a balance of like imagine the the you the the military being like all right all right rainbow go ahead tell us tell us where the Russians are it's like well where's the copyright theop what's the season are we are we like in Winter right now dude one of my favorite Discord memories is dude it was during Co we're all playing G or like 3:00 a.m. and it's somewhere in South America uh I think it was [Laughter] Mexico about it is was it Mexico or Amer it was do you remember saying I'm obviously not helping contribute to this this Cher problem we're all playing we're all playing Cher the same time and uh we we're like clicking through and there was a sign that said Mada lagap and then do you know where that is no he's washed bro and and and I remember we just spent we spent so long looking on Google Maps for the town the small town of model lagap and it was like 40 minutes and Yan this like at 3:00 a.m. Yan pops off in the call he's like dude I found it I found model guap I found model and he's like jumping up and down like he got the golden ticket we find it it was the craziest [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ever and then we found out we geog guessed correctly um and that geog guessed correctly as as like a squad you were in this but you didn't Spike I probably started this trend in our Discord you were yeah you were in the call yeah I've been on that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for a while I confirmed it with him I'm OG this is the oldfashioned way to play that's like the Geo wizard way to play which is like unlimited time scanning over just pouring over a map and trying to find where you're at which is theoretically the lamest to play I think it's it was like I liked watching Geo wizard do it cuz then he would do the fast forward video and he would play his own music which is nice uh but it has phased out because I think doing it yourself it's like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I just want to were you doing something so so I have a friend he he's one of the guys who runs the biggest Smash tournament in the world called Genesis and one of his Hobbies is he likes just getting on Google Google Earth or or Google Maps and just dropping into random locations and scrolling and he's done this for years and he just likes seeing like oh like what type of streets connect this tiny type of tiny City in this country pre geoguesser existence let me tell you this boback would not do this if he didn't have the pen this is not boback it's Sheridan Sheridan yeah he would not do this if he one of those guy he just like loves City skylines and like stuff like that uh were you doing anything like that before like did you just like browse browse maps in your free time not really like if I was ever going to stre it'd be like to check if there's like parking and I was like I wasn't like yeah I was always like curious about like the world and thought the world was sick but do you think that you like it's just so chaotic that you may as well have gotten into something else cuz you're like the the geog guessing guy right yeah people put your picture like as a me with lock it's like a photo of like an anime like like feat or something like finds for like some really really beich por you are locked in face yeah that's that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] insane like your face is so well known yeah it's just for drag of D do you hate that no it's fine you can't be mad that how old are you 25 25 yeah how often are you you getting recognized in like day-to-day life well I live in Thailand yeah so so you don't you don't I feel like most Tha people yes like most Thai people don't really consume like English media it's like mainly in Thai they in is there a good geog guesser from Thailand yeah there is yeah there there's a couple like good YouTubers and players at the local yeah he SE dude that'd be hype the Bangkok local V goggles on [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] actually but I mean if I go to like a tourist era it's like you know one to two bro have you met mood dang who the hell what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you guys kidding me yeah zipper please if you would it's a street fighter player probably a DOTA player prob a DOTA play yeah moodang the baby hippo you dumb bastard so much better is in Thailand yeah this is a a Thailand uh zoo and he's a pigy hippo named mang which I think means pork bun I have to go all the yellow background go up he's the hottest sensation of that is what my actual poops look like he's a hot sensation he's kind of eclipsing Fiona who was the kind of the star child baby hippo from the Ohio zo what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you laughing at we all have our [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm the geoguesser of baby animals that's just crazy this awesome to go uh also in Thailand have you saw the Gibbons there's Gibbon monkeys there they're natives I feel like you've talked about this before are you do you listen to the yard yeah I have what [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] go I'm I'm a patreon no way no way wait is that true yeah you can check my subscription that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hard calculate you're really going to chump check him here yeah someone someone check it yeah thank you well that makes me feel good it's like when uh we found out like tweak and Magi and all these Gamers listening oh my God yeah real Gamers listen to the art Pat Quinn Quinn famously not didn't get a ring this year qu from DOTA Quin from DOTA Quin DOTA Quin DOTA he Lov [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yard and walie and uh that guy who was good at pinball in our Discord you you are you are in the Pantheon of soldiers with that guy who's good at pinball dud he's like he's like number one's great at pinball okay tell me about Thailand cuz you like I I remember it vividly you were like I'm just going to go travel the world now and then you did it and then you travel the world for I don't know where exactly you went and then you're just like yeah I'm going to stay in Thailand now why Thailand yeah so I spent a year just like traveling I had I just had like a portable setup that just bring like a laptop second monitor like my camera whatever and just did videos you were like also like uh like just crashing people's places right like this this where you found the Google car yeah so I had a friend in Germany like other GSR Pros if I ever went to like a new country I would like message friends that lived there and like from the gser community it's cool it's like smash like Melee it's like Community is something you can achieve through video games yeah it's I mean all my friends day to day it's the only people I talk to are there like are there like different like Mains like I main i m Europe yeah yeah there's definitely like Australian Mains Russian Mains people are people are known for like their country that they're good at everyone has a good what's yours I'll take credit for Thailand right now I would consider myself one of the better Thailand players that's cringe why is that CR because you live there yeah but like he also Lear about it Noy man it's also it's not it's probably not the best main to be though it's like lowkey low tier because it's not that big of a country so it's like the point differential that's a fair point yeah also if you see a gibbon you're like that's only in one of two places like if you made Russia you're pretty yeah Russ it's a good Roi I feel like you keep bringing it back you're really focused on the Gibb part can we not talk about the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Gibbons have you seen them he said no no but but they're you're they're right there I guess I haven't gone to Disneyland I live right next to have you seen that that uh that London taxi driver who plays Geer in London yeah Tom I think is his name is cool but he has like the world record in London like he dude he like he like spawns in he's like I know exactly where I am oh for just London cuz he's oh I see tax there like oh this is exactly this the test to become a cab driver there so hard oh really yeah to become a cab driver in London you have to like uh memorize all the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] streets why would you just use navigation uh apparently it's worse it just hasn't caught up it is one of those ancient cities that's why it's built so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] human cuz I think traffic can spawn if you use navigation while you're navigating through the navigation thing I see yeah look you you look at something like uh you look at a city like London and then you look at like Phoenix are Iona and you're like oo they planned this this is a grid now be a cab driver there they let babies be cab drivers there driv is fine it's legal there if yeah you can be drunk in a car a good grit wait so why did you land on Thailand I used like it was my first time ever really leaving America going into like Europe and then I went to Asia and just like fell in love with Bangkok um it's like the it's like the standard like you know everything everyone says I think Anthony Bourdain has a quote where he was like my first time in Asia it was like it was the first moment I realized I was like living my my life in like black and white which is like pretty profoundly like real in my opinion like it resonate with that it's like like everything is new again and like you can start learning and you know start learning Thai and then like start like experiencing new cultures and food it's just like fun for me you're like Aiden I actually realized this before when we met you out there you are like if all of us got crammed into one guy okay what does he have from each of us okay so Aiden his love for other places in the world that aren't the US he said he'd never move back here coming here was a wakeup call you wouldn't want to freaking move back to Jersey and let let someone pump your own damn gas at the Garden State now that you mention it um lwig he has a yearn for for big content in numbers and B days and Tha but hole yeah I think so do they use the hose or do they use the I have like the little button you presses mhm yeah most public places have the hose though yeah the hose I know the hose is Big um skip slime me what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] come on I'm no I'm getting you after you last I just have to think longer about you uh look the B the Burks the baggy pants the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] over the oversized wash shirt are you kidding me is all right so that's me and O and um yeah obssessed with an Asian country for a weird reason this reason so reason normal very normal this reason is geog guesser okay yeah that's turn enough I like Gibbons they look like they have little coats on like how can how can you not yeah yeah we're arguing right now that's not my point it's not weird let me ask you a question rainbow is it pink what Jes I was expecting like a profound question dude Jo what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] well he didn't answer but why are you as a man living in a place called Bangkok true wait why not that's the Beast response if you watched the yard we do occasionally ask a question you don't have to answer M are you cut or uncut uh cut my god well I'm American New Jersey hey two American two Americans two Americans right here you're kind of Canadian and I'm kind of I'm American I had to fight for it you didn't fight for [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] man did you yeah you're nationalized we had to take the I'm nationalized n times naturalized you know I am I don't really know you're six you're 6'2 in white dude that's like the pre-check of American it was rough for me growing up you never knew if you're going to get thrown out wait do you have to pay American taxes yes do you yes why would you just ask two times why cuz we get ours we get ours yeah dud the IRS comes for us all is it worth denouncing if you're never going to move back good question right well You' have to secure your statehood in in Thailand first and then renounce your statehood before the Department of State I feel like it's easy am I crazy to do stth Hood in Thailand versus some other countries some I don't know some countries are are uptight about it have you looked into getting a Thai passport um my Visa gives me like citizenship after like five years yo yeah so that's pretty strong yeah Visa are you on it's called the Tha Elite Visa it's like really weird it's kind of pay to win okay yeah hell yeah but it's not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] go dude I don't know if it's maybe it's five years I actually don't know that that could have been a lot we don't really have pay to win visas here in America right uh for sure it's just way expensive yeah different level of pay to win I think oh there there's not like the the they won't show there's usually a Pay to Win option if you're if you're at a big enough threshold guess what being a Pro Gamer it's you don't you're not you're not tall enough to G new in New Zealand do you know about do you know about that he during Co he moved to New Zealand and just bought citizenship because which is like not a normal thing you can do there but he's just a billionaire and he was just like Liv there for six months and purchased it in his giant Steam Sale bunker um how do you make money so like I was mentioning to someone before I I don't even really post on short form as much anymore like maybe once every like three or four months but I have like the my main channel YouTube second channel YouTube That's daily okay my main channel YouTube is uh like once every week once every other three weeks oh you're just a raw cont I didn't know like and then I have like I actually have this thing called Tha Thailand sounds like an ASMR no one even knows this is me really yo maybe some people but like we have a deal with like Pandora where it's like it's like only we have like a guy that records like like Ty like and it's from Tai just a guy who's like just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mic yeah pretty much yeah and it's uh yes we're like doing like a million streams and like Pandora holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] SI I forgot Pandora was a thing still we're on like the like the biggest uh rain radio there you no no no I won you're laughing you're laughing about rain radio but I I would be remiss if I didn't say that I don't pop on a walking through Soul cloudy day 48 Hours Rain video there's a mark yeah dude and they have millions of views that's why you can't hear me would I yell at you through your headset yeah cuz I'm walking through Soul dud on your way to PC bomb [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what what inspires you to work on a channel like that are you brought into it is it your idea can you find this channel wait is it pandor exclusive no it's on Spotify but just like really succeeded on pandor because they put us in like the biggest playlist oh that's SI so it's kind of like the biggest rain play list yeah wow wait what what part do you what do you contribute to the Rain playay like sounds are you like there going hey how's it going so it's it's it's no it's you would have no idea it's like anything I did okay it's like it's all it's going to sound cringe it's like my favorite placees I've been in Thailand it's like the sounds from those places okay that's cool yeah so it's like my favorite like waterfall or like Market okay like cheating it yeah so like I hire someone with like a professional setup and everything to go just audio or video it's just audio dude and so they just go there and they have like and you're sort of directing them to capture they do it I just tell them where fav place got an idea for you usually worth a million dollars the record shows um raino guesser there that's good you know what I'm saying it's not there used to be an old uh gser plugin where they instead of getting the location it would play their radio and so you would have to guess like what country radio is dude it's like when when whle came out then then hurdle came out and then there'd be like like hurdle for like certain like there's like a tailor Swift hurdle Swift yeah Swift sorry yeah and now there's like 8,000 that lion plays yeah just made Porter Robin Soul or whatever it's called made that Porter Robin Soul yeah it's really hard so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] funny you know Northern lion was like the first ever like video you guys her video uploaded was from northern lion really yeah it's like no don't tell me this BR me like three other Pros like spent like weeks trying to find the first ever video uploaded for like a documentary another jaser play was making there's like one news article like right when it came out and it's like Northern lion really it's like right what year is that I don't even 2013 that's insane he's a menu gamer menu gaming he's just like a legend of G you're pissed you're pissed cuz you called your dumb ass out I'm yeah I'm pissed cuz I started I bought I got a pelaton from my girlfriend and then I started riding the pelaton cuz I don't like running and then I I just I told Chad off hand I was like yeah I've been riding the pelaton and then it gets to Northern lion and he's like you see Ludwig's been riding the pelaton and he got an air fryer this guy wants to be me and I'm like I I don't know I just I'm right I don't even have an air fryer it's funny he didn't even say it that way he's casually playing literally a game where you're sopus rolling a boulder up a hill and he's saying he wants to beat me so bad and then he sent me such helpful messages after on the best pellon classes and now I'm riding to Sam yo 30 minute high intensity you know how it is you should start listening to the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] OG talking about the Thailand rain sounds I think the rain wouldn't I need like I need a British man yelling at me telling me to keep going otherwise I'll fall it is one of my favorite stories about lwi is you know you obviously I'm sure where he's very good at mashing but the a button like for like for no I'm good I'm one one of the best masers in the world like he literally is like he can Mash an a button extremely quick right and you want you hurt by the way you told me Point Crow's good at it oh my God I was just like I don't even care anymore yeah he's so good at it I don't a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] anymore but it's like we were good before they were good you know what I mean we're like the Canon Isaiah this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dude but yeah we were at we were at a party at at the old house a bunch of us used to live in and lwig was there and he he like it dude it's like 2:00 in the morning everyone has just either passed out or just mildly gaming or about to go to sleep he is shirtless with giant headphones on in the middle of the living room just trying to mash as hard as he can on Mario Party alone wait this is real this is no this is real it's not a bit you're like actually really good yes sir well well like so we played Mario Party 4 which is the most competitive Mario party if you didn't know yeah and I wasn't very good and so I was like what what's a skill set I can grow and it was mashing cuz no one was that good and so I i' I like looked up videos and I practiced while people hung out and parted in in Mario Party 4 there's a game called do have you played Mario party I don't think so you a domination on Mario Party 4 there's a game called domination and uh you you have 10 seconds to press the A Button as many times as you can see and uh the game caps you at 160 so if you're able to press at 16 times a second then you hit the game's cap and we found that out when we were really into the game and we were like oh my God we got to try to hit 160 um and L was the first one of us to do it uh and then I was second and then um and then the a modder who mods melee stuff came he uncapped domination so there's a mod where it uncaps and now you can you have 10 seconds to reached out to like the big like one of the biggest modders for Super Smash Brothers like I don't know if this game is like you know Spanish to Italian VI but if you could make this happen that would be awesome and he uncapped it and so we were like oh let's see how much we can actually get and L was like over 200 I was the world record cuz it was first get 2011 in the mod and then the goat came from the Shadows saw my video and then dropped 240 dude never been beaten again I was pretty obsessed with Mario party for a while and I was like grinding like every single game and uh when I saw that silver boxer was like interacting with lwig I was like dude this guy's no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] joke I'm like I was the only person who like knew who that was I was like that guy's no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] joke he's going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cream you dude and he's like nah whatever he drops he rips like what was like 234 or something like 20 20 almost 24 times a second he was goat uh I think what what what is fascinating about you rainbolt in terms of like normies see you and they're like holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this guy's like crazy talented at looking at a picture but like I think with us we we also we are we are brought together initially before the show and before everything by being obsessed about something which was melee like a video game right and like the idea of like being so good at something that you I don't know you get rewarded for it it's kind of the difference between what you getting into geoguesser and maybe any other video game or esport maybe besides like chess is is that like if you if you pop off or become super knowledgeable about like even even something League of Legends super popular right your content around that thing can't really like break through to the masses but because geoguesser is like this idea of just knowing locations on Earth I feel like it's really cool because anybody watching doesn't have to understand like this new game or ort to like find what you're doing really really interesting exactly yeah they don't need to know that fox reflector comes out in a frame um but we what was I going to ask I forgot I was going to ask because the you're you're presumably pouring over these documents to get good at the game at the beginning like you're looking at these types of things right um have you taken like were you doing this with other types of games before like have you ever do dove into something else like that like jaser is like my first real game I kind of sweat are you a gamer uh I play fortnite yo are you nasty no I play Zero builds I'm it's like cringe n PC fortnite okay it's just like fun with my friends or like like golf with friends with like Jus or guys I mean like I'll play like party games right what was like your big hobby growing up um I grew up in very like rural Arkansas like 13 people in my graduating class no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah in high school there was actually a thousand kids at the school it was K through 12 like one building yeah yeah yeah like super like small town Arkansas um I played basketball growing up so like I yeah wait are you nasty I peaked in high school for sure dude there's I have like this one clip of me like hitting like this like last second like half court shot that I just like Lynch onto yes sir but the fade away half court it was like it was a fade away being going for the fade away there you're not getting pressed that hard it was it was yeah but no I definitely picked in high school D I wish you stay longer we could ball yeah get some shots up yeah I I also grew up in a rural area and I feel like it it I don't know I always resented the fact that I grew up in a s such a like a low low traffic place um which is why I like cities now like when I became an adult like for me it was like that's why like I think G is so fun for me because it's like growing up I think in like the small town you kind of you think that that you think that like that's the whole world it's hard for you to see like like my perception of Thailand when I was like 13 14 was probably like you know third world country like super poor like yeah jaser is like a way to to to learn and like you're almost forced out or you're forced in when you're in a small town yeah so do your parents get it do they like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] understand what's going on yeah like with your life yeah okay I think so yeah I talk to my talk to my parents yeah cuz like we all at some point have had to explain to our parents like yeah it's it's called Super Smash Brothers I know it's so I'm about to spend as much time I spent in school on this video game and learn nothing so you good with that I hope so because I'm doing it but like they get it yeah they get it that's cool dude actually giester works really well with parents because I that's what I played when I went back home sometimes like with my mom I put throw on the TV and just go to like a random spot and then like she gets really excited when it looks like France she like that's France and it's it's like Poland I'm like ah close though dude can we talk about the cultural impact of Polish trees dude polish trees at the World Cup was hype I love that what happened this is like a moment when I was playing geoguesser with schlatt where I had like I think picked up may maybe through you like or I forget before my ERA this at some point I had picked up that like trees in Poland look somewhat like birch trees occasionally not even always Poland not even always Birch but they're tall and they look birchy and then and then I'm playing with schlatt and and I'm like I guess and I was like yeah the trees look polish and he freaks out he crashes schlat way he goes the trees look polish lwig and then it was like it was like it turns out it wasn't even polish yeah the guest was like kind of bad I think I might be wrong it's either this or Sri Lanka yeah SRI those trees were not polish yeah no I think it's it's probably the most VI yeah sure when it spawns you in a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Forest that's real great where are you guessing I like that it plays a Taco Bell noise look I don't want to drive and then you find information I fig well I don't know if we're going to find you didn't guess Poland either no I was Beast yeah how how did you know what country it was well okay so often times s like these trees look polish but they're a little more birchy and polish what the tree the trees look polish he said the trees look polish yeah so anyway yeah it just became like a oneliner that I just like rely on the trees look polish sometimes they look polish yeah it's just how it is but yeah I was casting like the final game of the World Cup and it was Poland I was like the trees look polish it was a reference dude it's like a Wombo Combo yo com dude yeah the World Cup finals was really fun to watch I have a question about the the grand finals why was it the American guy guessing so quickly and the French guy guessing taking so much time and when it always came down to it the French guy was usually a little more right like why was he going so fast if he wasn't certain so the French guy Blinky yeah is like notoriously like the best player in the game okay of all time wow if you were to ask anyone n people would say Blinky I think he got second last World Cup won this world cup yeah he's like he's the goat okay but he's so good especially at moving that he knows how to like find the exact location in like 15 seconds no matter where he is and so MK the American knew that and so as soon as you guess it puts the timer on oh so he's giving him less time he's giving him less time so he has 15 seconds so like you instant send to give him less times and then hope that you're hedge interesting that's that's playing the player sound I mean it worked for a couple of games and definitely the more like there was definitely like tournament nerves you could tell CU there was like points where as the grand finals went on it looked like Blinky got nervous and last time hurt him a lot but but he clutched up and the the grand finals was funny too cuz this like the penultimate round uh was in the US and mk's from I think it's like Pittsburgh and the and this the penultimate like round was in Philadelphia Pennsylvania yeah which is like it's like he should get that but he guesses Pittsburgh if he had guessed Philly he would have won so he guess his hometown loses do you think you think they can hear the crowd I like you think they they spawned and everyone went like he was like I'm going Pittsburgh I have an inside story from last year's World Cup where the players could hear the sounds of the crowd and the Canadian guest Canada because the crowd started getting I'm saying dud no it ended up being like Maine but he was like he thought the crowd thinking it was Canada meant like I said or something like was oh so the crowd hears you the commentators say the crowd would know better than that this is a thing in Counterstrike like when two players are approaching a corner in like in M older Majors The Crowd would start going and then they like they back off the the corner like oh there must be a person here and it was really bad thing with DOTA like they wouldn't go for early strats that would be exciting because the crowd would just give it away yeah if you're trying to like if you're trying to like Ro early or something yeah they just now they Jer gave them like headphones to like blast their own playlist and they have like Mega noise cancelling over that but on the rain sounds baby I'm just I'm just ripping the Colombian license plate yellow it's a long like a 45 minutes song well it's a big issue for chess it's why like chess games are like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] silent yeah cuz we wanted to do a chess game one time and it was like planned to have this like Arena game with two really good players and they were like okay we need to be in a soundproof glass boss we were talking about yeah the how the idea of Spectators seemed so appealing but the the layers of friction to get anybody to agree with that were just so high but there's always that one viral chess moment it was like the it's like two guys from like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Princeton or Harvard or some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and they're playing chess and then there's like a mate line and everyone starts popping off like zoo animals and then he gets it and then he just like stands up to him I wanted that but turns out you can't really get that without kind of cheating Loki yeah you obviously had to compromise something I remember for chess boxing you yourself was like yeah I put those headphones on cuz you did slap boxing with Conor and it's like it just wasn't H everything yeah yeah I could easily cheat but I didn't lost honorably well I lost if I cheated I did a bad fck you're literally the guy who throws for Content that's all I'm saying I've never done that did you ever watch lwig live or is it mostly YouTube like before before the the moment the the moment in your life that changed everything which was seeing him play geoguesser I had an actual like Mega fan in my old like co-working space of lwig and he would always watch you at lunch yeah so I I yeah where' you work um so I worked at like a publishing company that so I made Snapchat shows for like this is why you're the same I forgot that part he came to LA to work at Snapchat yeah well it was like a publisher on Snapchat yeah so I made like those I worked at snap too you were doing the translation stuff right yeah technically I was a contractor so never got the actual snap employment but I but po what was the guy's name uh Trey shout out Trey Trey [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bro he's not watching he's not here anymore but he was Tre we used to be something we used to be somebody become a member by the way now if you haven't from twitch on YouTube a member please TR the fall off was so hard try I play league on that yeah League members only League streams are popping off paying to watch me play league imagine that one day I'm not playing GE I'm playing league and rainbows at Worlds that's what I I I keep wondering it's like we're just so we're just products of chaos it could for any of us it could have been anything what where does rainbolt come from you probably answered that before but that's my last name no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] way [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Li that's got to be you're lying [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you are lying to us you can Google my name it shows up Native American I think it's German okay is it your last name but it's spelled not the way you it's the exact same spelling what we're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with bro that's like having a last name fire truck dude the fastest guy of all time was named y Zan bolt that is crazy his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] name that's a stage name no that's got to be it's just his name look at be saying Bol saying I don't buy that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for a moment are you related to you saying Bol it's not even the same name I would I would bet my odds on dud St Leo Bolt isn't that sick no no don't go to Z go to Wikipedia Wikipedia would never lie to me oh zipper just Zooms in we're we we've been missing so much okay yeah damn wow yeah that's what I'm saying that's so sick crazy to have the last name bolt maybe he was just like young and he's like I should get fast that was dude that's was one of my favorite tweets I've ever made I was just like it's crazy you and you like rain is this like a thing yeah I mean prous you know what I'm saying you came around the other you're living up to it and I like to guess faster than you guesser do you do you like you're saying like you're posting like short form less like i' I've seen your your main YouTube channel what what are like the flag that like oh I need to dive into some other form of content now like switch it up stop doing like geog guesser stuff or you just kind of kind of send it until it stops until it stops working like how do you know when to make a change if any yeah I mean I don't really think too much about like like I jaser will be Evergreen I think for a while like I can always upload like a jaser video and probably have like some of a core audience I expanded like my main channel into like different like ENT it's like open source intelligence or like finding things outside G or like yeah that stuff finding like people's like past photos yeah but yeah that shit's tight yeah it's fun you know like another story you started that what you don't remember this no you like my whole content bucket of finding things for people started because of you too because of the Japanese Japanese too couple I had never even thought about that until you sent that to me someone dm' me it was like a really sweet message and it was like hey uh I got married and it was this place in Japan we have this picture but we want to revisit it and we don't remember where we went and I was like I the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you ask me for I don't know [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so I just sent it to Trevor and I was like hey man uh these people want to find it and then he tweeted it out and it went Mega viral I remember it was funny too cuz he was like at lwig and it's not me it's like the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] guy the software engineer I've been trying to buy that account from for years uh but I didn't know that was the first one yeah that was the first one I never even thought about it that's such a lwig thing to have done which is like yeah he [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] likes you guess she'll probably find it like there's no track record yeah that's my my nephew knows computers he can build your website uh I do think that do you think that most of the people who watch you are people who don't even play geog guesser that would be my guess I would assume so that probably gives you even more longevity I think it's dabblers but once you get it it gets really lowkey unfun past I think gold cuz then it's just meta information yeah like for me I don't play you guys anymore no I really don't like I I have my daily second Channel but I play three games a day like that's it and it's only for YouTube like I still have like love the games that's what the daily upload is yeah it's like just three games a day it's very similar to chess in the in the sense that given infinite time chess is a very boring game that you can just solve and always play The Right Move uh which I think geoguesser is probably somewhat similar in that regard soled so when you make it faster and you give them less time it's more exciting and to like push the human limit of like what you can do in only 10 seconds is more interesting dude you're just you're getting bored of your wife that's so sad me like I still you do crazy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in the bedroom how much melee do you play dude that's true like okay so I don't play gser but I spend all like six hours a days on maps wait wait wa I don't play melee but I spend 20 hours a day with little dolls that I make fight and I think about who's winning what do you mean Maps so like there's a website made by gser player where you can basically just like coverage check which is um which is basically like just clicking and looking at street view and you can like Mark different things that you find so like right now I'm learning Thailand so like I just go through and look at like pretty much every road like Main Road and take notes you you can notice stuff in Market yeah wow so you're trying to is that this is not to travel this is to become a tie like the best tie player in the world and inherently I find cool places in Thailand I want to go to so it's it's like I use it as like a travel guide and then like a way to learn Thailand okay oh my God you could become addicted to this yeah so it's like you're like labeling like oh this is found here and I found this here like these planets are here and then you just like have a map that you kind of generate okay slime I need an update yeah what's up so have you tried putting a factor meal in the microwave yet shut up shut up I just think that shut up I just think that I'm on my grandparents didn't come here D D no prep No Mess fast and easy why would why would you even it's even faster if you don't heat it up for 2 minutes you're correct but it's already fast even with the regular prep time yeah I live A busy life I'm a day trader you guys don't know that about me that's what I've been doing this whole time it's Factor man here to tell you that if you guys at home want to save money and save time and sa trouble and if you're a day trader specifically you can get Factor meals which are fresh Chef prepared meals deliver straight to your door and to be clear you put them in the microwave for 2 minutes it's time you genuinely don't have to if you need to you could be fueling your trades with the keto calorie smart vegan and veggie Protein Plus meals you could do vegan if you're dating someone who's vegan and you want to lar for a week oh before you inevitably go back to the real you'll go back you'll go back for sure but for a week if you want to fake it you can I we we've kind of rode this bit out it's not a bit I do eat these I get so many in the mail I eat them regularly 35 Plus meal choices you could have a different meal every single day for a whole month and I knows it's not a bit I just want to make it clear that like if if anything I'm about this life he's about this you don't need to be about that part of it but you could be about trying the meals that feature these premium ingredients and Y if you want

cold Factor meals if you're doing the math with your code yard 50 you get 50% off and then 20% off your next box you get 70% off and uh uh rainbow is it true that you gave Kendrick Drake's address so probably I've gotten like my so there's like two in the main jser map mhm it's like a handpicked map so someone went through and like picked every single location oh really yeah so if you want to play like a J map like most people probably start start off with like the world map mhm which is like kind of NPC if you're like at a high level it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ass it's so EUR Centric it's so South America it's either like Paris London or like random City us is it literally just the the mathematical odds of like where the most locations are or how is that a dude picked it oh it's it's curated it's selected so the world map is like generated and mainly giving you like things that it wants people to see like oh this looks like familiar with like Italy oh okay but like the handpick map is like it has like a good distribution of like every country yeah and like you don't get like put in like they got rid of diverse world what happened to that wait they got rid of a diverse World want I do want the diverse world so background it's like geog guesser comes out and the world map's boring because it gives you like the same old boring locations so there's a custom map you can create custom maps diverse World becomes the most popular and kind of the standard for playing uh for like from Geo wizard era e i Geo wizard huh uh Dei Geo wizard I've seen everything yeah woke has taken a grip on it uh but then antiw came in and they got rid of the Dei initiatives the diverse world uh I don't know why what's the lore why they get rid of it so the map maker um deleted it out of like protest for jesser oh why Wow what was his beef he doesn't like that they made it you have to pay to play and he doesn't like avatars okay I think the Avatar thing is fair cuz their arms are weirdly long this guy is incredibly bass look up avatars they look weird when did this get implemented maybe three four years ago okay cuz when I like like two maybe like a year two two years ago years ago probably also the price of the brick went up right like it cost it was like $3 a month right and now it's how much well there was a lot of arrest in Colombia but yeah was there Legacy these are the avatars look how long the arms arear in game they're like Gibbons they they look like squid arm so he didn't like these and deleted the map that's well I think probably more the prr but yeah in like in the grand scheme things he just didn't like their new business model with like having to have to like pay to like have cool drip or like look I will Echo that I think one super valuable aspect of geoguesser is learning the world and especially in America where our geography knowledge is dog [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it is very fun if you are teacher to be able to play this along with students but I don't believe at least when I checked last time they have like a teacher pricing to be able to like have a bunch of student accounts so I was telling my mom because she's a teacher she's a French teacher like you could just handpick or use like one of the French speaking maps and show how many countries speak French she can't do that unless every student signs up for geoguesser and then also you know they if they use their whatever three free games you can make like a challenge link but yeah it's it's like not very user friendly it's not very user friendly and I'm like they should just make a way it's like a like a cheaper subscription for teachers to like get students in because that's like that's insane it's like one of his main values paying for Geer has been around a long time though right like for an account like I feel like I I paid for my account in like 2020 or something yeah I mean it's always been like like a toxic like way to like like you could either pay or you could play or you could play for five minutes at a time yeah it's like but no one's like it's like hostile yeah yeah dude it's like when Yan will he he doesn't pay for the New York Times crossword he just uses the copy website M uh oh he also scrapes yeah yeah he has a Chrome extension that'll scrape the New York Times refuses Yan is not a poor person he just hates the people of New York he hates it but he loves the cross word he's a fox guy but he loves the cross word like they like yeah so the equivalent here is you open up geoguesser you see it then you go to Google Maps yeah you just play along where was that yeah uh yeah that makes sense I get that I mean look I I was having a fit I crashed out on stream cuz I saw they sponsored all these people to watch the World Cup bro I was going to say but where's your ad money on that I don't get no damn ad you know I filmed an ad for the World Cup too oh with the handshake that's just a fumble you probably would have been one of the bigger streams if not biggest uh no I think it's actually tell hey come on tell I played 15 hours of geoguesser in the week that the World Cup happened for free they have me by the in front of 20K people by the ball tell tell the CL why they didn't select you I might have said this is the most dog [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] game to have ever been made I'm going to kill myself in front of all you guys in real life with a gun I'm going to change the course of your lives this game's so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ass I can't believe people play this even rainbow should stop playing and maybe end his life too maybe I said that maybe I said that what what kind of country do we live in if we can't say that and that's what I'm saying it's not fre anymore well you got to guess which I can't blame you I heard it also might have been a twitch Bounty but I can't confirm because I'm not on Twitch so I'm not sure well I think what they did jiger is an interesting company I'll say that like the people employees very nice but I think what they did is they went to like solome and it's like sorted by like Jer and then it's like on Twitch only and who's played it and that's like only how they found that they kind went through and like check check their box like you can stream on damn YouTube now yeah exactly a son of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] send us your best mes send us your mes they got H working at so like to get the info for that it cost a lot for like the YouTube one cuz I bought it it's stream charts that's like the website that tweets out like top YouTube streamer of the week and then recently they tweeted out it's like top 10 YouTube streamers and it's like like American ones and it's like I show speed Dr disrespect No Tag he just wrote his name out lwig and I'm like he's won this week uh but I I paid for one time to see like basically what you get from sulome but for YouTube is 500 a month what that's actually that's Ste for the YouTube sets it's very Steep and if you want to add kick it's like 300 but you get like a two for one deal so it's 10% off Jesus I ended up paying like $1,500 for the info I needed for just that month wow yeah what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is that useful uh for the Mogul mail yeah like it was it would it gave it I made it back yeah and I had more information than I would have had which I mean for like their business model their business model is targeted at like an agency who would normally have a contract with a major brand like a geoguesser and so for them yeah but they yeah they don't have a huge clientele they're not being used like solome is all right hypothetical geoguesser is outlawed from the world ilal we've realized that it's it it globalization shut down borders have closed people start calling Polish people trees and we have to go back and delete the web becomes a bad word what do you do with your life now I feel like I've disconnected myself enough from G keep you could keep doing YouTube yeah I could still I still have like my main channel YouTube doesn't upload gester really at all okay and then if like I'm banned from that like I'll start a farm in Thailand and like he's going to the the rain spots you've never seen in countries you never heard of I'm putting rain in Thailand in places that doesn't have that don't have rain I'm going to create clouds Pandora is just all rain at the end of it do you uh do you want to do like travel content like Anthony Bourdain is that like I mean yeah he's a like I'm just so cringe in front of a camera I hate being like the guy that's like pulling a camera in like people's faces I like I can't do that it's like super hard for me should I get I would love that jet lag bro that would be sick yeah but yeah it's it's hard I'm too awkward in public I don't think that matters like I think as long as you are I mean I guess the issue is always the filming part but if you get someone to film for you it'll help especially someone you know cuz you can have like a natural rapport with them yeah is there like a area of cuz obviously you know a lot of people from this like from the geog guesser community and people making videos about that but have you branched out and like made connections with this like broader spectrum of travel YouTube like do you know a bunch of travel YouTubers and vloggers now or is that not really your your scene at all I kind of stick to my my Lane in jig sir okay I have a collab for you uhhuh I show speed dude oh my God we did a video together what yeah we did stream together when two months ago you're a fake [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fan and I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] always [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what you do an experience for sure an experience we got rainbolt what I mean that's exactly what yeah I told him to go to Tasmania he guesses Tanzania and he's like he told me T honest mistake honest mistake that is an honest I mean yeah it was definitely you got a lot of Clips out of it yeah is there enough is there enough country because there's a bunch of countries that aren't accessible right that have like no street view data at all so could you you presumably if we magically had photos of all these places you could make a you could make a map of all the places that are not in geoguesser like I'm guessing something like Eritrea okay you're not getting dropped into you have all of these locations that none of the players have ever seen including yourself who has the best Raw Instinct of any player to hit hit the countries correctly because like no every player is like very anti that that'd be like photospheres then who has the best Instinct of any player who's the mango I mean you have to give it to the guy that won the World Cup give it to Blinky bro you have to give it to Blink it's an easy answer but he's just probably the most knowledgeable there's like players that do like more unofficial coverage there's a cian player called alok that really likes different unique places oh he plays Yoshi yeah it's like the plane it knows where it is by knowing where it's not so Blinky can rule out every country it's not he'd be said no sativa come on man it's about the notes you don't play actually though uh yeah I I uh I realize I will I I will not make the leap to getting good you just realized that you think you you're realizing right now you don't have what it takes I I'm I think I'm at my Peak currently right now it's just relative to everyone else it is so much lower cuz my got good yeah I like I used to be way worse but relatively way better than everyone else but nowadays it's just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bro casuals are so good they're so good for no reason and I think the the that dock information to shove that in my brain is just it's too much yeah it's quite you have to it's a commitment it is yeah it is a commitment I had like an opposite moment as melee when I I used to play Geer a lot uh because I thought I was really good at it and when when like GE I saw Geo Wizard and I started to see like YouTubers playing I was like oh I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] at it and I was like I don't want to play this anymore with Mele I was like this is my journey I will go on that's fair oh I had a I had a theory cuz you did a Red Bull shoot where you SC Sky do scov SC from a plane and then geog guest on your way down yep did that idea start with the sentence that I've heard 500 times what if we did geog guer in real life probably okay cuz I feel like that is an idea I've heard so many time I think Red Bull is also pitch up to me they're like yeah we drop you out of a plane because I thought I thought what the idea started with is they drop you out of a plane you don't know where you are and you have to guess before you hit the ground or you don't pull the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that would be pry based it's like you're wrong you're like ah can't pull it yeah I was supposed to do a video this is probably leaking but I guess it's fine a year ago now okay but I was supposed to do a video with Mr Beast oh really was like guess like a short form like YouTube short uhhuh I'm just like guessing like takes me somewhere blindfolded yeah almost like almost happened but fell through unfortunately how did it fall through because in order for me to like go to the place that they want me to I would have had to get like tons of vaccines stuff and that would have given me info to where I was going so we didn't think it was fair like if you have to get like a yellow fever vaccine or something you're like they just give you like 20 vaccines and then they bring you to like Ohio Mr Beast why do you give me 20 vaccines to put me in a box in your back want to see the results on this man you could have just said you were joining the military think he's guessing where he's going he's actually taking 20 different drugs this is so to be clear it wasn't you refusing the idea of taking vaccines you an he's like what am iing okay look to be fair I might refuse 20 that's a lot in one moment no they all take care of each other I see Mr Beast should make a covid vaccine like it should be like Mna yo it's got chocolate and and that it's Beast you take the Beast marker of the Beast mark of the beast that's what we call for kids only for kids only only kids you got to be a kid only comes with every lunch leag there's a syringe in the febles bar and then you pull it from the Prime energy it got the plastic has like a long section yeah no this these are all workable ideas if you want to take them you can I do that to get back prime or vaccine it's either Prime in there or it's a vaccine would you be good at that like being dropped in a random spot cuz presumably he was going to put you in a place that wasn't on Google Maps so I made sure that like it was like it would have been like a Street viw coverage I see a list of all their wa let me take over this idea yeah we'll fly you to a random place in the world I like when Gio wizard would do it cuz he just goes somewhere in England where I his partner would drive him somewhere in UK and then he'd be walking around and and then he would just be looking at a map the lady would be like he'd be like where am I and she'd be like I remember this one clip she's like I don't know I've ended up here just like this dude how would you get every like top geoguesser Pro and you blindfold send them to a different country and they got to figure out where they are I think like like jet lag kind of we steal jet it's like a thing we steal we steal jet we J I mean basically it makes sense for a short because ultimately it is like you you spend about probably a day of your life traveling MH you are blindfolded the whole time and you have to be guided like a like a child Y and then you have to guess presum in like you know an hour and then it's off to the next location you have to do it a few times damn that's a whole lot of work holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm just realizing how much money that all is oh yeah I mean he asked me like or like his team was like are you like comfortable with like helicopters and like oh I'm like in boats I'm like oh my God like this is like yeah yeah so you always say no to the helicop they got K they not getting me no I haven't I'm doing a helicop my first helicopter in like two weeks though where at uh base camp Everest oh yeah you're doing a little Everest base camp Everest that's that's I mean that's a little Everest wants to be very clear still high that's still lowkey a little hard to get to yeah wait you're flying up to it so you climb up and then fly down oh okay okay I was like isn't it bad if you fly straight up yeah it's like cheating okay no I don't even mean like Integrity wise I mean like you you don't you need time toate oh yeah probably can a helicopter just get to the top of Everest no no cuz the air is too thin really yeah so it can't fly that high anymore what is that why it's so cool that we do it yeah CU we're not supposed to a plane can get up there right uh yeah different mechanisms make them fly ask question don't let them bully you but a PL but if a helicopter can and a plane can't they're both flying vehicles helicopter grabs the air and lifts it so how high is the roof but but a plane goes this way can get a running start it's a running start so a plane gets air because air goes underneath it but how is that air not too thin but the but the chop chop chop chop chop ch ch you can still fly in a horizontal way if if there's no atmosphere you thought Mexico was in South America so you stop talking you talking today right now I'm right someone's just got a comment correct all of us we can get past this it's going to be great I just like educating my friend who can you paramotor can you paramotor to Everest why using the same mechanism of I think yeah cuz it's not moving as fast would you param don't don't answer this over the the pyramids that' be cool oh well it would be cool wouldn't it no him would be cool this is lowkey how slime says he wants to murder people is by asking them to paraglide with him over the param excuse me over the pyramids but without him and he'll watch because there are many many param moting a motoring accidents uhuh yeah man like all these content creators they bring lwig on their show they make fun of him and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and be like let's get on a paramotor bro but this one get on [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] param dude I'd go with you and we'd be our together you do you think you'll be buried in the sarcophagus rainbolt do they have those in I know what that is the sarcophagus is what the Pharaohs used to be buried in ah in the jewry it's weird that he doesn't think he'll be in one normal C we are going to be in one so get used to it all right yeah did you can join ours if you in your high school was there like a was the coolest kid there had a big ass there's 13 people yeah it's like exhaust yeah you can only budget one cool kid and at school that time that's cool Tyler but in rural Arkansas he has the truck and 13 people it's like it's not even clicks it's just like the one guy is like the theater guy yeah he's the whole department he's got to do a couple things he's the theater guy and also the nerd guy what guy were you guy um sport sporty guy I was on the basketball team but like I was like the whole school basketball it was like sophomore through seniors so one from each year there's like 11 of us okay that is crazy that's like half the school impressive had to be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah there's no TR there's no try out was your was your hangout spot where I grew up the Hangout spot was a gas station ironically enough it was the Sonic no way Sonic Drive-In Sonic does a Sonic does a lot of work for small towns mine was Dunkin Donuts I took my pants off once they kicked me out he always brings it back to mine was movie theater and they shut it down last year mango was a movie theater and he told me where he got a hand job [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] go dude sitting in the seat you wait you were in his the seat that he had hand I was in the girl seat so it wasn't weird I wasn't J off was yeah wait that right okay I'm in a hard worker seat does that makeing it's a hardworking woman I respect her yeah maybe maybe maybe we do this IRL geog guesser that'd be interesting have you thought of doing it yourself I did do it oh how how did how did that I was with a friend in Germany and he took me to Belgium and would like it was like a three-hour Drive blindfold was blindfold but like in your head you're like okay well this is like a 2hour drive you know like you can't you have to like really got there and you were like yeah and he brought me into the German speaking part of Belgium which is like one city or like one very CL so I was like so confused did you get it I end up getting it okay but that's what happened when you're when you capture someone to interrogate them what you have to do is I'm talking why why are you a guy who knows this well you have to capture them and you have to drive around a bunch to make them to make their sense cuz when you arrive at the interrogation place to interrogate the answers out of them and you have to drive around so they don't know like kind of they're mixed up to where how far they've been driven but it could very much be a mile down the road yeah you don't understand what I'm saying they could still be at their own house they can still be on their own damn house where you captured them from where you captured them from and took them that's if you ever do a g is there is there a is there geoguesser uh coverage in Christiania are you probably oh Christiania the it's like this little uh part of Copenhagen that identifies itself as its own like sovereign country and it's where you can like buy uh buy mainly weed I know you're talking about are there roads there I don't think can you drive through it it's like walking street right no it's all walking and biking yeah I don't know if there's tracker there yeah wait there are there are roads there's um there's cars like parked in front of houses I guess that's probably how they like deliver stuff to the stores and things like that if I see a Google van going down my street I'm flipping it over I'm part of a sovereign state oh I flipped that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] car not even I turn that car into swiss cheese let that thing talk yeah I'm let it talk you know he's a dangerous job Google driver the van driver no the car big ass [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Google car and you're just going to like Damascus and you're just like okay just so fun no take it I would I think it would be fun to do like just you in the road and just all you have to do is drive on a road you haven't driven on before yeah I thought these were have you guys been seeing Whos in La yeah at all you I thought you I guess you can say I can't say that why can't say why what I've been yeah la has a lot every time I see one I I give it a little face or something I'm like maybe what is a way I pulled up it's just a it's a self-driving car that's in La now at least in like West LA but it has a spinning thing on the top a spinning thing on the top and I just assumed it was like a Google Street View thing and I pulled up beside it and then there was no guy in the car and I just did a double take you know cuz I didn't realize that those were like outside of sa Francisco uh it'd be fun to just get in it like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what are you do people do [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with them they just put like a cone in front of it and then it's done they soft yeah it's like tipping over a cow it's like that he's done for the rest of the week it's like walking a horse upstairs what do you think is he knows what I'm talking about that when you when you gave that Anthony bouran quote about uh you know living living in asah what is what is something that day-to- day that's like really really changed for you like it seems deeper than just like I get this is this is nice it's like a different perspective on life what do you think that is you know the biggest thing is is I've become so anti-car over the past like like two years that just getting on the train and just like being able to walk everywhere so nice it's the best thing we [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this country up so goddamn bad bro [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] beautiful and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we're awesome I I drive a k truck on the wrong side of the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] road no license plate that's one of the greatest [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't know why you're on the wrong side I drive a vesa and I get hit by a damn car I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] love every second of it I get up I shake the hand of the guy who hit me thank you I think it comes down to this country is just not like it it would never be feasible to not have a car way we have one of the largest countries on Earth it's not about being large it's about living in a city that like we we have just designed the whole place we we built one walkable City and then never again it's just bad it's bad Planet I don't Boston's walkable [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Chicago Chicago New York San Francisco there's a lot La is not one of them I guess I'm talking about the the like the subway infrastructure sure for like New York like that is like a giant place with 8 billion 8 million people uhhuh that is good to go and then other other places are like Shadows of that I don't know man is the public transport really good in Thailand I don't know how yeah it's awesome they have a sky train that goes like through an entire they have a Sky Train yeah it's called the BTS see how [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] far behind we are is Thailand Rich what's Thailand looking like these days yeah I mean it's yeah has a lot of money like you have gambling is there cin I don't know if I actually don't know is it religious Buddhism Buddhism okay not it's not very because like Malaysia is incredibly like Muslim right mhm is what's like the big illegal thing there that you can do that you can do here isn't there like what are the laws on drug one where you can kill a cow right shoot RPG at a cow drug laws in Thailand the drug laws yeah uh they just legalized weed they legalized it okay it sounds lit wait it's incredibly Progressive for the region no cuz like Indonesia and Malaysia are like yeah I mean yeah they have tons of like Pride rights too so like lgbtq in Thailand yeah this is like to like totally opposite of their neighbor no uh like Malaysia and Indonesia yeah I I just know that Thailand's like super like cuz I'm pretty sure those are those are incredibly Islamic countries and I know Indonesia is drinking is not I think something that is like chill all right I have a question you have a you're you have an RPG you know like from video games you can shoot it at the bare ground you can shoot it at a chicken or you can shoot it at a cow what do you shoot it at you have to you have to your whole family is going to go away from if you shoot at the ground it could cause an earthquake that kills thousands go ahead that's not true or you do a cool jump it's just the ground what's like the life of the cow it's like an it's not a baby cow has it lived a good life no cow I think has lived a good life that's a lot just no the Japanese ones and Mark Zuckerberg's it's it's grass it's grass-fed but the plan was to kill it Mark Zuckerberg's cows are doing so good right now I I'll shoot the ground you shoot the ground I'll take the earthquake wow in uh in Cambodia if you got 20 bands lying around it's not even it's not even that much you kidding me how much is it maybe 20 bands Cambodian it's not a lot it's like a couple hundred dollar cou there's no a couple hundred dollars it shooting RPG has to cost more than that is that eating his own cow with a big [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cheesy crit C he looks like he has a a face hugger on his penis under the table why does he look like that Dam what a big ass piece of me do you think he shot the cow in the head in front of his kids teach him a lesson about life he took him down Brazilian jiu-jitsu style he broke his neck that's why he's been getting buffed to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] physically disable his cow he says if you win this fight you get to walk dude uh yeah in Cambodia you can shoot a cow with an RPG it's like a real that's touristy thing I suppose on on your K so if a Google car you know is driving by Cambodia plan that a Google car image scrolling around and there's like a RPG fly across a field you go up the street a little more the frame of the cow you go back and forth it's just a cow alive and not alive oh my god dude that's awesome that is awesome yeah I've been trying to get on uh Google Maps I've been same I've been making little faces at the cars I go by them and I write down on my phone where I was and that's cool oh you're into it you want you want to be famous see one I'm like I'm like you see nothing planed for when it actually arrives uh no of course no I don't have like a sign or anything my first day in Germany yeah walk out getting donor with like a German friend it's like Bob and we walk out the Google C is right there and it's like recording oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] my first day out of the US how do you know it's recording um well we didn't at the time okay okay but it end up getting published and this was at the point when Germany was just blury where was just Gen 2 coverage yeah so they hadn't ever they would drive the cars blury but they wouldn't publish it they were just using it for data oh okay and so like two years went by and they finally published like my face oh you were oh you were actually in yeah we chased the car video of running like you just keep clicking through there just this guy just like oh so that I I cuz I know you tweeted that a while ago but they didn't have it on Google Maps so recently yeah they just uploaded it like last year wait that's sick and so yeah and it's actually in the biggest that that location was put in the biggest jser map so you can actually get me in jser a few be that's cute okay give me your top three best and worst places you've been to top three best as a well-traveled man yes okay uh just like overall best okay Thailand La T okay back to back Thailand and La you're just straight up living in the spot you think is one of the best places to go and then also like like like a 2hour drive right like L is so close snow uh yeah it's like it's like a 10hour drive from a bus from 10 10 on the maper they're like so close to each other you just have to go through Cambodia right uh no he thinks he's so nice no you can take a flight and but it's directly bordering Thailand on the northern border so you could go um it's like an hourlong flight from Bangkok to to Vian um yeah so L and Thailand probably top two I no AR hour long flight 10 hour drive they mountain range that is up I mean think about Vegas Vegas is like an hour flight and a three and a half hour drive CU we got we got the good old Interstate straight shot there's just no high bus slower yeah I don't know maybe it like this is americ moment this is an American moment it's just the scale is so much different yeah say it's also a very American thought process that we have that the rest of the world doesn't share where we look at distance on time to cover it as opposed to like actual distance in miles or kilometers uh and I think it's cuz we just are so used to car car time very little very little obstacles uh third third best third best um I'll leave Asia let's see I really liked London actually London really you like London that's my hot take that's my hot take heans and I that is a hot I think London's fun I like it I like it too but most of it sucks I like Ramen I like sushi and then I like just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] beans I guess [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] poop yeah poop like little shitty poop beans let not poop come on I like eating poop and like poop that from a person poop dude future own's poop in this context I look I I didn't mind our time in London but I'm surprised in the top three but well it's kind of just like yeah it was like engagement bait but

wants to go you with you you want to go to you also want to go to Damas what I want to do they got that bridge there we have been talking about going to Damascus but the timing on the trip we were originally planning this trip me and slime were trying to make a trip uh through parts of the Middle East that we were going to end in Damascus and we were like I was looking into like how you get visas to go there and like what it was actually like uh and then the the loose dates for the trip were like March to April of uh 20 I want to say 2020 or 2021 I I forget which year but like covid wasn't over yet and traveling wasn't chill yet and then it is just like become this thing that it's a little more crazy now what's going on right now something happen give me give me up to speed go for Ludwick is it crazier now no I I uh I have the same issue cuz me and Michael want to do the Japan trip on motorcycle to be Damascus and Japan not the same yeah I feel like they're going through different getting there I'm getting there different our follow-up trip is the Silk Road which famously starts or ends depending which way you're going in Damascus and ends in or starts in China uh like like Shanghai which is it's a very long road and very treacherous and you need a lot of fixers but uh fixers what is that like someone from the area oh yeah to navigate you through safely yeah who has like a big like AK-47 on their back uh usually not weaponized like a big machete maybe that would be more like a bodyguard I do enjoy those there's a few uh good YouTube videos of people biking that trip like basically making their way like across the all of yeah they bike the whole thing that's months yeah yeah it's like a usually the video takes them like a year to make and they travel across they bike across all of China through like Central Asia back across Europe I think the first guy I watched he was like British and then I watched another guy who was Dutch and they go they bike all the way home going across China is hard enough as is but if we're going to do what have to do is soon CU they're going to shut off American imagine going back like a thousand years being
