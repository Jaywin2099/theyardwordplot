once talked about Jill Biden uh and say don't say we it was you what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the people have talked about joot many people have talked about Jo the way that he did it that matters the way was it more sensitive I was talking about whether or not Joe makes her squirt you remember this the silence there was tough is this like that's my time guys thank you so much and uh and some for some reason you said this in what context I was talking about Joe Biden's breathtaking [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so you in your Discord no yeah in in the yard Discord you just do you're just the same as me you just take whatever slime says on here whatever filth comes out of his mouth and spin it around it back he didn't even say Joe Biden's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he talking about he was talking about Bernie Sanders Brett taken [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you're just mixing up [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me that yeah and that was that was Nick's bit I was talking about J B squirting he was talking about Bernie Sanders breath taking [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he was talking about the child P all the pieces and she's built a home in Minecraft with it all it's it's it's beautiful it's incredible she's made it her own would you say that we made you the amount of people that have made me don't even cuz I can't I can't even look at you cuz you know the first time like my inspiration for streaming lwig is involved in that no but what's crazy is it was a podcast that he was on where he was talking about like his dreams and aspirations and I was like wow I really want to be recognized by Devon Nash like that it wasn't even it wasn't even him that inspired me it was Deon Nash like this the go you get Deon Nash's attention I could too that's what I wanted funny dude you can just tweet at him and get his attention no it's not I mean like no I'm saying at any point you're life like this is not he he responds it's not like a rare commodity here this is like this is like when I went to New York for a wedding a few weeks ago and slasher messaged me because he saw I was going to be in New York and he was like hey you want to hang out at this event and I was like yeah it'd be nice to it'd be nice to meet you but then above that DM is two DMS from me in 2017 and 2019 that he never responded to nothing worse what were you asking about oh just like a question about quake and then another thing and then another thing about like twitch emote Revenue that he had been talking about and he just ignored you and then and then now and now look at oh now you want to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] now you want to hang out isn't he the guy that did the doctor disrespect tweet is that guy why were you not asking those questions I feel like those are the better questions7 he Esports who I wouldn't care he's he's an esport sler Esports journalist I do not know who slashers at all I've only ever known him from the doctor disrespect tweet what did you know Devon Nash from that that was like uh he made a video one time called how to be a successful streamer that I watched and I was like that's cool I so you you like typed that into Google that's like his girlfriend typing in cool shoes yeah that's do that looking for shoes uh yeah I Ted that in YouTube and at the time he had like you know 1K viewers he would like talk to you for like uh like all this like Twitch streaming advice and I was like oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah this is the meta you ever accidentally typed the word YouTube into the YouTube search bar instead of the Google search bar and then get the Cur the cursed homepage my God is awesome never can you open the picture I sent you sorry the we have pictures sometimes you do picture time Lally irrel no we can't get anything around her dude she's seen every episode she's not seen the most recent ones I will say it feels weird to be in this setting feels like you're in like the Full House house yeah like I just listening to you guys talk from when I was sitting up there feels like watching an episode yeah well well have you can I can I ask you this do you have a favorite yard member I'm not gonna lie slime it's not you the F I'm sorry but the reason why is because you actually just scare the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of me why what am I scary about scary I told how am I scary I have new evidence in the case against slime but please continue yeah you're you're now that I've met you you're actually very sweet you're like a sweet guy I know my favorites oh no keep going the C going keep going my favorite totally relevant to you L you're waiting for it to be you isn't it no I no one ever picks me cuz it's like picking Mario I get it I get it's like picking [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Mario that's the most self-aware thing you've ever said Mario [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Strikers and no one wants to pick [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Mario ifame to pick Mario but the game would not exist if it was IPL Strikers we think we thank Mario I Mario sometimes we kiss Mario's feet I feel like sometimes not enough Mario has his own games you'd think throw the Hat you'd think Aiden's the Waluigi pick because of his build but he's actually the toad pick in spirit he's meta he's just like Yosi cuz your misog dude I'm a really abnormal toad you're you're a Tall Toad that does a lot of drugs toad is just like nice Sky neutral am I DK what the yeah probably cuz you're originally a villain but now you're maybe friendly you think he Bowser well could be Bowser cuz of your evil energy I could be Bowser well just a little bit but like Bowser's kind of cool you know no Bowser like kidnaps women constantly no I've never kidnapped a woman I think I'm more DK cuz he likes big chilling yeah Banas end of the day he's in the Tre he's threatening he's threatening from afar you might think he's intimidated can I ask you what was so scary about me are you serious yes I'm serious I told you this I have seen right now to kill themselves well to be fair I do it too but like I have seen you go out of your way to make people feel like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a profile photo they're not sometimes they're not meand don't go after people yes you do youzy sometimes you go after random people who are famous online and you say I wish they would fly over the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pyramids in a paramotor they make fun of you so much yeah we are different people I don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you're my friend and sometimes they don't sometimes they just make things you don't like sometimes they sometimes they have they tweet at you with just an anime profile photo and you're just kill yourself I don't do that no I actually don't do that CH I actually don't do that and I never did I always have some reason most of the time it's Justified even though it's an over very few at the end of this rainbow if we find an example he'll be like but I haven't done that in a long time this PO will sh you won't find one that's the thing because I am consistent in my in I I think it's how judgmental you are of what other people put out and as someone who was putting out maybe she was scared what that's no I wasn't I wasn't putting out okay actually I used to have an anime profile photo in Discord and I changed it when I joined the yard what because of what I would have thought of it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I think it was death note I Chang sorry no I'll no what the hell was that more Japanese than me did you watch anime oh you're actually Japanese okay uh um nongo Boshi mosca when I met him he walked up to me and said that was insane he bowed at me it was weird did you actually bow at her I yeah I bowed was it a deep bow like like I do to 7eleven clerks that's got to be racist it's crazy awful I I don't know how but that's racist I mean you can make this call right here right now no that's you can end it all you can end the career right here you don't speak a lick of Japanese you don't speak a damn damn sentence but that doesn't make me less Japanese than you are you claiming you're more Japanese you're saying you're more Japanese my resume I speak at a six-month old proficiency okay wow I have watched all of Naruto yep you also are wearing been there four time you're wearing Aro pants you you have Japanese on your pants four time how many time have you been there I'm not gonna lie he's got me beat he is more Japanese than me that's you don't have to cave on this no no cuz I'm 25% Japanese so I'm already at a losing battle but if I've never been to Japan he's got me beat you've never even been mm I can show you around would you want to the motherland of course I can show you your Society dude the least Japanese I've ever heard there's a few rules we would need to teach you before you no eating and walking please the 12 things you must not lose the least Japanese I've ever felt having like con like Sea Dog uh come up to me and he's like yeah I can give you like some tips and tricks for Japan and I'm like I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Japanese but like you've got me beat I don't know anything [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Welsh guy no I know Burns in the sun that's right I know I know hilc too uh all right real quick name your favorite Co come on come on okay it's Nick [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] go yes now who would you kill who would you kill who you kill who would you kill forever I think I kill you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kill yourself the reason the reason why is because you like I think that the yard is good but like no I wanted an explanation why you'd kill me too that's fun well first of all you deserve it after the scheduling situation trap [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I was doing something with a gesture who was that it's a guy emotions never mind you know what you're sit okay but when slime is the best person that I can get to like schedule everything that's how I know it validates that you are really bad he got nothing going on on bro I realized s has all the the tools to like rip apart our fabric yeah she knows how she knows where all the seas are going on what what okay do you really think that's true you were big chilling yesterday what do you have going on jacking off I was on jack off for one for two beat my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you stri me as a guy that jacks off I'm it's it's like we all do it but that's still hurtful some of you don't want to hear that for sure you don't want to be the guy guy who shits for got be look it's true I don't have a lot going not as much as you sure but does that make me less of a person lwig that you jack off no that I don't that I I don't think jacking off makes you weird I don't and I want that known it's okay that you do this if anything it makes me more human I love being a girl in this podcast setting right now it's so great this is so great yeah can I level with you you you know as a as as a as a woman girl girl I was going to say look I respect oh my God I found out what that was the other day I'm not kidding I didn't know they looked like that why do you have that I I just wanted to come prar emergencies to a vampire we're losing all our street credit from one month early this year CU left that on our set and we've all been trying to figure out like how it worked yeah like when when is it okay to eat I guess right and if I put it in water is that when it grows no it turn to do with Dinosaur no it's actually an Obama Chia Pet I was going to I was going to ask from your perspective what is was so enjoyable about the show like you you watched it for for such a long time you're part of the community why do you like the show oh it's so okay like even when I was a smaller streamer the reason why I loved it is cuz every week it feels like a sitcom where like the reoccurring characters which are you guys are so like funny to me and so it was easy to listen to you guys tell stories and also your friends so you're telling stories that are like in the industry that I'm interested in which is really easy to listen to like it was so entertaining and your banter is really good I think you can tell when a podcast doesn't have like good banter but I'll speak for the girls of the yard too I feel like a lot of girls on the yard it's really not that degenerate you guys are not that bad okay what about that might be the nicest thing slime gets horny or Nick CS misogynistic I don't get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] horny one of those is true and one gets horny stop you get horny and you get Hella misogynistic I love women do you think I V I'm voting for one today massaging your jokes are kind of funny yeah I I mean you're point at Aiden while saying that as if to say right fellow woman hello and as the woman so if if lwig were to tragically just paramotor into the Sun and gone forever that's impressive right I think you would be in my top five of considerations repl okay first off why are you already planning on my replacement I have to be prepared you just get in an accident yeah it was a light accident this is my only Mark oh it's a light accient it was a light one it was a light one wait you made an entire video on a light accident yeah well if it was a heavy one I can't make the video you know you came into this podcast after that happened in a wheelchair and a neck brace yeah is a Survivor I recover quickly I have good genetics Sur of Road rack three weeks after that accident love you come to basketball Aiden I was a victim of a car crash that was you three weeks after I all I ask is if I die that you don't do the podcast for at minimum 7 months oh you want a seven month break you want a seven month blackout but every every week you upload a 1 hour eulogy of me do I have to keep my patreon membership during this yes of course you do if anyone in those seven months unsubscribes I will find you haunt you you're getting haunted and I will haunt you and five of you will die you don't want a french ghost on you be a goofy ass ghost I'm not don't call me goofy ass I would be goofy ass a goofy ass I would literally do really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Terri things dude see you would like juggle in front of somebody I wouldn't become visible I you would do that the finger thing where you can do them both counterclockwise I would go in your toaster and it it would come out [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] charred with like a message written in saying kill yourself with a gun ghost yourself G what well look I did some digging I don't like this I did some digging you're about to be not my favorite anymore o I got are you reallying to whis reallying to whis that will I'll make are you show jack off I look like a guy who beats off Aiden just know you will be up next okay if he slanders me you will be my favorite I am not slandering you at all you're slandering yourself the screen shot speak yeah so if you go to the next slide uh s wondered in 2024 this is a real screen she leaves the Discord will erase all her messages the answer is no I learned oh I didn't even leave too no she didn't leave that's a a very recent message this is August 19th this year this is right around Beyblade actually iume any idea if I leave this Discord it will erase all my messages or not and honestly I went through the messages by the way there was 164 Discord Pages worth no way hold Discord Pages yes how many total messages 5,000 that is wow that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] embarrassing how many do I have a total amount pledged of $800 oh my god well not counting do ations to MERS I'm going to kill myself was going to say she actually it's actually quite a bit less cuz she earned a lot of the money back how oh oh she forgot never mind continue this is good that you forgot oh wait cuz Aiden owes me money right ah thank you for the reminder I appreciate I'm a good guy what can I say they paid him at the casino and he's like actually that's too much give it back um zipper please okay so right off the bat August 2021 e years before a raving review the yard is my favorite podcast it's so good I don't know I like the banter it makes me happy wasn't this like at the start you know what's crazy she said this two minutes ago she actually did about after launch it was actually okay this was my whole like this is when I was getting into the Discord and I had to be like oh guys we all like the same thing you know I had to get comfortable we can keep going I've been doing everything in my power to not be blocked by slime on Twitter dude you are trying to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fit in you know you know what my scariest day was the day when you messaged me about my eye really yes because that was scary I didn't you to interact with me at all why no at all because what are you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] talking about dude you're you're Del you used to have notifications on for my tweets and then rate how TW they were bad we were not even [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] friends after that that's different enemies that's different you're my friend that's why I did that and and I just went on trip I was at a a Smash tournament in Switzerland and two different people came up to me on this trip and told me that they uh met slime in person and wanted to say hi because they recognized him from you know smash because they're both part of the melee community and that's generally a way to like connect and introduce yourself to people and slime slime got mad at both of them even though and they're not fans one of them came up he was like I wasn't a fan he was like mad at me for being a fan or something that's what I was mad about honestly there's been enough of these instances where the report has been obviously in the other person's favor that it's really a CO my fav part is when slime is like like come on give me some Grace like every really think do you really think I went up and was just M mean to someone who is nice to me yes this is annoying because the comments will be like dude SL I'm such an [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's it's literally well Trump is a president so I have to agree with the woman in this instance thank God for that too wait hold on uh I by the way what I messaged you about what gave you a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] heart attack when I first ever message you on Twitter it was when you got SC the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of me it was when you got your cat your cat scratched your eye eyb [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up eyeball and you message her because we have a friend we we I know somebody who the same thing happened and it really it it was like very like serious and they like lost vision and stuff like that and I said don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] around with that I know someone that happened and don't want to scare you but soon getting the message don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] around I literally said be careful better to be safe you know it was a really nice message like I was like dude I have to step in here she like don't interact with me ever again I remember this this coming up at the time cuz I thought of the same friend because her life was like derailed for for years because of this and I this happened to you and I was like I hope to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] God this does not happen to s what I didn't just hope I acted you're actually the reason I went to the doctor you are but the thing is is when you interact with me like I end up now being on your for you page cuz you've dm'd me and I don't want that to be the case cuz what if I make a tweet and he's like kill yourself [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you're stupid the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this is say kill yourself [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you're stupid but he might secretly put you in a not funny bucket for the rest of your life I'm I'm the misogynist women fear for their lives around slime how how did I swing this I don't do that if someone's unfunny for 100 tweets and then their 100 first tweet is funny I'm like ah we're back that's true you you're okay if Jake lucky drops a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Banger hell yeah I'm not kidding is that but but but then the next tweet he goes right back down then he's lost it okay all right he had it for a bit so he has a streak yeah I feel like it's meritocracy is everybody on like a funny chart for you no not necessarily I I think I'm very easily swayed in the moment I've avoided interactions with you like in person too events that we've gone to just cuz I'm like oh man I don't want to be unfunny so I just leave this is such fan behavior my God it is bro you're like the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] food critic from ratat Tuli and then everyone else is like like you know just like a like a food vendor like a street vendor and so every when you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] come around they shut they shut their doors I don't Maybe by what s is saying maybe this is true but I think sinna is a freak anomaly yeah's crazy she's probably crazy I'm not a freak okay I'm just I just watched many she's saying you walk in the venue and and you're like Omar little bro and and the music starts to play wait why did you say ratat like that by the way ruli aren't you French yeah how do would you how would you say if you're trying to like impress like a like a family member ruli that's racist you're trying you're trying to talk toah about ruli what do you say by the way I played some ultimate with with have you guys seen Jiggly Puff's name in France yeah yeah what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is all that I don't know R Rond R that's a good name it means round thing that roll roll that's what yeah do is roll so it's it's R round round Ral that's so clever yeah and I made it up uh next slide please zipper uh yes point in the Slime Camp of of funny I slept on my carpet the other day because I thought it would be funny I did do that I did did you do it cuz I do that were you just like alone in your house and you're like I'll sleep on the floor today were you going through a hard time I was wildly depressed in 2021 and so I was like you know [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it I would just ended stream one day and I was like I just sleep on the floor like this is cool and I slept like there's like I had a master uh or like a queen bed in like a small room and so it wasn't like a master room or anything and like there's just a tiny little space where I could walk between my TV and the bed and I was like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it we'll just see how it goes it feels nice it's like a coffin yeah did you ever do it again no nights in a row will [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you up one night I was like I'm cool maybe that's slime's curse maybe maybe he's slept on the floor too much evil Daymon in his brain I do said on the floor I like it like where on on your house I have a big Ikea rug in my living room that I sleep on have you ever had like a girlfriend so for days at a time no that's cruel I I do so when I am dating someone one I will end up you know what's funny if I'm start to see someone I'll sleep in my bed more okay as like to get Ready's in the bed rolling around like comt you know this might get serious get back in form yes exactly I start practicing for the for the big game and then when I'm dating someone I I definitely do make I sleep in a bed way more um and then if I if I end up being single I will sleep on the floor it is kind of a good way to chart whether or not I'm seeing some it's like a reward for being single again oh I can go back to the floor bro you have no idea if you guys get in fights do you just go back in the living room I'm out of here just go sleep onor F fine I don't need to take this it's funny toor it's funny too cuz I'll pitch the floor sometimes I'll be like you know the floor is pretty comfy sleepover like it be crazy and then I remember this one girl was say she's like no and I'm like okay okay that's fine I get it I'm not yeah I'm not talking about you want to watch a movie at 2 a.m. fall asleep there fall fall asleep some romantic [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we have to finish the movie we do this every night type [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you like do everything to like bait her into the living room when she's a dog you're like here you go I have all your favorite things uh so you this is yeah September 1st 2021 I slept on my carpet the other day guess I thought it would be funny well okay it was funny I laughed 82021 God I love love Jill Biden's breathtaking what time is that 10:27 in the morning I was at work that's crazy that's a little early to be saying yeah I don't think that's that's out of pocket what time what time do you used to go to work uh 7:00 a.m. I work till 5 you've been there for a few hours you had a coffee yeah and so I just I would just sit there and like there's this like Christian old lady that sat next to me shared a desk with me and I would just TW like type these things what was that L go ahead did I ever think about what I didn't finish old lady we're talking about old lady old lady I think she actually passed by the way you want to continue that I'm just kidding she didn't everything about her [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] let me find out let me find out did you ever have a coworker like oh what are you listening to oh yeah I had a my CFO I work directly under him he uh walked up to me while I was watching the yard on my computer and he goes what is this and I was like oh it's just a podcast and he's like are they like college frat guys and I was like no they're not they look like exactly I mean he was like a big college Frack guy too he was so that's why he thought she he wants a fat boy podcast recognize real though if we ever had that bar stool deal he might have end up listening to us you guys would have bonded well when I tell people that I'm 25% white they I tell them that I listen to the yard and that's how it validates it cuz the yard is like very you know it's probably the aren't like the first black person you've ever had on here I would hate if that was true because I'm very pale I'm half black but I think that's true no we're working our way up I don't think we should think about it I don't think we think you know what's funny a guy came up to me at Evo a black guy came up to me he's like dude love the yard you guys got to get some more black people on that show and I'm like you're right if you know any yeah goes I have a few okay I'll send them over your way why is laugh he's laughing because Aiden's laughing because I told him my big secret which is I have a Rush on Santa Claus yep that's why I'm laughing yeah the fictional creature fictional creature creature fictional about Santa Claus so funny well Aiden so we got a sidebar real quick we got to support him in this so tell us more about your crush on Santa Claus well he's a big guy and he loves to eat loves to eat and I especially around the holidays when he too busy to go grocery shopping so how does he eat like fresh food you that's the thing when he's driving around in the Big Sky plane delivering presents to all of us he can't but my job is to turn this Crush into a reality of a night a reality you want to have a DAT with him I want I want to I want to charm Santa into my bedroom and how will where where does the dining and the eating come in well if he's hungry he's not going to want to hang out so you clearly you've already guessed it we're in a hellofresh ad and our and our intro to this seems to skip over the fact that you could be making meals in in a short time period mailed directly to your door and like Santa's toys

myself a boner not a boner lover that's a very different profile picture Nick that's a very different thing I have no idea next again were you doing a lot of work so this next one's interesting oh wow

canceled cuz you went on to Ellen walking walking anyone joining walking slightly ahead look and this is this seems like it's an isolated moment there were many moments in the 5,000 messages where C would say anyone want to walk there were and not all of them were taken up there were some moments where she said anyone want to go you still walk if no one wanted to go on a walk no it was me and like three other people that were always down and and like the virtual yard Discord walk we just bored who started the walk uh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't know were you the first Walker I'm I'm seeing a trend these are always at 10:30 a.m. I'm I'm out I'm tell first well it's cuz in California you in California yeah so actually for me that means it was 7: a.m. cuz I was in Virginia so these are 7 a.m. messages dude that's not that works No 3 hours 3 hours would be 3 hours 130 fine good I'm not voting today yet so don't you know she's still waiting she's waiting for banks to change his mind I'm

a Thursday so Trump is announced president and he lost by one vote wa thought this was a trump episode it's not H it is and it's because of s are you where you live in Virginia now no I live in Austin now I lived in Virginia back then oh not swing state do you think banks was paid to endorse Trump no he said no he went on his on stream and he was like no a lot of tweets came out at the exact same time I'm saying I think it's just cuz it's the day before the election I don't think they're paid Banks has always been like a trump guy hasn't he I I think I honest to God think it's because the price of crypto will go up if Trump wins sorry when Trump won you might need this dub when Trump won if you want if you don't want FaZe Banks to become homeless vote for DT I've changed my humor for example my name on door Dash is now huge ass you know how we were saying like can someone post out I funny you know if someone makes a funny joke and then they do something unfunny they've lost it

Reddit every day anymore no no this one this one ready for the day you know what and you guys are going to laugh and Gall at me as a as a beating off looking man but I don't even care about this being

wondering if him just like streaming in the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] insane Facebook Minds changed him like he's just streaming on like this lonely platform to like ghosts in the walls and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's what I feel like YouTube is like though isn't it no oh my God no it's like who are you talking to people real people with real Souls some of them use their full names on their on the account got their government names on that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's like a child on their mom's account you know what I mean you see like a Jennifer whatever I'm talking to Z Adams yeah sometimes I talk to like Jennifer hughes's Son but it's Jennifer hughes's account but we're still talking cuz yeah cuz she's not saying lwig UNC ass stories skoj who the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you talking to lwig UNC ass

right no no literally are you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy CRA to that you think about it if you think about it he's closing in he's a walking tube I'm sorry I don't mean to put this back at you but oh

second you guys are getting all the smoke great so yeah yeah so he's the second favorite what's the ranking then it's lwig and or yeah she'd kill you right so yeah it's you red yeah yeah yeah you're Kad wow so you would listen to a podcast of Nick and Aiden that's the advice show you over me she actually specifically said she loves the advice I lik the advice show especially when you guys were on it now when you were on it your advice slime advice it'd be better if you weren't alive yeah slime is like oh yeah it'd be better if you just killed yourself to be I never said that no way he said that he he has said I think you would really like freak mad he does get mad at the people who ask questions you know you said podcast yeah you remember that well I never I never I wasn't that far back I asked did you ever write into the advice show no no I wasn't that sad but what I would do I'm kidding what I would do is like the Slime like slime was for example when I would listen and I knew he was going to be on it I was like I just brace myself for every time he gives an answer it'll be a little bit insightful and then he goes but to be honest with you you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stupid and you should have never wrote this and I'll be like oh you know what's you know what's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up you know what's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up is in that room when we're selecting the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] questions they say the same [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they're like I don't know why you'd [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] submit this I don't know [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] why and he says it and he says it and the difference is I say it with my damn I'm sorry I'm saying it about questions I don't pick and also saying it about people who don't have to hear me say it to them cuz that would be hurtful like can you imagine going to your a therapist right your therapist might think that you're this is not a repl for therapy that is no I agree but like imagine you're in like therapy and your therapist thinks that what you're saying is stupid but out loud they just go yeah that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stupid hear that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] real I slime keeps it 100 do you think I'm just a soft leftist I think I think you're your perception is very accurate you're appable liberal and that's why Trump won yeah I mean you didn't vote you a swing state voter abstained today well Virginia I I did what in Texas guys what did you say what what did you say that's the last page of the C files if we could just hold off sorry we will get there eventually is there more yes there is oh my God how are we feeling today I'm crushing a chiv and onion Bagel right now my breath will be beautiful after how about you guys edited I like this edited message by the way great probably made a typo this is great I'm I'm known for big typos

and for the last one you could say I'm in the yard D because you finally made it here wow oh my God it is it is a very in right behind me isn't it it's a big full circle moment isn't it I mean that's from 2021 and so going from like you know at my normal job where I was not really a streamer back then to like this is pretty crazy you stream back then too uh yeah but like like 10 viewers and like once a weekend oh this when you reaching out to other streamers and stuff oh my God I I was talking about collabs I was talking about collabs oh my God you're interpreting it in a weird way s this is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up the last message you sent was one of the ones he showed about uh deleting messages you haven't spoken in the Discord in two months what happened did you switch up and forget where you came from yeah what if idea the the fame hit she forgot where she came from look we've got we've got Nick Zone we've got slime Zone we could build a a beacon of our biggest fan we can have C's own channel we could build a shrine for you please don't do that and it's just all my message Vlogs in there in control it's only walk it's only Walkers Walkers only I like the idea of paying you know that Memorial with all the veterans names on it pay for a big marble Memorial but it's all of sin's Discord messages etched into stone out there in the world right now who are like yeah I used to walk with sin all the time we haven't walked a month oh they still tweet me like uh there's one guy uh bralic is his name and then somebody else there's like a few other people that I've actually met fost I've met I met him at twitchcon and like they're the ogs that used to interact with me in the yard Discord I still remember them I follow them on Twitter and everything they're yeah they're they're viewers of the yard they don't really watch me oh okay yeah but that's crazy they they used to walk with you they don't watch you they don't no no we're not we're not we're not Ty with you until you run exactly and then it's hard to catch up I don't even know if they watch the yard still some of them I mean look sometimes you pH out of content Adam rusia is a slaughtered slain corpse on my YouTube algorithm floor Jes chivate like yeah was so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dark so makes good [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] appear into my crazy this is the kid Cy talking to Selena Gomez clip like you hear that see that video on Facebook where that the cop shot that guy in his wife and he's like oh my God what is wrong with you I like that he's like yeah and it was live too it was live it was crazy what was the moment you you you knew this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] was real s what was the moment you were like I'm a streamer oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't even know I still haven't had that moment I feel like I'm not there you're dumb as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm sorry that was super rude I actually want you to kill yourself voting for it every day I feel like that's a surprising answer because you see it's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lie Aiden it's Sur it's not a lie 10 10 no but like how I think about it is I'm I'm one of those people where I just keep going so like everything I do I keep going I've never had like my like my moment where I'm sitting there and I'm like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this is really crazy and I feel I keep saying the wall is coming like that wall of like emotion where I'm going be like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this year has been insane is right around the corner but I haven't had it yet I'm very like my dad like made me this way where I'm just like okay well you did good but you got to keep going in order to do better so we just go go go like enjoy that stuff I know I'm learning I have like a soundboard like after a good stream you know the end of The Breakfast Club yeah play that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] don't I go I go ah I play that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and then I just let that song Rock and I just look as my chat Fades away he does sometimes yeah I I cried tears I feel like that's the moment that I'm like I I haven't had yet is like a real thing where like I I mean even la like being in La for a month that's a really surreal thing for me cuz we got like a huge house got everything I never a year ago would have thought I'd be doing the things I'm doing now wait when you say we what who who's that uh we is like uh wo and Rosie who are like my team they're like my my my homies so they like she got the dude from Dragon Ball Z with her [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] M damn does he have the bad man jacket I you even know what Dragon Ball Z is don't you hate anime n it's different oh it is different you know I came from the Dragon Ball Community originally by the way really Dragon Ball Community what that inenta game or show what is that me I'm part of the House MD Community I used to be a Dragon Ball YouTuber what yeah because the three idiots who do a lot of Dragon Ball games and stuff like that on YouTube they're like some of the biggest dragon ball YouTubers were like my friends early on and like we would do stuff together all the time and I was deep in the Dragon Ball Community but I would like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on it fighting Community or no like like just reacting like stuff for the anime doing like power scaling tier list all that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I do that and it was it was fun there's got to be this for do you know about the guy that got mad at me uh because when air Toriyama died and oh I know all about this sure I'm sure yes I know you're probably mad as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] at him that day oh my God that's when she switched I didn't think that was most insane but thing I said but I I don't think that was crazy I gen still to this day I understand that might have been insensitive but then this guy responded who was a Dragon Ball YouTuber and then he was like he posted a curatory Yama and then the yard as like Google search results and then I responded that like aren't you supposed to go to bed or something cuz he said was logging off for the night and then he like made fun of my dead dad and I was like and I was like wa and uh and you know it's just Twitter stuff but I was wondering do you know that guy no uh I don't remember is he one of these Dragon Ball YouTubers no not my like OG they don't all know each other well yeah do you think we we all look alike too is iing to say whoever has clipped this it's not what you think out of context that clip is going to hit it's going to hit um no I don't know that guy I don't remember but I do remember that cuz I'm friends with like everyone and so I just remember like seeing it I was like oh it's like world's colliding I some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for that that's fine yeah you don't have to name anyone but do you have mortal enemies um no you don't seem like you have enemies I get along with a lot I'm very like like I said I forgive a lot of people I just will keep things in the back of mind like if you wrong me I'll be like hey I forgive but never forget I might not forget it but I won't hold it against you is that truly forgetting that's what Hees forgiving I think it's forgiving it's like uh it's like anybody like I've had friends that have wronged me and like I forgive them and they're very nice to me but like I just trust them a little bit less cuz I'm like hey you know we could never probably be as close they can earn back the trust yeah that's what it is it would be ignorant to simply just forget right I mean you would then you would walk into the spikes again yeah I think that makes you ignorant this is what lwig says he does no Ludwig's different goes away forever he cast no he creates castles of systems and in the dungeon with Adam rusi do you guys have mortal enemies yeah well actually Jimmy Fallon I did want to talk about Logan Paul for a moment oh dude oh can I leave this clip and that's all anyway uh AR she put her through a door uh you do something that I think there just might be a UT trait it's you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you you think of scenarios different than how they happened oh yeah I'm a big overthink I mean you know about the one I didn't know that no not that the meat one oh the the steak yeah oh my god that actually kept guys I would love to know what the meat want I'll tell you like the first ever cutie event that I went to was a summer concert and afterwards we go to a dinner that's like just at a you know down the street and they were like oh order whatever like anything on the menu and so meat yeah so meat and they were like hey order anything so me and two other friends were like oh order the the wagy stick steak that's like on there it's very fancy it is the thing you order when you say anything and I saw nobody else order it like at all it was just us I'm feeling like guilty right [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] how much was it Santa how much was the steak wasn't it like $150 oh $150 well you must have got a lot couple hundred bucks you probably got a bunch of cartoon steak sharable portion it was not you know but it like a few slices huh it was just tiny bit a few slices maybe it was like one bite bro a lollipop well the thing that made me feel worse was no one else orders it and then they like I guess had to meet a quota for the tab so L goes hey uh this is after all of the food has come out he goes hey we're going to order more rounds of everything because we need to hit a quota if you haven't already like order some steak or something if you want to and it was like he gave permission for people to do it and he looks over and very briefly he just makes eye contact like this and then like looks away dude and it made me feel like he was like oh this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ordered it on our dime and didn't say anything so I for was it 3 months yeah no you sat you sat on this oh for three months I wanted to send him a long apology no goes you always misremember stuff but like it's the eyes he G like he went like this after he said it I had a nice pregnant pause cuz well I I was paying for it cuz cutie like didn't have her card and then it was like it was like something ridiculous the amount of money needed to be spent for that room it was like a few thousand or some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] wasn't it cuz it was like a private room that she had booked was the only way she could have had everyone she was trying to do a nice thing for everyone who came to the concert sure and we weren't close we were like halfway there or something so and the wag is the most expensive one so I was like yo if anyone wants to order some crazy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] how was it can you tell everyone the table they I don't think you finished it no no I didn't yeah so little she didn't finish hous no but I felt so bad about it when he looked at me that I that I didn't I didn't want to finish it so the thing is I liter I legitimately wanted people to order I just thought it was funny well what I felt like when I told them was like like I felt like I had two parents that I was about to get in trouble with cuz I stayed at their house 3 months later and they're both in the kitchen he like just got back from a trip and I'm like sitting there feeling real guilty and I go what cutie like I just I have to confess something to you and then I tell them and he's like S I didn't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like I don't care dud I hadn't thought about it a month it was like a child coming up being like I threw up and cleaned it up 6 months ago it's like okay okay that's all right that's good she's like she's like balling she like I can't believe I've done it like this is fine so you're an overthinker is what I'm oh yeah I have DMS with people he knows one of them I have DM some people we like I think about it to this day and I want to DM them and say like I'm really sorry that I was weird was slasher imagine if he had messaged slasher like I want to suck you dry I'm just saying as anag that was not at all what I said it was not this feels like it's moving you're making did you slide I slid on someone the but I did not say I want to stuck you dry i s them Michael Scott finger guns and I said hey which is worse which is worse no no no no no oh I thought was just so lovely did you say I want to suck you Dy a slasher yes to many people masterful way to get us out s you slid and you sent Michael gotot finger guns you you said this on Cutie's podcast right yes and it made me want to die I hate it but you didn't say the person knows it oh okay you didn't say the person can we sens it no no no no I we can you have to censor that you have to censor it okay no listen I need a sensor and you have to cover his mouth too cuz they will read it they would try to get the story on me forever yeah sure we won't we won't let you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] have it that is not who I thought it was I would never in a million years have guessed he responded yeah and then I made it worse cuz I sent five messages back yeah you're a five you're a fumbler what were the five the Five Fingers of Death five different Michael Scott yeah I literally just sent like messages basically being like Oh well if you ever want to play games as friends let me know um but I made a typo and I accidentally said not as friends so then I oh my God bro this how do you say not well because I was trying to say if you ever want to play games no I tried to say not in a weird way but I backspaced it and then I put tried to say in a friend way but it came out as not in a friend way dude you ran it down that's really you want to play like Halo like sexually like BS out like I don't know stupid well yes I did that and I sent him like three more messages after that were like paragraphs that were two hours apart saying hey I'm so sorry that I did this please forgive me and he never responded after I have I have empathy for this because I think this is the type of person that I used to be really yeah are you more confident now yeah with with this stuff I mean I think as far as this being applied to dating this was like when I was like 18 and 19 this super super overthink well I'm 27y old woman so I'm going to throw that dream out of the door I think I'm still like you sometimes with just social situations and like overthinking uh when you get trans fobic online yeah oh my God D yeah that'll happen for specific we slip up you know comes out all dude I don't want to talk about it the you have no idea how much this has consumed my life things we think Aiden and some things we say and then you made a mistake it's about knowing which bucket's which I've talked to so many people yeah we know you have a whole Discord set up it's called Aiden's Hell in a Cell and he'll and he'll and he'll talk to you no no that's not what's happening racial issues I honestly problems I I learned some things this last week I had some very long conversations with some people and I I don't want to waste time on the podcast but I you know something important to me so like learning more and and talk to I was a little talk [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you guys [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you guys that's my to any guys that's it in time thank you so much but I I do the same thing I I think I you know what's the the most recent example or maybe not most recent was when I saw uh we had George not found on the podcast like a long time ago we had like a group of Minecraft people right and then that's the worst episode of the yard Yeah by far the May one of the worst have you listen to it it's when there was seven people I believe I did listen to that one yes and it was a lot there's just too many voices I'd probably just delete that one it's probably the best because you can Rel listen to it and hear different conversations every time it's Timeless episode if you think book uh I I I had like an awkward Interac action where I think the second time you see people in like streaming and Industry you sort of had this idea of like you sort of become friends or acquaintances with people and you feel kind of familiar but you don't really know them that well I think there's this often this interaction of like you meet somebody for the second or the third time and you feel connected to them so you hand shaking feels too formal a lot of people hug and then there was this awkward interaction where like I hugged him but it he seemed surprised by it and then I feel awkward that I did that and then I don't want to make anybody uncomfortable so then I saw him at like somebody's birthday party like months later and then like apologize about it I me yeah you zesty approach a man and then he doesn't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right and it's like people just don't remember those things in the same way that you do and I I think on the other end of it I I think like a friend apologized to me recently for something he did to me in like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] high school and I didn't even remember what he was talking about but he apologized so sincerely and it's funny how those things just mean that certain interactions from your perspective stick so vividly in your head everything sticks for me it's so like even at the the party we went to cu's party I do this thing where in order to avoid approaching people and I'm worried that I'm going to make it weird I will just it's I do it at every party I walk a perimeter of a party just repeatedly over and over again and I hope that I accidentally run into a situation where like we're crossing paths and then I can go hey and we talk likeing so that that way I don't have to walk up and go Hi l you know what I mean cuz that feels weirder to me I don't to do that similar that what you're doing is insane certifiably but I do I do understand the anxiety of being opening conversation being locked into one and then exiting you know that awkward thing at a party we're like okay I'm going to go not talk to you this is I feel bad the other way around I my my biggest social anxiety as the resident socialite as uh is this moment at the party where I see somebody that I haven't seen in a while and I want to talk to them like uh I was talking to John Moshi and we're at the end of like this Hall at that party and we're in a situation where it's like just the two of us and also I am just because of the way we started talking I'm between him and the rest of the party hey John John John I have to talk to you for a while screen taking respond my no one can hear you here by the way so you like how I'm dressed and you are dressed very se you and I was in a Playboy bunny outfit and that's a he was it was like half a Playboy bunny out what do you think Playboy is I was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hot dude you're a bit of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you the just pulling his shirt down be like like stop it I said zipper 3 was there I'm like he is so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and she's like he's my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] she she was in the robe and the captain's hat and everything yeah she was you Hefner and she's like is this she she asked me she like is this costume problematic and I'm like no I think you're taking the power back I think it's F yeah a girl does it it's funny also at the party you did she she did the the Mr President I went up to her I was like oh S I don't think we've ever met in person no well we met one time at cutie sing but that was when I avoided you so I don't count it and um and wait I thought you said we met in Texas oh my God we did Texas yeah but we didn't speak I also avoided you then too cuz I was listening to the art actively back then but it was when I visited Texas uh I went to schlatt's house cuz I had friends like they were like oh yeah come and it was like barely anybody there it was like a very mini Halloween party that you guys went to this is the same party where you you figured out how schlatt looks at YouTube and money oh yeah then the backyard yeah you guys the backyard mhm I remember I was the BR girl from A Goofy Movie there's two of us uh cuz me and the other girl had the same costume I remember there was like a total of 12 people there and I remember being in that room I was with extra Emily actually she was with me and we're like standing in the kitchen and I said oh I'm not going outside cuz it was you guys and schlatt talking I know anyone else there besides schlatt yeah we only knew you understand I was feeling the same way cuz like I only know this guy and I knew Nick and so I was like you know I'm I'm shy too but but you came up to me at the party uh this this weekend in Halloween party and I was like oh hey what's up and I instantly want to talk to you about scheduling cuz lewick is being a dick the whole time right classic I was like don't say classic like you know I don't know would know I basically know you I mean I listen to you complained about you for 3 years straight so we go and I I'm like oh my God hey and then I kind of like go for a hug and then you go for a handshake and then I'm like oh yeah sure and then I go for a handshake to like that's what and you have like this stern look on your face and I'm like oh okay and then you're like oh no we can hug and then we hug oh god what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I was like that was insane anyway when you want to do the podcast I didn't think about it cuz I don't care and I was like I have a mission to do which is get information so it wasn't awkward for me but now I know that you uh are a tortured soul in your mind I've blocked it out like that interaction I've blocked out of my mind fully cuz Caroline at that party came up to me she goes s like you look very skittish she's like is everything okay and I was like yeah I just I'm just get stressed out you know what I mean cuz I just like even that interaction with you I probably walked away from it I was like all right well I guess I got to see him now for the podcast I think there's just this General underlying anxiety if you enjoy meeting and talking to people and you're just excited to meet anybody not everybody has that same energy or wants to spend that time like getting to know you in that social situation yeah so you don't want to like make them feel like they're trapped in a conversation or something I I feel like I actually understand how you feel dude at this at this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] party it's like League of Legends okay at this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] part you're aren't you okay sorry go ahead that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up sorry I'm sorry I don't play league he only has till January oh no dude he's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] make a wish episode for Ludwig's plat run oh no I'm good I will make it I will make I'll make it I'll make it I'll make it I'll make it what's the punishment I no punishment I just don't get a comment from Tyler one I look I guess the punishment is that I was wrong I am bad at the game I have internal damnation yeah hell take you that long to real of video games oh I'm not bronze in League though so you're bro you're are you higher no I'm nothing nothing she has no want to I can do it if aliens come down to earth she says RPS I guess wait that's a good Marathon idea for you I'm not kidding League no it's a horrible one I think by the end of that I will actually kill myself race to Silver You' kill your channel halfway through that is true I would I better to stop playing games that I really love because of that reason cuz I can't just do them when I'm live all the time cuz I do crazy stuff but I like to do them at night now like now I get to do them at night what is your favorite game uh I don't know I like a lot of Nintendo games that's always fun I'm just I'm not a competive gorer answer uh what do I like Among Us Mario party and the tennis racket I just got Madden so fun a big smash you know what I mean if like anybody just want to relate no I I actually don't play Smash only because of you guys what do you mean you don't play because of you're the only person to ever say that I think no it's because it's scary like I'm like oh man they just get into it I'm like I'm not that competitive you are a composed of anxiety you're like a beehive of anxiety yeah wait you're not competitive you strike me as competitive like if you went to mini golf with friends you'd really want to win mini golf is totally different though like I could play mini golf mini golf is like the spirit of competition between friends everybody think they can do it yeah yeah it's where the rubber meets the road it's the ultimate party game everyone thinks they're going to win Mario Party with your friends that'd be fun like I'd be competitive about that but like I'm not going to play valerin you know I'm I know I'm not good at Shooters I've accepted that so what's the difference between something like Mario Party and something like valerant in terms of Mario part is more fun you know there's a cute little character on there skill ceiling skill floor okay I think she wants a Level Playing Field to be competitive without the time that's needed to put in to have a Level Playing Field yeah okay don't play Mario Party with Nick if you feel that way are you a douchebag no just a misogynist you a long someone's called me a douchebag I haven't even heard that in a

took a stock from void or was it void yeah you won the so void had one stock and ultimate and lwi had all three but lwig took the first St took the first one W and this guy is so-called world's greatest gamer interesting anyway then we go to Call of Duty Black Ops okay lwigs idea just saying I remember this I left right before we got Call of Duty Black Ops it's a 4v4 and and Nick as we're as we're setting up we do a team draft teams are pretty balanced pulls out $700 scuff controller everyone else keyboard player this same day by the way on broadcast he goes man you know who wins whoever's got the controller he says this on broadcast you were there for this I play with controller whips out Xbox controllers there yes everyone else uses keyboard to because that's how they play the game T plays with a keyboard and then instantly whips out the sniper starts just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] getting pulled out the sniper because L was like oh you're on controller and I'm like okay I'll make it harder first sniping is harder on controller I was going to say is a controller harder though no not with a regular gun so he admits it it's easier of course it is he admits it it is that's how I play the game and and guess what happen SL what happened lwig Nick puts it on All-Star performance I just generational dude gener James hard out there he got a collat he got a collat head shot with the that's not the controller T looked at me he went holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dude there was a part in the crew battle where we were Drafting and I was it was between lein and atwall and I'm like atal are you good he's like yeah yeah I'm good at COD and I was like okay I'll take Leen I thought it was fair yeah I took lein they have tens I can use a controller that's fine look in the I you know 10 was only 02 I get what you're getting at but this is the world's greatest gamer competition no this is the after party the drunk people at the world it's the after party of the world's great you're the world's greatest Gamers I'm playing oh then never mind thank you you L is also desperate to fill out the team so you're not a g I have to defend my name sake all weekend people were coming up to me they're like I heard you're the Cod guy how do I play COD what are the good settings what are the strategies so when I play I can't just get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on and you're like and let if I get

do is Crush game one then we fun mode for the rest of the night also You' do great on keyboard mouse you're acting like you'd be a child yeah that's that's the hole in your argument you usually pretty logically sound with your arguments but you were saying like keyboard and mouse what's that it's like you you can play keyboard and mouse uh very easily you're pretty good with it why didn't you do it in your gaming be T in melee with a box I plague with controller shouldn't have brought it up it's just about you're usually so logically sound it's a rare te thank you I'm team Nick swiss cheese of tiebreaker oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I might be team lwig I might be I'm so sorry everybody thank you for watching cheese why is the cheese because everybody else is playing with controller you pull out a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] $700 this is socer sumoto socer zoto pulling out his neest controller to play against you hurt people hurt people yeah that's what this is look at what you've become I'll never forget this C this is the beginning of our our greatest you've been bumped up favorite she all she didn't fire you she quits yeah I'm just I'm over it well is it everything you've ever dreamed of to be on the yard episode was actually really nice it's not over yet we still got like we're only 30 minutes in so well I'm having a lot of fun actually so I'm okay with that too dude I was really nervous coming here actually no no okay [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you guys all right it's cuz it's like really scary and the first time I was technically supposed to be on it I was really glad that we didn't do it why why would this be scary compared to your because you're very successful now you're doing so many stream collabs you're part of so many things why would this be particularly scary I don't I I think it's again it's a full circle moment like it's just something I've listened to for forever and so now being involved in an episode is so weird to me it's very my brain can't comprehend it I'm kind of like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] okay you do a lot of collabs I'm going to ask for anxiety rank tier list doing cutie concert doing the yard doing agent collab doing poke podcasts uh well I didn't do Pokey podcast I did the collab with her yesterday oh my bad that one was Peak cuz I was that was you were actually very nervous Terri that's clean no yeah my hands were actually so sweaty they were like dripping Were You live before she came on yep that's why oh well I mean even before that like when I was getting ready I kept having to like wipe down my hands when I was doing my makeup cuz they were so sweaty I like terrified um and then the second one would be the Cutie podcast or the Cutie the Cutie show okay that's cuz I'm not a singer so concert wise [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that us we know yeah the yard is next not bad but it's like also it helped a lot that I've met you guys like prior to which is I think why I'm really happy I didn't do it the last time because now I've actually gotten to like talk to a lot of you which makes it a lot easier yeah I mean me you and I suffered the most awkward handshake hug exchange ever probably they say it's the worst dap of all time dud it was JX and Le and world's greatest holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] was there a bad dap it was oh that's cuz it's a swed fin thing you blg JX is also Swedish yeah you're such a close enough such a bastard all weekend he was saying Swedish and I'm like maybe or something I don't know I don't want to correct him be wrong and then easiest one's agent yeah but that's cuz he and I like slowly became friends he's very nice yeah he's very easy to talk to realize he's he's me he little Bros me he's what he's Canadian yeah who or do you have like a connection with Canadians no I don't like them but I didn't realize he was Canadian like I just never would have day yeah he doesn't like worst part of his day he's part only part he's one of the good ones how can you be half Canadian is that a thing I'm just I don't know I'm Canadian and then I became American he's voting in the election he's not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Canadian so he can't be part Canadian he voted for Trump before he before he became well after he won you know dual citizenship that's just dual citizenship you have toce they toce they say when you become American citizen you're supposed to anounce suppos to you're supposed to I need you to stand before the state department and say I renounce say it say on this pod you will renounce I will not renounce take him away you go you go off to your he'll he'll go he'll go on like pilgrimage like a white

bank account there now it's huge in [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Multicultural Geneva I hate that he does this man I hate why don't we get a Swiss bank account ever a Swiss bank account you don't got Swiss bank account money bro you know what I did do you know what it's kind of wild in Geneva I'm not kidding I got lunch with I got lunch with uh a close friend of mine and three Swiss bankers and I just asked them questions about their job it was very interesting was it was it was it like a boring like Banker job like you would ask a Chase accountant here like it I think they they had to answer questions are answered like vaguely in in like these boring terms that clearly mask the it's like it's like they can't explicitly tell me what's going on but this is also the guy that might be making up the deal to like sell India's water rights dring down that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy like that's that's but they can't tell me that you know do you know what I mean it was it was very it was very you L with three sex traffickers I think to their I think to their credit they actually explained to me a lot of history of their specific bank because it was like private and the Nazi gold end up washing on the river we cleansed we CLE the evil to internally Pride themselves on in comparison to their counterparts I was uh you know but I I just it was not us it's the other on and they were all they were all very very nice that a really good accent yeah have you practiced that I've been watching a German YouTuber who's obsessed with the Nintendo 64 oh okay what is it in what way he's just obsessed with how it works he's making his own Mario game he told me about this to I love see micro code I'd love to see your YouTube recommended it's pretty boring I'm not going to lie it's a lot of speedrun stuff it's a lot of like War uh updates on like middle Asian bunny X compilations I'm I'm 34 to the Bone those are his masturbation session things oh you said Asian bunny X I don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with that oh I jerk [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] from the [Music] mind dude dude she's a content creator gamer I I don't jerk off to that I watch her play Super Mario Sunshine do you think people have a Fant this is a real question if you have a Fantasia is it harder to beat off from your mind yes yes but maybe it's the feeling I don't know can you see the Apple in your head uh if I like think of an apple yeah okay is it detailed I can't get creative though like if I try to think of something that it's not Peter Griffin's eating the Apple well that's Peter Griffin already exists but you know what like Peter Griffin's naked this is really actually I don't like funny this is really funny is this is this sexual harassment asking your female coworker to imagine Peter Griffin naked you know it's like things that like already existed in the space and I'm weirdly I think I've seen Peter Griffin naked so I think I can he's smiling but his belly's covering his penis so he's naked but you don't see anything not when he's the belly doesn't cover the penis when lwe shows you it on his phone well that's different ones for us Aiden y you guys are the ones by the way that introduce me to Mario goti let's go that was fire that was that was fire crazy I sent that to a lot of people and all because of the Pod it was kind of funny people like like who in your life would you send that to uh my grandma your aunt like all it's funny as I also sent it to your grandma having read thousands now of your Discord messages it feels like I've read your text messages it's dirty crazy cuz you'll say something and I'm like yeah you've said that before no don't I don't text like that that much though the one thing I pride myself on that I've never done it started sealing Slimes like oh something bears like I've never done that I that's bad no slime has definitely like permeated into the language of how we talk to each other and like even like our partners yeah yeah yeah dude they all them them ass girlfriends say Bears all the time steals your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and and finds out [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up last week too what' you do well I talked about how I was smoking in Japan and then I was like oh yeah I need to go home and tell cutie about how I smoke in Japan then I forgot to so then she found out about it from the podcast which is the worst case you tell her huh why you got to tell her you tell you tell you tell your damn girlfriend when you smoke a damn cigarette don't you have a yeah didn't you make up with like a rule you got to tell her when you smoke I got to tell her when I smoke and I broke the rule Aiden BR Ru is she like me where like also if if like somebody I'm dating says like they tell a story and it's like a story I've never heard before and I asked them how their day was that day they never tell me that I'm like kind of annoyed yeah that'd be that I think that's fair of you yeah cuz I'm like man say it again like uh like if I ask a guy that I'm dating like hey how was your day like if he goes to like a football game like how's the game and he goes oh was good and then we're all out with friends oh he tells a story yeah and he tells a crazy story I instantly be like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I asked you that is super reasonable because I think what I think what he's communicating is it's like when you get in the car and you're and like your mom goes like how was school and you go good cuz like I don't want to talk about it right right right whereas if he tells it excitedly later it's like oh I just didn't want to tell you cuz I didn't want to talk to you right but the other way around I think is fine we're like someone like you talked to someone else first told them the story and then they got to you and you're like why' you tell someone else first I think that's fine yeah that's how I normally like that's how I see I feel like cu the same way it's different sometimes cuz sometimes like I stream she streams so she might tell the story on stream or like I might tell the story on stream that's fair it was just like part part of the gig bro I found out my dad got a gun pulled on him from twitch chat what yeah he was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] live and he's telling the story that some lady during road rage pulled a gun on him and like I have never heard this story ever and I'm like live like in the past or was it recent it was from a week ago your dad that's crazy dad your dad dad my dad streams okay is your dad Summit 1G yeah okay no he's actually the doc oh I can't say that sorry no it's just uh like he he was just telling these stories and like it's the fifth time now where he's told a story on stream and like they will come to me and be like oh did you like talk to your dad about this I'm like how the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you talked to him in that past week since he had a gun pulled on him yes and he didn't tell me I bet you said say again he didn't want to worry this is Dad this is Dad [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] wait wait wait this it's definitely not the worrying thing cuz he said it on on stream so it's going to get her he didn't think it get to her he didn't think it get to her crazy he wouldn't make it to her he knows it gets to me cuz he tells some inappropriate stories that make me want to like oh my dad why is your dad streaming he called me one day and he just said he really wanted to try it and I was like who am I to keep him from something he wants to try so I flew out to Virginia and like set it all up for him and like he it's actually really cute he loves it like s of what sort of numbers is your dad pulling on Twitch uh like like 70 to 100 why you God Alex smokes man watch I was going to say I'm curious and we're pulling a gun he got s book bookmarked I think so funny this is we were running um a a melee league for a while this year and at the one of the last ones my dad was in town and came to visit and we commentate the like end of the tournament junior dad me and my dad and it's so I think it's just the my I I think my or like that generation or that demographic is just never present on Twitch like it is so rare to get that type of person so it's like even though the things they are saying are so like normal and and kind of May maybe mundane in like a greater conversational context in twitch everything hits because it's just this type of person is never on streams Boomer's crush on Twitch dude my dad's not even telling mundane stories though you think he'd be like the cute old dad you know that's like oh whatever but he's telling stories about like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] women in our house that like I cuz he's a young dad like he was young so he told a story one time about like this girl that he hooked up with at our house and he was like yeah but like the girls are standing with their grandparents so he didn't know and I get these clips girls Jesus yes so like me my sister and I are hearing these I'm like oh my God that's that's the only nightmare you have to be like one of the only people experiencing this oh probably yeah yeah LeBron oh yeah oh yeah yeah probably only other cowork that but see we bring it like it brings it back cuz like after twitchcon he came to me and he was like oh I'm just I'm so happy like he was like this is one of the greatest things I've ever done he loves it and I was like you know what [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it tell your stories like you're having a time I love it so I'm on the kitchen counter dud he told a story of four women taking their tops off and like and like getting like blacked out drunk in our house you know what I mean and I'm literally he's telling the story despicable I know and he's telling the story and he's like yeah we all got blacked out drunk in the house and like everybody was just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up that part's not good actually that's I'm resending my joke that's not good it was so bad it was bad but it is it's a cute situation sometimes Jen Z is trying to cancel cna's dad my my dad does show like this all the time he called me like it was like I think it was a year ago and he was just like like he's like yeah I'm going in for like my last like uh he's like I got my new car finally I'm like new car what happened to your old car he's like yeah yeah you know remember I was like I was in the hurricane and I'm like no what you didn't mention a hurricane what are you talking about he's like yeah like the big flood where I was like floating on top of my car in like the middle of the street you're like what like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you talking about two weeks two weeks I was there made friends with raccoon people he does this a lot and I'm just like are you lying are you like is is your mind slipping or do this really happen he'll like no this really happened I was in the hospital I Hate Old People bro I hate what's their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] deal they they they they act like they you're supposed to know everything I think this is men not old people no I I was going to say I I feel like I do this I think for whatever reason like the the my my girlfriend tells me I'm bad at tea no you're not you're actually you're a little tea bear you're a tea bear she thinks I'm worse than her apparently oh no she I am bad at te she loves tea more than literally anyone else I know that's Beast I'm I'm losing the tea arms race well yeah I mean but she's like the whole of the UK like you're not you're not on that level I'm anti-t cue hates it about me like you won't talk like gossip ever yeah I don't I I was going to say is a gossiper she's she's she loves tea I know I do too I I know you guys are together in it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tea session yeah it and I come in and it's just like I'm getting water not here for Te I'm anti-os it's true I actually respect that about you cuz it's a it's a natural inclination to want tea but we have to fight against that we have to fight the go fight we have to fight the tea no we have to fight against our like our natural like you want to eat morning Cheetos but you know it's bad for you I don't like seeking out tea but if tea is on the table te on the table like I'm like I would like a cup your it's like your chair slowly gets closer but no one notices and then you're right next to us and you're like okay so yeah but see what you do is worse cuz you just don't partake but you're at the table next to it just kind of listening you know not like I'm not like listening likeing to the people yeah you're still that's dead ass because I've seen him on his phone during really important stuff not paying attention he he's he's able to laser in on that amumu VOD I I like fun te okay like fun te is like your your DMT that's fun cuz but you know what you know the difference to me is is who owns the tea cuz you own that tea where' you get it right that's that's that's ethically sourced teing somebody else's business I don't love I don't love this person said that this person said I don't like the LIF [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I agree cuz it's like it's it's gone through too many I like starting chains like that I like making [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up oh it's so fun to make sh fation I will lie ruin lives

the road I was a very middle of the road guy really I think if you're tall in high school it's really hard to be super low right you already have leg yeah the only reason I thought that is cuz you said the anxiety thing and I only that cancels out I was less socially anxious in high school oh okay the only thing that cancels out tall in high school is running to the lunch line if you run to the lunch line you doesn't matter everything dissolves in front of you turns to Ash I was I was not I was not a popular kid I was just a kid who was uh I would think liked okay like nobody I don't think there were heavy negative opinions about me and I hopped a lot between differentes lot sense yeah I get that there was this guy Jeremy in uh class he pissed me off one day and I started a rumor that he drank his own piss and it it's stuck you're a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he deserved it I swear to be clear like you didn't think the guy who made up the SS branding would lie about other [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] also it was so absurd that was the joke and I was like surely this won't be a thing but then I heard other people talking about it it's like Jeremy like someone made fun of Jeremy that I never talked to for drinking his own piss and I was like I seem to have made an impact here did you ever tell him uh yeah yeah I I I would say it to his face I you you're pissed dude stop talking to me Jesus and what is his rebuttal he was like you're who called me an effler and I was like fair enough my uncle actually bruis his own piss if you want to come over and try yeah we were not cool uh he but he never swung on me so was fine that's nice you hear me now do you know I don't know he wore camo clothes a lot to school so maybe he's hunting a deer okay so he we know who he's voting for this year oh please yeah we know yeah uh sorry what was your other question cuz I oh yeah you like I guess my question is you're a streamer now did you like is this kind of like what you wanted no what did you want to be you want you fell into it I feel like your grind was was pretty intentional cuz what I do is I lower my expectations like astronomically and then I'm like well if this works out that'll be cool as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but if not then whatever and so I wanted to be like an aerospace engineer and I was like that'd be kind of chill riddle say again that's a big aerospace engineer I don't know who the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that is see this is why I'm not an aerospace engineer Arizona oh this guy knows Aerospace this guy knows presc and do you see why I real pres heads yeah I didn't want to work at uh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what is it SpaceX I didn't want to work there cuz Elan yeah yeah but I was like the only thing I wanted to do was I actually five Diablo player top 20 top 20 sorry top 20 not 20 wait he plays he does play Diablo did he stream it on Twitter he just told Joe he's one of the he used to be one of the best Quake players in the world yeah that is awesome it's awesome to lie like that that's crazy that one's you can just prove that one you can't pay someone to play Quake like Diablo well girlies are saying on his on his Diablo account that the amount he'd have to play a day to be there doesn't line up with like the amount of time he actually has I want the Carl Jes video I heard he doesn't do anything for SpaceX though so that's what I heard I heard he's just kind of like a very big figurehead but like he's non hey the girls are jealous cuz he plays Diablo a lot do you think that's what I'm saying though if he's playing Diablo that much there's no way he's the guy figuring out how to catch the rocket out of this guy which is pretty cool he sucks but I think you might just have to give it to him he's the guy naming it like Dave's epic bacon rocket catcher 420 D let's get him in world's greatest o that would hit Diablo W po pop poly Tropic Pop tropical BR if we he came to world's greatest can't say that don't get into cutable

you're going to be the entire time I'm saying it I'm not going to be uh for example like the people I have around me we've all come from like not a lot and so I would love to have a company that I

after not thinking about this man for at least a decade what did you need to know was the context I don't I I don't even know the context I just I Googled William Hung on my phone and then pulled up the Wikipedia article which was funny because when I Googled him again it comes it autofills the search searched it like four pages of purple links
