great for those big warm loads I'm in the warm load I'm having a hard time imagining how that affects the temperature yeah you it's got to just be your body temperature right it's all diet man yeah it's your gut biome oh you need kombucha or you need no kombucha kombucha if you have too much kombucha your your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like Fizzles like acid on that amirth beer yes sir you don't want

Tik Tok assistant zipper 3 delivered me one uh this week it's it's my maybe my favorite she's ever shown me and it's the it's this guy he's with his boyfriend at the grocery store and he's like I need you to say I need you to say hi to my mom like make a nice video for my mom and then his boyfriend is like hey Miss Sanders we're just out we're buying milk at the grocery store just like I'm going to milk your son's thick [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tonight in my mouth and then and then he's like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] man stop [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stop telling my mom this and they do like six takes of him doing like different grocery related bits to his mom about how he's going to come on him keeps going and everyone hits so that's the beauty about you know even though we're in Trump's America which I would say is an outcome we didn't we didn't want uh here on the show well speak for yourself my daily prayer sessions at school are going to be fire they going beol I'm going to lead prayer car talk about AEL at the school you go to we're going to well I'm going to go to the schools to teach him about Cain but also Abel and and what I was going to say at least in our America because we still live in a godamn free country we can [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] milk as much as we godamn want to after prayer what about about during that would be fine could even be welcomed so some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Oklahoma Republican guy like no we can milk in the school it's fine just during dude Oklahoma caught so many Strays this week it had like the screenshot cuz it voted all red blood and then everybody went through just its ranking in our Union of every stat and it's low it's pretty low and and the Oklahomans are just they're just catching stra it's like education 49th Healthcare 50th yeah it's pretty bad you ever hear about this is real you ever hear about how Brett Favre uh stole a bunch of government money I did hear about this can you look it up zipper it's it's just it's really interesting he was the quarterback for the Green Bay Packers he was also in There's Something About Mary with Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz it's important to know as well because he's a football player and he was just in the movie what's he doing there yeah that's like that's actually like when Marshon Lynch just shows up in movies now that's kind of his thing nowes he he just shows up in mov shows up yeah

responding and I know why you've been look we went through this whole thing and don't don't make that face can you go further back that face don't make that face please don't do that face give a little more don't do that face ites stop doing the face you're doing it so far back that it's making me think you might actually not realize you look like a Rage Comic th this is and you know yeah

about you he the only thing he sent me back was that wojack of you is so funny I've been I saved the wojack I used the wojack did you use it all right fine I don't respond what's the issue man what's the issue I think it's because of One Singular thing going on in your life wow it is has to do with a small mummy who is very sad a lot it's legal of Legends it's League of Legends no I was sick were you really dude did you fake being sick you know [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] annoying that do not literally hear it no I don't blood you hear you're playing you're playing off stream do you hear the patina on my voice you don't sound great I got some patina dude what is going on on your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stream dude it's like it it's this layered like hellscape it's normal lwig stream playing League seven games then he'll switch to members only fine but which is also kind of interesting you have a reason I'm sure and then he'll get mad you lost the game I think it was your sixth game ended stream immediately I'm on the league client cuz I've been playing he's in another game off stream yeah what is the what why Cascade this happened with valerant didn't it ski the member streams games with valerant he was like Papa gets one or two and I'm off no he's binging he's binging he's playing into the night and you lost six in a row I did not lose six yesterday you were on fire oh you just lost

Wuhan but yeah okay yeah bad out of Wuhan said that bad out of Wuhan out of this was a dying sick like weird guy uh I've I've made a lot of people start to play League of Legends I actually people were talking about how league is back and I was thinking back as far as I can remember I'm like I think lwig created the Boom I created the Boom for our Circle I want to give some credit just a little bit to Faker just a little bit no give credit to the real guy it wait are you talking about because of Worlds no before that I'll give a little bit of credit to Arcane it's probably part of it yeah go back farther it was me no go back no it's Jesus Christ there is a reason that you are obsessed with hitting plat in in League Tyler W Tyler one no no no no no cuz I was playing League before I saw him I saw that clip of him crashing out on you dude he is unreasonably mean to you it is so funny thank you he is so unreason wait what was it what did you say he see a picture of you see a picture huh oh no uh I said maybe money or something he looked at a picture of you and he was just like look at this piece of disgusting [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like there's nothing not even about League D it's nothing he's just like I hate this guy his chat Exon too cuz he plays a champion called elaoi and then she got nerfed in the most recent patch yeah he someone sends a clip of me losing to this champion and then he goes and he goes these idiots in lll like trying to say like because he [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] goes and he [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] goes and tries to retire and he's standing still and she gets healed and he [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] freaks out and she's getting nerfed because of that zipper go on go on YouTube and type in lwig low why is this that shouldn't come up I want to see we're going to talk about it they should see it it shouldn't come up though dude it's it's pretty uh it's pretty funny so so I started playing it's funny cuz I got placed I plac your Peak yeah he placed your Peak I saw that clip hey but I'm on hey L I'll be on your side real quick purchase ass account well it's not purchase ass account I did not purchase my account you got a purchase ass account no I don't you literally do and you talked about it on this podcast I actually just made this up I don't even know if it's true it is true not true you talked about didn't you need to purchase account to play rank no I played it from a long time ago you talked about it I played in 2011 when my friend tuck on this podcast you talked about how you tried to buy an account that Miles sold you to buy one on eBay and you got scammed no I didn't and then you bought another one on one of those regular sites where you buy accounts and that's how you got it you're making [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up again oh I bet I was wearing all green too see now the thing is you're so good at being indignant about a lie you can't even spell that don't try and I could but I won't but you're so indant about the LIE now I'm starting to think I'm believing that he he bought the count I'm he didn't here I'm a swing voter and I'm going to that side of the room prayer in schools good good economy play no yeah look dude here I've been trying to tell you because I want I begged you to play with me I begged you and then we played a game and we me and lwig try to go play against the tentacle monster we go top it's just like the clip we both died to the tentacle monster tentacle he you he's like I I can't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] play with you I can't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] play with you your opponent are too strong you're too you're too good you're too good your opponent's too strong I can't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] play you it hurt when he said that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out loud when he's like I can't play at your level I was like dude you don't have to say that don't you have to be honest here's here's the facts okay I can't play with slime cuz slime needs to be carried to win a game and I can't do that that's so cruel that is just true oh my God how old were you in 2006 I was like 11 you were 11 I was 16 you know what I was doing in 2006 [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dropping thick ropes on the table in my pants watching nography little nography I was watching we came up with that in the cord the other night nog for short yeah I was watching hen nog and I you know it slow download rates but you know what I was doing I was playing Warcraft 3 DOTA games bro do you understand how long I've been playing the old fashioned way he in the cut he tell me about how we walked to school both [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ways he playing he he was there when when [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Mark Merill shot a man in the streets and made a new game shot that dead in the head I was there no one will know Dr Ranger had a ultimate ability that just gave 15% chance to kill a minion instantly called creeps and DOTA this is old [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all right all I'm saying is I have played these games for so long I don't even get mad I watch you play it's like Val you look at the chat I don't even notice the chat I'm looking at the map bro he's looking like I I my teammates are communicating I don't even notice that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] no no cuz they got PS cuz they got p i I have done all the highs and lows of this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that you are dealing with and then so I'll load up the game learn a champ learn a match up and do well and you're mad at that okay all right and I just want you to know I did not want to just just so you know I did not want to do this today what is it we're pulling up his how zipper do it well yeah it's hard to find that's the issue no no it's really easy he's the only person named Glenn Danzig on the whole entire website Glen Danzig it's not googleable no you can go to this works I promise all right zipper tell tell zipper go to op.gg go to search player for league so okay here's what we're talking about just get we all know about my journey let me just get some context you look to Stats to be validated I'm not looking a stats here I'm just saying I'm trying to have a journey to Plat and and if we're going to bring up a stat he's silver four Peak silver he's silver 470 LP yeah he was silver 3 he's been kind of swinging around swinging around it's it's calibrating I am bronze 2 bronze one stuck there after about 12 hours of playing this past are you bronze 2 or you bronze one I'm bronze one right now okay and don't ever come at me like that again just weird say both well it's a good clarification for the for the fans I was I was more so giving some charitability for people who might say I'm bad and and slime slime placs very high okay because some people people on the left want you to believe he bought his account now would this guy of good character buy an account wait is the left doing the propaganda here with taxpayer dollars it seems unlikely but if he were to then he then he would have his hidden MMR in his normal games that would lead to higher opponents in his matchmaking games which would make him play you're acting like this is an astronaut like I'm getting diamonds BR I placed iron three that's interesting to me that's what a real gamer places when he places all his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's not what a real gamer like real gamer it's what a bad gamer places oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] myself it happens it happens and you got you got gross poop all over here damn it I just dropped thick ropes in my freaking ropes too you suicied the machine you can take my spare you can take my spare spare I've got me I've got meundies on right now and I'll take them off and you wouldn't want to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] those cuz those are nice I ruined my jeans cuz I wasn't wearing underwear you not even wearing underwear I don't have any you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] your jeans I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] my jeans supped to wash them though right you're not suppos when fall comes around each year you probably [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] your jeans too oh oh yeah I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] my jeans in the winter sometimes no you never done it really that's weird though right look they can't promise anything but me undies are very comfortable they're very stretch stretchy breathable the sustainable materials responsibly sourced also I like responsibility yeah they hold your balls in a way that we are unable to maybe maybe the jeans are a little harsh on your skin giving you a little rash we can get you we can get you in some joggers or I didn't know people were underwear we could actually just put you in a brawlet see if you like it I don't know and if you'd like to be in a brawlet or if you've recently [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] your pants uh you can go to meundies.com zipper and get 20% off your first purchase plus shipping at meundies comfort from the outside in oh I can smell it it smells like eggs I I can feel your insides are out first off I want to throw someone else in the Mix Hey present hold hold on and before we take a look at this you you you guys are all on the freak juice I'm in my I'm in my room going to bed I'm like laying in bed and you know what I hear from [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Nick's room I hear the S I hear click click click click click and I also the high pitch sounds of pings and I'm like this guy's been playing league for hours he wants to see everything you what has happened to us look we know why I'm doing all we know why I'm doing it I know what you're doing and you're not doing it very well and then that's the only reason that he got pulled into it and then God forbid I never I never thought this man across from me would get on the juice attacking you and they I thought you would get on the I didn't think you would ever touch the ju grinding normals out and and and you know I had an evil thought yesterday what my you want to hear my evil thought I thought to myself is Nick doing this so he can outrank me no no I don't even play ranked cartoon I can go buy an account and play ranked I want not yet I could buy an account play rank right now no I'm saying but it it wouldn't behoove you what do you mean well right now you're just honing your skills you're trying to see the light oh I'm nice don't get me Twisted with enough time maybe you hone your skills play ranked all of a sudden you rank higher little bro I'm not even thinking about you I got to be real what I'm not even thinking about you bro is it solo qu yeah normal is for fun yeah you're just for there's no trying challenge he's trying to it's also part of yeah partly I I hate sucking at that game in the challenge yeah that's like the actual reason it's practicing for the gamer challenge yeah that would make sense I also I enjoy the game you're so skeptical it's a fun game well cuz nick nick nick nick nick nick nick Nickelodeon lik being better at video games I don't think that's where this is coming from I don't think that's yeah I I know what you're saying but I don't think this is where the Le I've been burned once by people in this room by who By Me Oh sleep for dinner oh is that what you meant I've been burned by him what I do you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] play silver bro I I can't tell you you show me a DOTA screenshot I can tell you what everyone does oh my God who gives a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I have experience to defend him to defend him it is in my experience people who were good at DOTA get good at League very fast have you watched him no this is I'm just saying it looks like there's zero translation that's not that's you're being factious that's not fair mean I it wasn't I'm not wearing green I didn't buy an account he was I understand you're under a lot he's live he's wearing all green and he brother when I tell you he's 0 and five in Lane that is not an exaggeration and five in learning the matchups yeah Darius I'm like what does this guy do here's the thing that's how you get good by by minute 10 you do have to learn play to learn when you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dog [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like Miss two bandages and then Al and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] your so now you're now you're being [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the game ends no You' have some good team fights when the game ends what do you do do you instantly go Q again do you try to learn about the hero that you've never seen before right away okay so what I do is I go and I learn about at least one guy that I've never seen I learn all their abilities and and I all right see because I know that's what you need to do to get good faster all you to do to get better is cu more I I bro I did this with ven I did this with Tekken I have done this too long in moas to go this route just Q again it's it's I'm telling you both wrong and both right it's weird I feel like the way you improve in league is you just limit test like crazy which would just be cute I do limit Testo why would you know cuz I play trying to get better aren't you he just plays video games of course I'm trying to get better I like video games limit testing what is what are you saying if you plays higher than me I'll kill myself in real life with a gun never play ranked I'll just never do it I've been going on like long he doesn't want to hurt in front of everyone you know what intrigues me about League you know like part of why I like it is like okay it sounds like a humble brag but most games I play I rank above the average when I play it but in League I'm looking around all my friends and it's like they're at the some of the lower ranks the game has to offered I'm like what makes this game so hard well it's hard to think of like specific example but like you know you it is crazy I looked I'm in the top 67% that's good that's bad I just want to understand what makes league so hard for a new player or for even for like a seasoned player it's layers of knowledge context mechanics macro micro like it's just a big game there's so much [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] going on I'm learning that by playing yeah and also limit testing is important like you learn the most you learn by attacking and seeing what you can do feeling figing out your range dying a lot and that and so when I go 05 in Lane I'm not freaking out I'm I'm actually winning this game's well no I'm losing but like I'm like this game's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] over this game [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] over I'll yell at chat but I will never yell at the game because I know the game is not the problem my teammates are terrorists not in my backyard you chat so much it's crazy I went to high school with Baron Nasher he got [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fat dude dude Tom kench's mom died yeah he got [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fat later also got Fone me I docks them I don't care Tom Ken bar Nasher Philip Hugh they were all there I uh well I that's why I play offline I get more tilted online why because you got back I don't know if I buy that it no it's well if I'm offline but offline you get nothing from it it's like a pure waste of time what do you mean I get like on stream it's like viewers and money and I'm doing my job but off stream you lose and get you feed like it's no no value I know but I I don't feed offline oh you don't Fe offline when I play offline zipper please your honor I would love but you know how it's insane to say I don't offine differ then that means you have actually in L's defense I have like an 85 offline big a big defensive lwig coming in you ready for this L it's going to feel good yeah if you look at how each of you place compared to your teammates in your games on each of your op J GS you're very low on your team and you're very high on your team yeah most I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm a I'm a damn leader you know what it says next to my name Aiden leader I don't know what that means what is a do you play jungle yeah what what is like a high CS per minute for Jungle it what's consider good at like depend on the CH but like for like a really good player I think they're in the sevens touching eights okay H but broa gets 10 plus mid be mid like like like mid like mid mid like fiveish no sorry I me like mid lane mid lane you can get like like8 to 10 yeah okay laners can get eight to 10 some laners volar top if he's against a range champ it's going to be a little tough it's going to be a little tough I you know what so I I had a I had a I had a moment of vulnerability on stream okay and I was like maybe I quit this challenge no who said what why did you think that cuz pl's far it is far it is so far what was the other challenge oh was the marathon one you were like maybe I quit this is the second second version of this feeling remember the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] was that rning running a marathon he's talking about I'm saying we' had this conversation before I know I know how you're feeling bro bringing why don't I oh bro bringing up your L's like do this got a good I've got a good strategy what if you played one more minute of League every day that's fire yeah and it and your shin will heal yeah and Shake drizzle will do it too and then Shake will do it can you go to YouTube zipper and go to the channel CeX CA X CeX live I have a hero a hero what's what is the rags to riches well every grade what's that story where it's like a the Hero Journey the hero's journey the story what's thato Journey go to community the hero's journey needs a uh a Sensei if you will and if you zoom in and read this it says saw lwig sad and wanting to quit the challenge so I'm going to go over his most recent fiddle jungle game to give him some tips to climb overall with fiddle specifically you don't play and then well no no it's my this my this is my two but he look at his jump bro uh yeah C oh my God I know wait how is that even possible I don't know bad [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] alert he had a 90% win rate with fiddle sticks 90 that's insane that's one season apart he jumped from Silver one to master in a season he went crazy was doing tricks on now he's Challenger with fiddle top well you could go nasty bananas like this guy uh that's my plan all right all right uh look man I never quit or kill yourself never sorry never quit and never kill yourself never quit never quit or kill yourself kill yourself question mark my reply to Archie he wrot he wrote never kill yourself as a picture of him watching my league gameplay with some horrible British food yeah and I wrot in a red Fanta and I just rep pour up syrup dude I think I think they uh imported that that's like that's like that's like getting the um the zins the EU to be able that's Contraband for sure that's Contraband they're firebombing you know that's what happening in Australia they were firebombing smoke shops cuz the compet blackm competition and YouTubers and YouTubers love firebombing really in Australia they still have guns they just got Fire Bomb never hurt nobody this is all to say league has invaded Our Lives you in particular um and we'll see how this shakes out cuz people are very interested in my journey if only for the Shaden cloud of watching me MOG you which I think is kind of funny but also I defend you going to just glaze over that I don't know I don't know enough about that word he's watching a German YouTuber I he is he told us about it yeah the making a this is a normal word it is not a normal word everyone says this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you weirdo dude everyone knows about this everybody knows about this zipper can't find [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] half the time and he finds this one and he smells it perfectly sh this is the Slime Gaslight episode and you know what the feeling of pleasure or satisfaction that comes from witnessing someone else's Misfortune whoa that's dark it would be a German word too it's also crazy you're trying to defend that everyone knows this I I've never heard this did that I am very surprised I'm not kidding uh so I'm I I I in streaming it's been really fun I like the bear but I got a lux skin I got a bear skin I got the I got the cop one and I realized he was a cop and I'm like I don't like this well no cuz then he puts the sirens on when he runs it you I don't like that what I wanted to say is if I end up aab except VI feel if I end up hitting plat before you yep yep Jesus Christ if I end up hitting plat before you will you be upset uh no who what if I do it pull it through the skull why what's the difference um I don't want to say it no I don't I don't want to say no lay it on me lay it on him lay it on me cuz I think one of you can do it what does that mean I don't want to expand all right I won't let you expand peace Slayer 69 shod and Freud I can't believe you never heard that word I wish I could be funny about it but I'm Blown Away I've been with Chad and Freud there you go let's go I hope that you guys all come back to me one day that you leave this why don't you hop in the wat's warm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you played a bit play a bit dude we' have so much fun if we queed we would not have fun if we no I have fun with you hm we'd have fun we'd have more fun than if we CED you know a really sad thing that we did the other night we both were playing League of Legends in the same Discord call just not together we were just Solo queuing in a call at the same time were you talking yeah yeah that's true it was just funny because it was like we could very easily just play together could just du yeah yeah I think uh I think you know I got my taste last month I played a couple games I got one game where I carried harder than Shake did and Shake's good at League of Legends and I was like that's funny and then I'm done what rank is he right now well pull it up zipper cuz he was one game away from plat last night and I know he was playing a game at 3:00 a.m. when I was in bed and I saw it on Discord I haven't had an edit in six months one in the vein of playing like having a solo queue and like you know being in the same call and solo queing and being a different Gam games I think one thing that sucks a lot about League that I think would have sucked me in if it was available was if you could just five stack like you can in valerent and I get that there's like some culture with the within the game that like separates solo Duo and like people who are like hardcore into it prefer that but I think the the experience of watching friends like have to play in different groups or Duos and like not getting to play together sucks so bad like I want to play the real 5v5 game with people trying together talking and I feel like solo que is like such a watered down experience of what makes League fun yeah it's a go next simulator yeah yeah a quick congrats Shake drizzle is the first one to hit plat you see him lose one he's just like all right give me I'll give me no no he he's 94 LP so that he he got plat three actually let's go he went for plat he was last night he was gold for and he he played enough to get to to Plat three yeah he's been playing like 14 games he's just jamming carus this one trick and his carus has a great win rate but anyway he uh he's the first everyone's trying to do it which is also stressing me out a bit cuz Stans I don't know if you saw he did a 48 hour stream I see yeah he started out 13 and two holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and then ended 24 in like 22 wow systems Riot got back there system works Riot I genuinely think is filled with terrorists wow turns out turns out when it happens to you when it's it's like Joe Rogan be like turn out voting works that a crazy clip that was crazy and this is you doing the same thing I was trying to say I was trying to say it this whole time hey you've been right for years they're terrorists they are filled to the brim they're it's a damn cell I don't know what marks feeding them terrorist juice yeah feeding them different weapons well if you think about the origin of the company that's right killed them man K in broad daylight what do we do man are we just going to be in this hole until the season's over yeah till January 6th yeah that's when it ends does it really yeah that's crazy well because there's things that Libs got to do on the sixth and we know who runs this we're busy that day why is a riot we're to show with oat milk and little bar cards for mobile coffee yeah it be very organized I can't wait to sing my favorite Hamilton song at the capital it's going to be really fun going to ask for consent to come in it's all right no it's all good no that's fine we'll just be be out here just it we thought it'd be good to be here though I don't know I think League's fine man I I think I have a healthy relationship with it you know what it is fine Nick as long as you're hitting back the group chat okay you're M I was literally sick do I get sick days that's not you can't sick days you can't say I was sick and then just stream boot you're doing the job doing responding takes less energy than I disagree with all this is what I this is my issue you can have a sick day but you got to come into the the chat you have to remember you had to shoot and you have to be like hey guys I'm sick I got to push the shoot instead of going that's kind of early instead of ignoring my 9:00 a.m. message until 9900 p.m. and saying can we push the whole damn was that 12 hour 6 s uh what about what about what about changing my Discord profile picture to a version of me that's sick or sad yeah a thermometer really red yeah and then you know like oh he's sick the problem is you wouldn't remember to do that the problem is you would forget to change it back and we would always think we have to ask is the profile picture accurate and then you wouldn't respond and so the systems collapsed it's like my sign I used to have a signature in my email forgot to take it off yeah like Forum post what was it uh I think it was ly o31 you would sign emails as that hyphen Leto 31 who were you emailing you felt that was appropriate we used to do so many emails me and all my classmates really oh you're emailing your classmates yeah my classmates and they knew you as l31 well I would throw my gamertag in yeah them to know what my achievements were if I said this you guys would crucify me I we would email back and forth like like oh you got spooked say this to 10 other people or you have seven years of bad luck you not texting this is no

[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up too I was on the toilet and I was on Robin Hood Robin Hood's been trying to entice me lately I don't know if you saw this for a period they had betting for the election oh yeah you on Robin Hood open the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] app in front and center it would say it have Hala and Trump and you would bet on it and it would have odds that seems like it's not allowed I it was crazy to me cuz they figured it out I'm like this shouldn't technically it was like buying I think some crypto that represented I don't know exactly how it worked wow but but uh yeah they had betting up front center and so then you know they they've been slowly enticing me to do [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's not just buy big company stock that I like and so I did an options play cuz right after the election stocks went Skyhigh sure none higher than Tesla not because they've come out with new invention or automatic driving but it's just people speculatively investing in Elon oh good yeah uh as it should be I guess in day one after he won he went up like 15% some something crazy and I was like I was like and I didn't really know what an options play was and it was like it's selling for like three 05 or some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a share I'm like all right options Play 2 weeks 280 250 and it was like you could stand to gain 300,000 you could stand to lose, 1500 I'm like cool with me yeah sure that's a great deal yeah and uh and anyway now I get updates from Robin Hood every day and it's like bad news dot dot dot and it's just it's still going up can you look up Tesla right now look at Tesla stock it is bad rope Emoji chair Emoji don't open the app today maybe keep us closed yeah actually it's bad I'm on I'm on mgin Hood what is that oh it's yeah oh wow yeah it is up 41% in the past 5 days okay

breakfast every we have one down here have you tried it dude it's been on it's been sitting on a table outside of refrigeration for likeold bro it's really it looks it's growing a colony in there yeah it's going to grow another lunch leet how they spawn yeah you're you're changing up on us you got the lunch League you're making options plays and you're playing league and not not responding you're turning full right wing because of League 100% it seems like it yeah I have no trust in my fellow man I hate my teammates I hate my enemies so the the amount of Donald Trump Maga clan tags in Call of Duty is skyrocketing oh I'm sure they're all over Le it's a huge buy right now on the clan really I haven't seen that I booted into a game and the first thing someone typed is damn can't believe people voted for that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I was like that's crazy the first word you said yeah it's it's you you realize how are no no no they meant they meant uh Gala yeah and then uh it was a Fiora she went 10 and0 Carri the game single-handedly I was like magga yeah he got me dude I there's a lot of racist names on that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] too I'm like damn I forgot the screenshot Nick Nick the one in Nick's game was insane nickon a screenshot I don't know what he's trying to show I was trying to show my statline I was like I'm not that I'm not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] anymore he had a decent stat line and then instead what we all see is the incredibly racist name that he had just missed dude I didn't even notice it until you guys pointed it out I think I have like the brain filter because of cod where like every name is like that right dude I'm not kidding every name is like that in COD it's so bad yeah yeah we'll be all right we'll be all right you sound like you're not going to be all right yeah you I actually agree with you I think we'll be all right but you sound like that you're not going to be all right why you got dog print jibbit bro you don't even have a dog I do have a dog come on not much it's not really your cutie said that Swift she would never admit Swift belongs to you it's our dog oh no that's our dog dude are you kidding me I am Swift's second favorite person on Earth what else will you take yeah but the Gap is he there's second in everything I mean yeah bro look it's like uge it's Kobe andw brown or whatever it's like the tournament pays out only to first place I think in this one uh it's it's it's we both are loved by Swift I don't think that's true this is true I don't think Swift knows you he knows he gets excited when I get home gets scared when you get home bro he do not get home and you got a hat on if I'm wearing a hat he's a little bit barks yeah he hates people with hats at 12 had a hat he came on I was like ah he doesn't like that he's like what like Muslim people I was like no man not people hat I think I think he doesn't like it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for a different reason no dude is that hat oh could be the same racist I think he does it's the Hat racist dog he is also racist for sure but he hates hats more that's kind of sweet is it we should get Swift a little Trump hat funny no make kibble great again or some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] no no if Swift look dead ass if I if I go to your house Swifts wear an old Trump hat I'm blowing his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] off smooth I don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you're going to kill the dog yeah [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't care you kill the owner put the Hat on the dog no what are you cop the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is that shoot first shoot first collect the meat later my God I think Swift would happily eat you if cutie gave permission no he'd be too scared he would no no he if you if you ke over died in the house he'd eat your ass first cuz it's dude when you get home you should take one of those videos where like you act like you die in front of your pets and see what they do I bet I bet Swift the way I bet Swift just madebe pisses on you dude the other day we're me and cue are home she's just working on streamer rewards I'm downstairs watching the Patriots and Swift starts howling which is what he does when she's not home and I'm like I'm like bro and then I like I get cutie and then she like knocks through like a like a like a glass door and then he looks looks up and he freaks out he didn't even realize she was home he was just he got sad cuz he hadn't seen her in a few minutes God he's so stupid I think I think okay this is what I was thinking the other day if he was a human is it fully platonic you think his love for his owner ooh like do animals only platonically love their owners I don't think Swift wants to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] your girlfriend is what is if you're asking you sure it's probably a very similar love to like a child than a parent and they're the child they're yeah no that's how we IM that's how we imagine it yeah do you imagine it you think it's romantic well we know CS wanted to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me that's true it's no wait wait this is rewriting history no it was the other way around she actually liked me what no how convenient we almost let you rewrite history she's just one of my damn Instagram stories not rewriting [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] history I did not want to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] my cat well did you said you cat wanted to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you so what are we doing telling the truth I guess this is this is the least amount of Truth we've ever told on his damn talking about it CS can't speak You're The One putting this out there it's getting a little chilly this time of year I'll wait I'll wait for sweetheart no

our break what the dog's got stinky pee he does not got stinky when we got swatted he pissed all over my leg and I was in the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cop car you got swatted you can't let a dog piss on your leg you know when you know when it was stinky SWAT the cops were like or people eating asparagus in this household the fairmon it was so gross you know lizard lizards will do that that thing where they like ejaculate piss and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and and in in a moment of fear and then and it's supposed to get rid of like the thing that the Predator that's snatching them up that's what Swift does with his PE I'm sorry you're telling me lizards come on their pred their Prat they come out they come out of fear but it's not it's not just and what is the Predator doing like oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the Predator is like d [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nasty I don't want to eat yeah it has little skulls coming out of it like ghost flame and ring that's what's coming out as Swift's penis dude it's a normal piss no it's definitely not listen Swift has normal pee and he has scared pee he had scared pee when he pissed all over Aiden when he was watching him and he had scared pee when we got swatted and cutie was like can you put him in the kennel I'm like okay I tried to grab him he pissed on my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ankle then they put us in the cop car and it smelled that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stunk it stunk like I was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a are three petless men trying to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tell me what a dog's like y'all you have a pet hm no cuz [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you don't have a dog you would die when you go to the f a dog I do have a dog that dog is it your dog if if you Dro dead he would just get confused and then howl he would shed a tear no you would shed a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] already been there you think you'd shed a tear for you yes he you know what's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is you don't have a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pet you don't know I don't and if you did it would [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] die it would die [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] die Ares from only forget about it only eating Awan groceries me i' feed it Awan groceries Awan dog food you'd be gone a year for 3 weeks and start eating the floor yeah and I'd come back and and it be be dead like my puffles and Club Penguin oops forgot all right yours would die no I'd love mine yours would die from the heater it would burn I don't have a heater anymore I have an electric blanket Checkmate atheist it would be smothered pirate that's fine that's fine fine that's game that's game as long as it dies and Nick could take care of one but won't well he feels more hurtful than all the others is it not true I would I would love it to death you won't cuz talking about get a dog get one he he has often said I I don't want a dog cuz it'll die one day and he doesn't want to be sad he said that that's my biggest reason I my dog that's so dumb no yeah you're dumb no yeah this is dumb no i' had I've had dogs and every time they die I'm depressed for like a year yeah but the joy you got is equivalent no uh yeah maybe like why are you sad cuz the dog's dead yeah why are you sad oh he's trying to say cuz it once lived the loving relationship because the amount of joy you had is lost but you have the amount of Joy if it dies that is mathematically makes sense to me I like it's you have to be sad to have been once happy now all right man you're saying it's robotic I'm saying it's human it is human I been thinking about getting small little pup small little pup the only way to get a dog would be if I could take it everywhere cuz I I leave the house a lot so I got to have my dog with me all the time no this is you then you become a part of the problem I hate this what what's wrong with the dog's coming around I hate it's people bring their dogs too many places in oh my God you're just like your rotten girlfriend you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Nim she's so right about this dude we were we were at we we're at a movie theater we went to go see uh conclave the the movie about picking the Pope and the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] person in front of us has their dog at the AMC big distinction yeah you have to be honest yeah was it loud it wasn't loud then who [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cares why does it have to be there what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is is crazy you're just mad you're actually a nimi no you're just mad dog imagine sh imagine you have a dog and you want to go see a movie but you can't find anyone to watch your dog you be like gu I can't go see a movie that's the price of getting the dog that is so that's the social price of getting the dog well trained behaved dog that will not be loud and also kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with some Tarantino then take it to the movies problematically by the way but you talk to later about that yeah just like what about I can't believe I'm right a cafe okay and people bring their dogs to the cafe yeah and then the dog [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you know one thing that I don't like is when somebody has their dog they're laying on the the dog's on the ground it's chilling it's not bothering anybody but then other people walk by with their dogs and then the dogs [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] get up and they bark and they fight and that happens repeatedly all the time piss off soath get a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] get a goddamn badge and shoot it in the head if you're just pissed off about it join the police department it takes 4 seconds yeah it is easy it is easy and then I'd have the goddamn right what about when someone has their dog in public and everyone who walks by gets their whole day made better cuz they saw a dog today true that happens more wait okay so am I the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] because me and cutie go on a walk with our dog our dog going on a walk with your dog is fine pause and then we go to a coffee shop yeah with the dog with the dog why you leave the dog outside [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tied to a pole it'll see a big car and run at it and I'll never see it again what do you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mean know Swift tied to a PO what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do you think happens if I what he's saying is then don't go outside with [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Swift that's the price of having yeah put you come back swi is God forbid Swift gets some exposure therapy so he becomes a functioning dog find a way to himself off that pole yeah so suppressed it's bad within minutes of leaving him there what a crazy take so you rather bring the dog why do the dogs have to come into the stores cuz they're allowed in the stores Aiden cuz the stores allow it what about people who are okay what about this what about this how about this how about you go to a store Trader Joe's the other week Trader Joe's the other week someone has their big ass dog and Trad dogs zipper look up dog hoing up hopping up on the counter at the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what why does the F person checking you out have to deal with your dog why are they obligating first they weren't checking you out they were probably just doing their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] job second off if they're allowed in the store what do you think meant by checking out thought they were looking you up pause pause you know what you get it on dogs are not allowed in Trader Joe's actually get service animals the the okay the problem also the service animal cheese is insane this makes a ton of sense probably because of uh wait service animals are is not cheese no people people who don't need service animals sign their dogs up to be service animals so they can take them whenever I've met I've met like five people who have done this this ain't a real thing it literally is surfice animals are hardworking citizens surface animals can get this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dog I just think I just think people's dogs don't need to be everywhere all the time and I it's a very La thing a very La thing why he's bringing it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] everywhere that's fine oh he can have a big stick in public and I'm not allowed to have one why can't I have a big stick why your glasses so obviously fine it's night time sunglasses off why can't Swift why can't Swift just wait outside the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] coffee shop what's more annoying what's more annoying to you someone having a dog a dog being in a coffee shop quietly on the floor or an owner who's only purchased a coffee being there for nine hours on a laptop to me personally yeah [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the dog I don't know I don't have to interact with the guy on his laptop crazy guy takes up a whole table all day almost nothing object permanence is not there if it's a cute Swift's a cute dog yeah I know Swift too well been through too much anymore yeah what what what what I what do you want me to say about Swift I'm saying like you're in a coffee shop and you see Swift you're not happier he doesn't add to the on if I have no history with Swiss no history no history he's just a Floy on the street not really not girl has this is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up is this is this comes from his girl she hates dogs is that crazy this is animals they eat babies the part that I've always hated is when somebody brings their dog in a public place and then the dog is intrusive or barade do you hate babies on planes of course I mean me too but what what you're saying is you are mad at the concept of the dog being potentially a problem even if the dog is chill and that seems we call Prejudice not all dogs towards dogs yeah not all dogs are bad yeah yeah but sometimes to the coffee shops they're not bringing the best I think I I think you could just leave the dog outside or at home could putall it is so much more to divide Us in the dogs it's so much more work to just tie your dog up outside leave them unattended go and get your coffee and that's more work yeah yeah because you have to like do it you have the leash and moderate and monitor your poorly trained dog inside this is crazy you did add that as a as a dog owner here this is actually last example cuz you're right you're right AMC movie dog that didn't bother me the whole time I was just like I think it's insane to bring your dog because you don't bet they were talking sh czy you don't know if your dog is just going to be chilled the whole time I feel like you don't know people will be like will meet someone who wrongs him deeply and be like yeah that's fine that's fine but then a dog is in a movie Fe her and it's like well we should kill it somebody somebody brought their dog somebody brought their dog is c yeah people this is fine if people actually need it I'm just saying that people abuse the system of service dogs what a blind person and the dog is like tapping what's happening on the screen is that wrong if the dog is putting in the McDonald's order do do you find this to be a problem these the type of issues like Republicans bring up to distract from like normal issues like educ many abusing the service dog system you're right you're right we're abusing the service talk system and don't think about any of the it's bureaucracy and it must be the dogs are making the kids I I was on a really long flight and someone had their dog in the carrier below the seat in front of them and they were sitting to my left their dog smelled like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so I had to smell their dog smelling like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the whole flight Aiden when he gets off the plane looking at the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on his pants do you do you think that they should have just thugged it out and not gone wherever they were going to go they should have flown private yeah they should have they should have jss if they actually cared when they purchased the dog they consider going on flights if your dog has to come first of all you can just put your dog in like down I really thought he's going to say know you can just keep your dog you can keep your dog in a carrier in the other [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] part of the plane can't you no this is an indictment of the owner not the dog I think that I I agree that if you have a annoying dog in public it's really loud and barking it smells terrible in a small space then the owner should have either trained it or so many a dogs are dog the dog it doesn't make the dogs that are well behaved also a problem I'm not here to put the dogs on trial I'm going to shoot the dog or I'll [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] talk to the owner I I'm I'm going to do May the own SM like dog Maybe the owner smell like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dude this is an interesting development in your uh in your life let me go to other C when you go to other cities in the world aren't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] there aren't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are we talking about in [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] weird West Coast American cities that people have their dogs New York City in New York City not as as Los Angeles I don't think all you just like places where your house doesn't have a backyard thisy this is all is happen tell us about Sweden is that people who don't have backyards don't really have dogs in spheres we shoot your dog in spheres there are no dogs thank God in spheres we make it then we crucify every dog like Jesus I just don't think your dog needs kill them and for what it's worth Swift stays at home most of the time great fcking monitor on you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you're hella racist I'm not racist it's speciest if anything oh that's better is better when we're multiplanetary it's yard that dog's going sh yard my front yard's fire i' [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'd eat your dog i' cook and eat your dog you would not you smoke it would taste rank thing is you have to get through his owner talking about myself [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we were talking about [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] owner you're not the owner we are both owners of that dog no if she God forbid is confined to a bed for the rest of her days I have to take care of the dog for the rest of his days I have a question L yeah how long do you think until you're better than cutie at League I would not like to answer this question you answer it you answer while you answer you answer I don't want to answer just answer the question tomatoes and oranges yeah yeah we could probably rank those easily if we wanted to she play more she plays ADC I don't think I could ever be better than her really yeah ever well it's like just could Jes maybe we' made better buildings but bro she I I I was streaming that game I place into silver she comes into chat I've never heard her talk to me like that she crashed out it was crazy I will tell you when we had breakfast the next day and I said that you bought your account it was like that Chris Pratt like Avengers it like zoomed in on R you and what this is a lie it is not a li what what is this fars you trying what rank is she she's not really she not she's not in a rank phase right now she's in between ranks she's the idea she was a gold player like somewhat for sure played like a gold player at one point yeah like that's the meanest thing you ever said was that she was she play yeah she played like a gold player for sure she's gonna listen to this everything we've said today she's going to hate so you got to understand ADC is a very hard role right now the skill ceiling is very low they're just CU they're so squishy it's a tank meta so I mean like you get a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] uder who's level 18 G so it's like there's brain dead Champions like Voli and and uder and you know but B's not brain dead well it's not really thoughtful is it God bro or do you think you're playing very thoughtfully I do do you think you just hit the r where there's a lot of people and dive in you don't even know what his R does he jump he goes what else does it do [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it it makes a little Tremor it makes everyone quake and quiver it disables towers for two seconds everyone's veins disabl towers for two seconds I want to disable but you didn't know that and this B bear was going to hop on you in some game you're under tower Tower doesn't shoot be why why does they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] get to do that cuz you didn't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] read stuck well let's let that part sink in cuz I think it's a learning moment Aiden wants to kill all dogs so minus two yeah you're a cop bro that is true you're turning into is one of those cop likee features yeah bro you're a cop for that I think uh stand on that I literally I literally love them too much I got a cathartic story for you Aiden cuz I saw a dog owner get banned from flying United Airlines uh on my flight she was she there it was AC cross cross aisle from me this lady had her dog and a carrier yeah and whole flight I don't notice this dogs there great Pooch didn't do do didn't

pokes his head out little pup go it's one of those dogs that like just look like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] m one of those tiny dogs smell like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in here smell like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what that smell like that smell like uh and uh and I'm like a cute dog and the flight attendant comes over and she's like you cannot have your dog out and then the lady was like I'm just trying to like let him breathe and they have like a back and forth and then she like fake puts them away yeah I love that dog still out she comes back she goes you're going to stay on the plane till everyone deanes oh my God and I'm like I'm like and then she starts to fight back and she's like she's like do you want to keep going and and they have a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] little cat off about the dog that's crazy and you know who wins the cat offs the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the government always always wait did she get removed uh she had to stay till the very end and then I think they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] wrote her up or some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't know how it works in plane world oh my God she got Saturday school yeah yeah she had to take a plane on Saturday yeah just fly around the circle you be on it the whole time got to write your name a bunch yeah I will say some dog owners get real [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] weird at the end of the day they're like hey put him in the goddamn thing and you're like okay fine I want to protect my dog it should be about protecting I feel like our fur babies should be able to do what they want I think my fur baby should be able to have a puppuccino now um the puppuccino is free right I'll take three dude you want to you want to get liberals over the line to the Republican side start charging for pueto they'll lose their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they'll they'll start freaking the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out was I got irrationally mad at a video it was this guy he's like check out this hack and he's at a coffee shop and he's like can I have an espresso and they get him one and he's like can you put a little milk in and she's like sure and he's like more and she's like okay and he does it until it's filled and he's like latte is a latte I was like this is so mean yeah it's it's like the uh the Chipotle hack you film them to make sure yeah that's which is cringe bro like they're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] shoveling meat on on Torch more meat for me little more meat let let a guy behind the counter Tak your balls out cuz the video is being taken it's like okay I'll give you double meat but you're getting double meat are you okay with that what's that what is this what is that card is this like the Adam Sandler free Subway for life from Happy Gilmore card let me see flash this card and receive one free Entree at any Chipotle location in North America up to three modifiers included may corre your charge you can use this card up to once per day on each of up to 50 days prior this is this is wait an apple card why do you why do rich people get free food you don't deserve this pay for it how did you get this uh I don't know being [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] awesome QR code hey hey hey arrest that man sorry he's not a dog I can't shoot him in the head I want to make sure it's scanned it does um Nick you're allowed to use episode 10 meals because I've bought so many movies on your Amazon account oo actually no I rented them actually but it's expensive I have rented a lot of movies on Nick's account someone's got to do it someone's got to do it you know what I got him back I got him back because my PlayStation 5 is still linked to The Old Company card that's worse that's worse is that why we have is it not your PlayStation description it's not mine dude I was doing an exp I've been doing an expense on it it's pretty solid it's a solid car it's metal I'll give you though it's metal I'm canceling PlayStation today I'll give you though whoa come on uh it's an expense you play video games I see Aiden go through with Yingling the uh like expenses and he's trying to just separate any personal stuff and I'm just seeing all my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fun [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] get cut down he's like YouTube TV that doesn't count cut it yes it does why would that be a business expense because he's a YouTube streamer man he's bad at this I hooked you up business I always did and I always my man SL me up this is no this is the mentality when somebody's like no no cuz it's a if it's an expense you can you can write it off and you know what's better than writing off the expense not having the expense at all sure but but he likes it but I'm going to have to pay with my own money now yeah stupid no then you're wrong now cuz he's already going to use his money that's freaking stupid if he likes it there's a way easily write this off his research yeah easily well doc lwig salary then you're do my salary fine we'll dock his we'll dock his salary salary got I love owning lwig in many ways but this again it's just wrong no I wasn't wearing green this is an expense well don't pack that in cuz that one's probably not going to I'm going to he's gonna oh she's gonna what she's gonna what she gonna what now just call her you doing to her what aen is doing to dogs I I just damn might it's bad just damn might no cuz it's he he it can't come out of the company account anymore cuz we need to save money how much money is it that I think like 90 a month oh 0 a month yoube TV is expensive that's pretty really expensive you can still write it off though it's it's definitely above 70 I I think it is literally like $69.99 and then I have the NFL Sunday Ticket for like an extra 100 month wa it is more it is more we need to get expens I love football dude we this is let's go Patriots let's go there's some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in this company account that we used to use we used to use Shopify you know to do stuff a long time ago there's a Shopify business subscription for $400 a month takes a bite I just learned about this they take a bite and I I'm doing me and Ying are going through expenses we're doing a little audit and I'm like wow why do we pay this $400 a month for Shopify I thought we canel that two years ago and I was like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] maybe I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this up maybe this is a mistake that I have made and I go and look and I'm like no wait our Shopify account did get canceled two years ago so what's this it's a like this is the Shopify account that lwig was using to like fulfill merch out of his garage years ago and it's still charging $400 a month since then and no one has ever no one has ever looked at this charge and and cancelled it yeah when I had stopped doing that I was not looking at it I thought we were still using Shopify so I was like yeah it seems good not my fault and so we're getting rid of the YouTube TVs and and the Playstation Networks I'm down with that one we're making Cuts we all have to suffer yeah some of us more than others mostly Shopify suffering here I got 31 bucks 31 bucks from X the everything app really yeah for what just like total cuz you have posting I guess yeah yeah that's so little dude you get 31 $31 from posting on X X everything app it's a great place to post things that you think you got good delivery bro I always said that about you I bet you could like figure out like it's it's probably really easy to figure out what your time is valued at like your like the amount of like you know what is one hour of L's life worth and how much you can make and then you can figure out how much you got to tweet yeah to make as much as you're worth in an hour and then tweeting becomes not a waste of time for you and we could raw we could raw Cal how much money is being lost when you play league offline oh that's a that's a dark calculation Who whoo whoa whoa offline we're not we're not losing money League offline online League streams that's television that's that's just work does work d i I'm sorry what what is this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] terrorist Nation where I can't get a couple for me couple for you they should all be for you I give I give seven of the people online I give five to the members online is three and I give a couple to me do you think you get do you think you get sniped 14 G of course I get sniped Ah that's what up of course I get I'm I when I'm playing League I'm the number one League streamer that's crazy put her there yeah doctor is that true yes I guess you're live with like 20K okay no I was live with like 15K in my league game but that's number one the League's not a huge category I mean the bouss will hit 17K kadr when he's live but he hasn't been live in like a couple weeks I don't know this is accurate cuz I'm not exactly sure how the tool works but I'm working on some stuff for streamer Awards and uh I had to use this like document they have of like all the biggest clips from the year and this is like twitch Clips not like re-uploaded to YouTube clips like twitch clips and I I they had like a tool to like look up like every it looked what what seemed like every clip on Twitch and I sorted by most viewed all year you know what number three was ponet slime the the valerant clip where you tell them your age it said it was the third most viewed how many views it was like a quarter million oh my God that's mogged or like 300K or something mogged that's I mean sorting from January 1st of this year an only viewership on the clip link yeah maybe that's right uhoh I was like that's Happy learned how to putt it's crazy I I think uh well I think it's misleading why is that no it's just it's honestly it's just that's the metric for that site for that link like well I think like Clips are not viewed through the clip viewer on Twitch for the most part viewed on reuploads right they're viewed on reuploads on Twitter or yeah yeah I don't think he's the most viewed clip in the year I think he's the most most viewed twitch thir third most view the year you're not the third most CLI went crazy that's what it says his clip went crazy on on a it did it no it kind of did on my Twitter but but on lsf okay yeah does it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you up that I kind of got it like that no I actually love when you got it like that I love when you got it like that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me up when your silver 4 that's it I think both of first two were valerant Clips yeah this sounds wrong I think this is wrong cuz I'm almost positive I remember a twitch clip of Kai with maybe Kevin Hart getting like I feel like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that would be like more [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that has happened than I was skeptical too I was like I wonder yeah but it was like here's how you view the most viewed twitch Clips in the past year you go to live stream fail sort by top sort by year and then just click on them it's those ones yeah cuz that's where those are that's the only reason I has a mill is cuz of that live stream fail uh you what can you sort by one year yeah you go by top you go by past year uh no that's cuz that's there's no way for twitch Clips to get views like they added a way to do it no I don't think a soul uses it part of part of it would be also that happened in January so it has had some of the most time a lot of time to incubate a lot of incubation time a lot of people wanted to see me a lot of people want to see you they want to see you now they want don't don't back out join the Laughing bit can I ask you something chubin uh why when I type in chat you don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] acknowledge me I don't read chat yes you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do well you Ty I don't why the hell all right now go to the yeah this is good this keep scrolling this is fine right that one says 5 days ago I don't think it refreshed no this that was just a uploaded clip just yeah yeah asmin banned on Twitch it did it refresh no it didn't refresh these are this is not in chronological order it's almost certainly refresh go relevant stop oh no no this is this is this is right folks I don't know why we're being weird about it now just go to the first twitch clip five days ago so find a clip on Twitch yep and then click that sure that and then see the views on that guy him reacting to asmin getting banned nmp reacting yeah what's the views uh 600 652 oh maybe not okay I've been mugged wow yeah I don't get how it works uh yeah I think that would be more indicative of most viewed oh wait what last month I wonder if I even sorted it to yeah maybe sorted it why don't you acknowledge me bro what do you mean I I'll be typing in chat I'll be like what you talking about up Spaghetti O so tired whenever you pop in chat I get excited I'm happy that you're there when Nick pops in and says some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm happy that he's there you never show up you don't even come you hate dogs here's the thing here's the you hate dogs he said kill all dogs on an ALT you ever see those videos it's like like oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with our friend at work and it's a guy who works at like Starbucks and then they show up and they get like R do this and they're let me get 100 cappucino do not act like you are a Starbucks work and he's like what's what's the name and he's like oh can you put penis liquor can you put SpongeBob [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Captain Butthead put dry lips yeah so that's what you do he's making a compelling arent that's crazy I'm at work yeah I'm at work and he has to be there girl girl I'm at work let me let me finish my shift then we can chat I just think it's interesting how when you show up my chatting he just ignores me and I'm like is he mad at me one time I did say League of grayscale but I don't think he saw that so you said what I said League of gray scale what does that mean it means when you're dead the map is turned fire I I heard it in a little bit of a me now that he's explained that now that he's explained I think it's funny man when I play league I genuinely don't read the chat yes you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do cuz you will look at chat be like I don't think I buy that guy in the chat I only look at chat when I need help which is usually when I'm buying cuz I don't know what to buy but you also don't like the back seaters I don't like them until I like them you pck and you pck and I'm not I'm not very consistent dude what if the four of us ceed fire the yard takes your yard goes on the rift I would do that I like it us and CH we play one epic game we win we're Champions forever we lose we never talk again and we've w we should like in-house against uh like OTV or something but they would way better like the sh the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] of OTV there are no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] who are the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we could play vers uh fear and yeah that would but that H's ogre hand failing to grip the mouse God I can't I can't I can't press what a freak looked at him close up got WS going on that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] weird freak yeah I think uh a big eye on his chest too much milk I mean look that's the future of PSL no that's when it's dead that's gross the future PSL is a 5v5 in-house no the second we're playing computer games it's PSL dead no real [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it just evolves no no no no no no Conor we yelled at Conor for this take Connor eat pant eat pant no this he was like let's play Halo MCC at PSL and bring computers I'm like eat garbage from a garbage Alex messaged me he's like I'm so glad you yelled at him oh why don't we just get in a big Discord and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] talk to each other online so we don't have to meet up Alex says the worst thing we've ever done for PSL is make an awesome Discord to talk to cuz now no one needs to hang out in person cuz we all love talking in the Discord to each other I'm like I don't think you're in a lot of Discord servers no uh the look The Last PSO I'm saying we don't have enough games then bring some FIFA what games what games would you add into the roster I feel like core PSL is if is the FPS console experience agree I agree but I don't I think I don't think PS needs more games I think PSL needs a format it needs like a weekly leaderboard we need like we need like subcultures and certain team groupings that have a name and little fake logos we make and fun stuff like that right now and prizes like like we make a t-shirt you get if you win show up to PSL and you you get a pizza that tastes like cardboard Nick for nothing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] my God start every single week Jay sees that pizza and goes that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] looks fire bro J's up and then you get a 4v4 session that starts off pretty unbalanced and gets its way there as games go on and then you get you know 30 minutes of tech support cuz Nick's got to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] figure out how to log in cuz he's the only guy trying to log in oh and so you want your cuz you need your blunt trauma thing and then while he's doing that and while he's doing that you know what else happens at PSL every week what shark tank what I'm getting oh you're getting pitched I'm getting pitched you don't like getting pitched I don't want to get I don't even feel comfortable saying that bit without them here I feel like they should say that bit that bit this was a fullon pitch they're asking for $200,000 from me so Alex says has come up Alex Alex uh it who was it it was Alex J and who else was it who was there we talked about this on the Pod Robin Mike's there's another one there's another one I shouldn't bring up the other one cuz the other one leg and Jessie was there yeah it it does have legs I cuz they they they pitch it to me the other night and I'm like this has legs oh yeah we'll let it has legs we'll have Alex on and we'll let him do the pitch for us they got logos for all of them they always have logos they always have logos they have no product they have no product but they're they're like they're like yeah we want to make throbin mics which is an alcoholic drink that has creatine in it and we need 200k and I'm like okay what's that for and they're like well you give us 200k we'll get you a product by February like that's far away and then he's like all right well I can do 100K and I get The Branding done I was like the product should come first he goes no no no no branded they they have a branding forward strategy so they liquid death Brave of them there no product liquid liquid death is a product with good branding they are only branding so they they will show you how they're going to Brand the product but they don't actually have any the issue is it's not a generic enough product to let that happen because they're trying to make an Innovative product while being branding forward yeah they're a branding agency who needs a special product to work this bit made me go back and watch Powerthirst oh any Powerthirst fans in the chat yeah if anyone else is 36 listening uh I'm sure you'll your eyes lit I was like look this is like a dead type of video like these aren't really that like funny anymore but there's parts that video where I'm like that's funny sounds like it sounds like fight milk and Always Sunny no one talked like that until that that video came out came first bite milk or power thirst fite milk was later on power thirst definitely was first really yeah I I would put 90% on it that's a it's a tough call for me uh Pokey next week yeah poke man on the yard is this a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it why not leaky little leak she coming she's in great KN Pawn right now we should pitch her on without your guidance a product yo we should try to get her to make a product with she mightest poke X the yard and it's like um like I don't know like little tech decks she lowkey she could have vest yeah a pokem man uh set of barbells barbells and Olympic weights yeah oh a Pokemon man get fit experience yeah and and like every [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] plate has her face on it yeah yeah that'd be kind of cool yeah I'm lifting dude it's a whole it's like a whole like offline TV maybe like a pokem man scuff controller that's kind of hard yeah remember one of the guys at the valerant uh thing that was it the Brew battles thing the one of the players the pro players was so psyched me Pokémon man yeah he's like a young pro player who was like uh can I get a picture oh yeah of the people I have collabed with she's the one that most people freak out about she's a big deal I think she's famous she's famous dude I'm coming to that conclusion you're you're you're arriving there I'm getting there cuz I think she's pretty damn I think she's more famous then didn't he me no Barack J Obama Barack J Obama Barack that's not his middle initial different Barack then yeah then yeah cuz I don't know Barack H is very famous you guys ever seen his brother on Twitter yeah it's crazy that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I wish I had a evil brother like that like out there like constantly like downfall yeah he's probably pumped on the election yeah I mean he was pumped in 2016 yeah yeah he's probably experiencing roller coaster emotions how did that even happen I wonder that too where did they divert like have such a diverse think it's a half brother I think it is yeah so I think just different they didn't w't raised together that's so funny do you think if we were brothers you'd respect me more or less less for sure why less because I would know you inside and out yeah you know my beautiful secret hard ass pick though damn that is a hard ass pick wait me and fake ass a snake is that what it says zoom in fake ass a snake fake ass a snake when he was a nobody Jesus when he was a nobody that's not fair everyone's a nobody at one point well he knew him when he was a nobody you know Eric this is Malik it's horrible they tried to kill your dad thank God they didn't succeed he's alive and breathing all my prayers for your family I will be voting for your dad in November funny to say it's Malik yeah hey me sorry hey it's me that's how parents text yeah yeah we're in that Boomer H not me I were you're signing off on text no we just do [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that young people don't do that's true we're we're onk we're onk age they they're they're they're blue tag looking up [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we're Googling [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] still what is blue tag oh no no what is that I don't know what that is what is it jobin this is an un safe area I know what it is it's like uh the blue text on like Tik Tok What are you guys being dead ass I'm being dead ass with you sir I'm not on I'm not ashamed of this I'm 34 you've been giving me [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for first off nice print second off it's when you go to Tik Tok and then there's like a blue thing in a text comment that you can click to look it up oh oh with a little magnifying class yeah okay okay is it like a community note type [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's more like a bouncing uh text like a hyperlink it's a hyperlink it's all but it aop populates if you put in a very like easily easily identifiable search term I see so someone would like put a horror video and then someone would write wow this is the Jonestown Massacre and sometimes people do it in hopes of being the blue text oh that's so interesting and then you click it and then you learn about it's a market e blue waffles and then blue waffle would show up and then someone would probably being like don't click the Blue Link dude I saw one of a video it was like I I I don't like to be too Doomer about like the Zoomers are cringe now like we've lost the idea of media or anything but there was a a video of three NPC streamers set up outside of McDonald's just all doing their like different and I was like this is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up that's Beast it's not beast beast no it's not but we had QVC QVC was just that's not the same how what's QVC wow I don't know this is here you UPS really uh you probably know it's just like it was it was a channel devoted only to online shopping uh they spoofed it in South Park it's like they they'd have like a rotating thing oh this one's for $449.99 we're going to do deal $39.99 M grow used to do it yeah there was a my mom used to clean the house of this crazy lady who was really rich she some got this huge inheritance and she had bo she was like a hoarder oh we've done this section before she had boxes and boxes and boxes of QVC it was like this is this is rot can't both you can say that they're both rot I'm not saying that the McDonald's people aren't rot I'm saying Rod's been around and it'll always be around we're just watching new new age rot being like this new rot is bad it's like this is just new rot no all the rots been bad let let me ask you this I don't think there's more rot you don't think there's more rot now there definitely more rot I think there is more rot now simply because the means to produce the rot are more accessible that be true but maybe the percentage of rot hasn't increased I also think there's like somewhat I I feel like there's a difference between something like that where the goal is to maximize how much money you make whereas like now it's to maximize attention I feel like that's a different I mean those NPC people are trying to maximize money yeah they they are very much like trying to cram in because you get paid for every it's definitely for both but I I think that like I don't know I I feel like the internet has become more about like you want to be famous and that comes with a lifestyle that you want but I think the attention thing is a little sicker a little more Twisted so you think that the pursuit of capital is more acceptable than the pursuit of Fame with or without it yeah yeah I think so too yeah I I have always believed that because it's ethereal right they're both weird and kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but I think the the fame and the the attention thing is a little bit sinister let me ask you this was Jerry Springer rot yeah he was SLO slop right that's like one of the first slops but I think I look back on Jerry Springer in a fond way well yeah cuz that was your slop that was your rot that was my slop and so now I'm asking myself are the kids now going to look at the McDonald's NP stre who goes Yeehaw they're going to look back at it as like that's so old and corny cuz I think you'd look back be nostalg for it far enough away from bro remember that guy miles Mor guy you jump in be like looks like another galaxy whoa you know what I mean be like that was so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] funny dude uh and there's also like levels to rock as I think a lot of people would look like like an an average like IRL twitch stream and be like wow this is hella rot yeah and then you go to NPC my bronze one gameplay could be rough maybe I remember I I was seeing this girl this is like a long time ago when twitch wasn't really it was like I don't know twitch wasn't as big as it is now and I told her about I was watching uh agdq I was watching TW speedrunning and I had to like explain it and she was like hold hold on people watch people play video games why would you watch someone do that and I'm like that's a hard question to answer you right now like you are not going to accept any answer I give I always think it's like I always think that question is so easy to answer in like to any Normie cuz it's like we watch we don't play sports we watch sports a lot because we want to see people who are way better than us at it do it that's what video games are for yeah I think that's hiding behind the real reason no but I think for for that example that's the exact reason sure yeah for agdq for Esports and stuff like that I think most of streaming that's not it but I think for most of streaming it's uh you know making the boring parts of your day a little less boring and also Bugs Bunny Gets to talk to you sometimes and that feels really good for your brain is important shame why

I like reading the actual book I don't like doing the audio book but I was like okay I if I want to finish this book in time I have to the audio book and I did the math and I'm like well [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the amount of time I have I I don't want to I don't want to do this for like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 9 hours a day or whatever so I was like I have to put it up the speed and I was like well anything over like two I'm not following cuz it's already so sci-fi and and kind of dense so I was like two crazy alone so I was like all right I'm going to try 1.5 and I was doing that and I was just
