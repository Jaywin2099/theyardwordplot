 What? &gt;&gt; Also, I said I was gonna be nicer to chat. This is &gt;&gt; But you also weren't though. &gt;&gt; Uh, I was way nicer than I was the day before. The thing is there's &gt;&gt; I don't think a man with anime skateboards on the wall is progressing at a fast rate. If you have a kid, you are. &gt;&gt; Oh, whoa. Whoa. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, my bad. What's wrong with that? I don't think you have a single skateboard. &gt;&gt; Uh, I do have a skateboard. &gt;&gt; Where is it? &gt;&gt; Three. &gt;&gt; What's on three skateboards? &gt;&gt; I got three skateboards. Okay, let's &gt;&gt; One piece board. &gt;&gt; Three boards. I got a South Park one. &gt;&gt; Okay. Who name two characters from South Park? &gt;&gt; Cartman &gt;&gt; and Towi. &gt;&gt; Towi. &gt;&gt; Towi is crazy. &gt;&gt; He says Towi. &gt;&gt; Towi's the one whose name is what he is. He knows ball. &gt;&gt; The one that a child could remember. &gt;&gt; Balln knower. &gt;&gt; He's a ball knower. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And then I have one my sister painted me with my childhood favorite stuffed animal, Ziggy, on it. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And then I got a Ryan Sheckler board. &gt;&gt; You got a Cryan Sheckler board. Life of crying. &gt;&gt; No, it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Ryan. And people like you made his life. &gt;&gt; Do you like him cuz he's a Red Bull athlete? &gt;&gt; I like him because he knows how to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] skate and he was hot when he was 16. When I was 13. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; When he was No, I get it. When you were 13. Yeah. This This &gt;&gt; When you were 13, he was hot. He was &gt;&gt; I thought he was hot when he was 16. &gt;&gt; Were you hot? &gt;&gt; Huh? No. I was chopped. &gt;&gt; You were chopped. Chopped 13. Hot 16. &gt;&gt; I wish I could be hot like Ryan, right? &gt;&gt; Ryan, I think we've done this before, but he has to have a chopped hairline now, right? &gt;&gt; Yes, we've done this. Yes, he does. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; I thought I thought he shaves that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but it still looks good. &gt;&gt; It was widows peeking for sure. It's not like him. &gt;&gt; Not like him. &gt;&gt; You just sometimes you forget. &gt;&gt; Oh, Ryan. Ryan. &gt;&gt; Forget what? What's &gt;&gt; What's wrong? &gt;&gt; Nothing, man. &gt;&gt; What's wrong, sweetie? &gt;&gt; It's so shaved. &gt;&gt; Your beautiful hard launched glasses. &gt;&gt; It's so shaved, man. Don't bring attention to them. &gt;&gt; Why not? I'm Why would I not bring attention to it? It looks like they came from the land that never was in Kingdom Hearts 2. &gt;&gt; No, bro. It's the Xenon Zool glasses. &gt;&gt; My my my prescript my prescription Zen. I don't know how you say it in xenon. &gt;&gt; My prescript zins and it's prescribed zins. &gt;&gt; My prescription major. &gt;&gt; Me and had an idea on our trip where we became best friends and the new uh the new dynamic duo on the show. &gt;&gt; Okay. You guys want to hear? &gt;&gt; Sorry boys. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You guys want to hear it now? &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Do you want to tell them? &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Do you want to tell them the idea? &gt;&gt; Uh no, I don't. &gt;&gt; Okay, I'll do it. &gt;&gt; The dynamic sounds really good by &gt;&gt; Wow, it's off to a great start. &gt;&gt; We did come up with it together. So, &gt;&gt; no. It feels like it Aiden's dropping into your seat. &gt;&gt; I'm sitting here trying to remember what it is. That's what I'm doing. We're dynamic. I want you guys to know, but I'm trying. &gt;&gt; The idea we had in the airport. &gt;&gt; We flew on 911. &gt;&gt; We did fly on 911. &gt;&gt; We flew on 911. &gt;&gt; So, kept literally kept asking the woman next to us if she needs protection and that he's here for her. &gt;&gt; No, you didn't. &gt;&gt; I went I went, "Do you know what day it is?" &gt;&gt; That's crazy. &gt;&gt; I I can take care of you. So your Mark Wahberg is just some random strange I lean over. I go, "Hey, if anything happens to do something funny on the plane uh because I'm, you know, I'm his passenger princess cuz he had a secret shoot in New York and I I just went along for the ride cuz I had to go out there, too." &gt;&gt; Well, Ledwig pays for the monkey. &gt;&gt; Lewig pays for the monkey. The monkey is Lewig. Mr. pays for it. &gt;&gt; The monkey The monkey brass. &gt;&gt; That That was It was good monkey. You shelled out for the monkey. &gt;&gt; I let the monkey know that the monkey will be taken care of. And if anything with those glasses, you said, "I want you." &gt;&gt; As if anything's going to happen on that plane to that monkey. I would step between it. &gt;&gt; Lwig bought those glasses for the monkey &gt;&gt; less than 24 hours from the flight. I'm trying to get Lwig to send me my confirmation code and he hasn't sent it yet. And uh I want to put TSA pre on my ticket. And he finally he finally text me. He goes, "I did something crazy with our flight, our flight on 911." He's like, "It's something crazy. I wanted to commemorate the 911 thing. &gt;&gt; And so I'm thinking like what could he possibly mean? Maybe he means like I booked us first class. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; but that's not crazy for &gt;&gt; that's he wouldn't he wouldn't prejack something like that. He would we would just show up and he'd be like yeah first class. What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do you mean man? That's how or he'd play a prank on me where I'm in coach and he's in first class which I don't think he'd actually do. &gt;&gt; So we we I finally get my confirmation code and I noticed &gt;&gt; I don't have one ticket. I have three. Lewig booked me a row on the plane. &gt;&gt; What? And he booked himself a row on the plane. &gt;&gt; Was the row across from each other? &gt;&gt; They were they were front and back &gt;&gt; and it's six total seats. &gt;&gt; Wasn't two two. It was &gt;&gt; Did you lay them all down and put a blanket down? &gt;&gt; Well, we get to the airport pretty late uh cuz I left my phone in the Uber and we had to wait for it to come back. &gt;&gt; And uh yeah, that was my big L. And uh so apparently when you book multiple seats, I didn't know this and Lewig did know this in a weird way. This is fat guy tech. &gt;&gt; You have to This is fat guy tech. If you're out there and you're and you're large, sorry that we're sold out so fast in the merch. And also, you probably know this. Um, you have to put X's. &gt;&gt; You put XS. It stands for extra seat in your middle name. &gt;&gt; In your middle name. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; And if you don't do that, they ass they assume it's like what? A mistake. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Like you've bought the two of the ticket for the same price. &gt;&gt; And they give your seats away. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So Lwig does not put XS with his own name, but he does with mine. &gt;&gt; So I don't So he knows the tech? &gt;&gt; No, hold up. I Let me defend myself. It's because the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] terrorists at the airline company, okay, who probably did 9/11? &gt;&gt; If you think about it, they operate the &gt;&gt; complicit. Complicit cuz why did the plane even take off? &gt;&gt; And all they say planes fly themselves. Why they fly under the tower then? Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's a good question that we didn't ask at the time, but we should ask it now. &gt;&gt; Why do they do that? &gt;&gt; So, anyway, I &gt;&gt; Delta's autopilot. &gt;&gt; Why does this go through? &gt;&gt; It's just so low through New York. &gt;&gt; I mean, I mean, it's worked out in the past. So, we don't know how to do it. So, &gt;&gt; it tries to go vertical between them. &gt;&gt; Uh, yeah. I the I the business class there's one left and I thought about it. I thought about it. &gt;&gt; You thought about leaving your pillow princess behind in the dirt realm? &gt;&gt; I thought about I wouldn't I wouldn't be upset. &gt;&gt; Wait, what airline is this? &gt;&gt; This is Delta. &gt;&gt; Uh Delta. &gt;&gt; Oh, so it's probably better to have the row cuz you can actually lay down, right? &gt;&gt; Well, that's what I was thinking. So, I get the row for Nick and it was way cheaper than a business class flight. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it was like the business class flight's 3,000 a ticket. insane. And the three seats was 1,200. So I was like, "Let me just get let me get a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] row." &gt;&gt; Interesting. &gt;&gt; Let me ball out because we had a red eye and we had to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hit the ground running the next day. &gt;&gt; You sleep? &gt;&gt; And uh but then when I go to book mine, the airlines figured my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] jig. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; And they increased the ticket from 400 to,200. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; For one of the seats. &gt;&gt; So then I decided &gt;&gt; in coach &gt;&gt; in coach. So I decided I would be tricky. I'd be shifty. I'd get three different devices and I'd book the 400 cuz if you buy one it's only 400. So I buy three ones at the same time and I went boop and then it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] caught me cuz it said the loading wheel and then one went through and then the other two were like uh sorry the price has changed. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; At checkout it said the price has changed. &gt;&gt; That's crazy actually. &gt;&gt; And so I was like son of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Where are they allowed to do this? So, you had to sit next to some poor woman who got the brunt of your fury. &gt;&gt; What actually ended up happening is I sat in the same row as Nick. &gt;&gt; And we used we used the middle seat as like our trash seat and the lady in the row in front lied down cuz she had that whole [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to herself. &gt;&gt; And so, we basically paid for what you paid. Did you get a refund on the first two or I get a refund on one? You paid for four seats and neither of you got the benefit of the paid for? &gt;&gt; I paid for four seats cuz I got a refund on one. So, I paid for four seats and I got the benefit of sitting of a middle seat, the benefit of three seats. I And I gave a and I gave a nice lady an entire row to you said, "Hello, lady. It's it's terrorism day, lady." &gt;&gt; This was also I leaned over and I said and I said, "These next five minutes won't be a problem." &gt;&gt; Cage, we're going into the towers. Cage. &gt;&gt; Cage. Swerve kids. &gt;&gt; Swerve kids. We're going back &gt;&gt; tables. No. &gt;&gt; Jack Black and Kyle G into the powers. &gt;&gt; I'm about to put it up Osama's ass. &gt;&gt; Um, wow. Um, but the funny part also this flight was packed. Like not an open seat on the whole flight. So I was just socially like, "Oh my god, we're going to be two guys with their own rows." That is gross. &gt;&gt; On a fully packed flight where everyone's in a bad mood. &gt;&gt; It was empty as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] when I bought it, too, which is why I went for this plane. Literally, everyone's in a horrible mood on this flight. &gt;&gt; It's a red eyee. It's an M. Right. &gt;&gt; You know, when the flight attendants are also mad. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Like there there was there was this man behind us on the phone just like having a phone call. The flight attendant I'm not kid I'm not exact. I love it. You're going to attest to this. I'm not exaggerating. She's going, "Sir, you need to get off the phone." &gt;&gt; And she's like she's you're him. I'm her. This is how close she is. Sir. &gt;&gt; He's just like, &gt;&gt; "Sir, you need Yes." And she she says it maybe six, seven, eight times. And he just doesn't get off the phone. Just says on the phone. &gt;&gt; That's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy. &gt;&gt; And this is the guy right behind us. &gt;&gt; He he he was a devious man. He initially sat in the wrong seat. They came up. They said he had to sit in a different seat. And then he needed his like son or &gt;&gt; friend. And I absolutely pulverized or friend. &gt;&gt; I don't know if they're related. They were both wearing his son and or friend. And then I and then I absolutely pulverized Lewig in tic-tac-toe. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; You heard Dak in the middle by the way. It's a different type of tic tac-toe on the plane. &gt;&gt; Interesting. &gt;&gt; It's a It's actually better. &gt;&gt; It's actually a good game. &gt;&gt; They actually fixed &gt;&gt; Wait, they fixed tic tac toe. &gt;&gt; It's only on It's not tic tac-toe at all. &gt;&gt; It's actually connect four. &gt;&gt; It's just Connect 4. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Except uh there's there's certain different certain holes are question marks and if you get to them, you get powerups. So your neck, you have the option to play a power up, &gt;&gt; but it's called tic-tac-toe. &gt;&gt; Tic tac-toe. &gt;&gt; Tic tac toe. &gt;&gt; And the power ups are pretty beast. So like &gt;&gt; it's like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] game. And Nick was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rolling power. He's rolling great. &gt;&gt; He tends to roll good. He tends to roll good. &gt;&gt; I will say he rolls good. &gt;&gt; I think I six1ed him. &gt;&gt; 61. That's embarrassing. Not a sweep. &gt;&gt; He rolls good. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I don't know. You get aces that many times it's either something's wrong with you or something's wrong with the deck. &gt;&gt; No, you get the win power up. you're just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] And I kept getting the wind power up. &gt;&gt; Wind is pretty good because it takes the whole board and rotates it &gt;&gt; and it confuses &gt;&gt; and then it changes. You might have you might have a couple four in a rows and &gt;&gt; zipper. I sent you something in the group chat. Can you pull it up whenever you can? &gt;&gt; Um &gt;&gt; it's like you just did not use wind. &gt;&gt; Did you guys was lost with &gt;&gt; you guys have a lovely time? Oh uh this is a All right. &gt;&gt; The Kingdom Hearts thing. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And making fun of me is dead. &gt;&gt; This is a It's a key. It's the keyblade to become one from Kingdom Hearts. &gt;&gt; And he wants to see how these are like my glasses. &gt;&gt; That's what you put on your face. &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; wow. &gt;&gt; Maybe we can just do like a round. &gt;&gt; Where does he get the keyblade from? &gt;&gt; Is it from Kyrie? &gt;&gt; He gets it from a nobody. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; because it's it's the world that ever was. Dude, th this weekend I went to Wachi for uh a bachelor party for my my best friend from high school. &gt;&gt; Where the hell is that? Washi. &gt;&gt; Wachi. It's in the mountains in Washington. Like &gt;&gt; why did you say Wachi? &gt;&gt; What? What do you mean? &gt;&gt; Is it known? &gt;&gt; How you say it? &gt;&gt; No, like the place. &gt;&gt; Washi. Should &gt;&gt; I know if you're from Washington? &gt;&gt; He said he said it like it's like we all go there for you said it like have &gt;&gt; Wachi Washington. Yeah, I guess it is saying you went to, you know, rifle, Colorado. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I went to Rifle, Colorado. &gt;&gt; I went to Rifle. &gt;&gt; I went to Rifle &gt;&gt; and everybody knows what you mean. Rifle &gt;&gt; the &gt;&gt; All right. So, what what was in Wanachi? &gt;&gt; The mountains of Washi. &gt;&gt; Well, his the Bachelor, the the presumed groom, he's a huge fan of Kingdom Hearts. And on the second night that we're all hanging out, uh, one of our friends, who's also Nick, uh, comes out dressed in a full like wizard costume and he's playing Runescape, like wizard music out of a Bluetooth speaker and he he's changed his voice and he's like, "Everyone come for the ceremony." And he and he he's and we're all like, "What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] going on? Nobody knows what's happening." He ushers everyone down and he has crafted like three challenges through the house and like guides us through this ceremony of how our groom Alec is is becoming the protector of the realm and at the end he gave him a keyblade like a full remade keyblade from his like favorite video game. Was the groom was he like stoked on this? &gt;&gt; Yeah, he thought it was awesome. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Funny. Funny is the best you can get. &gt;&gt; It's really hit or miss. It's really This is the most dope [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ever. It's like, "Oh god, this is &gt;&gt; I mean it done [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hold a candle to Temper's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bachelor party, &gt;&gt; dude. He had it at Scooter's Jungle. There was a bounce house. &gt;&gt; That [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] was lit. &gt;&gt; I I will say from what it sounds like as Kingdom Hearts head and you know, another one on the panel here, it sounds like he kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. Sounds like nothing had to do with Kingdom Hearts. &gt;&gt; It is low. Kingdom Hearts the Keyblade at the end. &gt;&gt; Yeah, the keyblade at the end doesn't kind of make s like Kingdom Hearts a very &gt;&gt; He tied it in like he kept calling us organization 19 cuz there's 19 people there and uh &gt;&gt; good reference. And Nick doesn't play Kingdom Hearts at all. &gt;&gt; I can tell which makes it &gt;&gt; he's playing Runescape music weird the things you can find from Google. &gt;&gt; He's the Runescape. He's the Runescape skits though. It's so funny to be like, "Oh, my friend really likes Kingdom Hearts. How can I make Runescape a part of this?" &gt;&gt; It's more like it's he loves Kingdom Hearts, but I've only ever consumed Runescape. &gt;&gt; How do I get there? &gt;&gt; But the keyblade he got at the end looked almost exactly like that one. And I was like, that's crazy. &gt;&gt; It's just a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fire. God, &gt;&gt; you're also you're also wearing Mario Goate. I am. And and and I realized that I have something. So, I was unpacking my backpack in the airport and like getting a a charger out of the bottom of the bag and I pulled on the cord and then up flips onto the ground a Polaroid of Luigi Goatsy and this woman is just looking straight down on it and I kind of make eye contact with her. Neither of us say anything. I put it back in the bag and I was like, "It's maybe it's time for this Polaroid." &gt;&gt; That's on her. That's on her. Mind your own [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] business. On 911, you mind your own [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] business because you never know what'll happen. &gt;&gt; Why are you not allowed to have a bag filled with Luigi goatsies? &gt;&gt; I It just It feels like she might have different expectations of what I'm about, you know? &gt;&gt; What What What does she need to even have an expectation? Her expectation should be that you don't have a bomb. &gt;&gt; Maybe I need to set free. Maybe I need to set myself free. Set &gt;&gt; yourself free, bro. Like, don't worry. &gt;&gt; You could have 80 dildos in there on your way to a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] NFL game. That's what this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] country was built on. Having dildosed. Do you think you can bring Don't you think that would qualify as a weapon? &gt;&gt; If you bring a break, &gt;&gt; a dildo on a plane. A big I mean, there's definitely dildos that would be classified as weapons, but I don't think the ones that you're rocking. &gt;&gt; Get that. &gt;&gt; Are you saying he uses dildos? &gt;&gt; I don't think you I don't think you rock. You can't handle a bad hand. &gt;&gt; If I had them, they would be huge. They would be They would not be weapons. They would not be they would be qualified as &gt;&gt; wives. It is embarrassing to think like a dildo is like okay you get the big one. We want big dildos. &gt;&gt; You quiver for some little [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Do they make small dildos? That's my question. Like do they make a dildo the size of my &gt;&gt; Let me tell you. Let me tell you. Most &gt;&gt; What are you talking about? Most &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a dildo. Not a vibrational. &gt;&gt; Uh that still most. &gt;&gt; Not a vibrational. &gt;&gt; I think most I've seen the cocky rock. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I think most. Do you think most I don't think that hard? &gt;&gt; I don't think so. &gt;&gt; Also hard. It'd be really funny to have a dildo that size of my dick. It would be so funny. You'd be like, "What? Why? Why they make it?" &gt;&gt; That might be most of them. &gt;&gt; I think it's most I mean maybe you know a little bigger a little bit. &gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] off. Like you know slightly &gt;&gt; but around the size. &gt;&gt; My beef is when they have dildos that are like Pikachu and stuff. You ever seen like the crazy characters or it's like Pickle Rick and it's like who's &gt;&gt; Pickle Rick makes sense. &gt;&gt; Whose preference is that though? &gt;&gt; Well, &gt;&gt; imagine having an earthshattering orgasm to pickle. &gt;&gt; Pickle Rick. &gt;&gt; It was like that guy who was showcasing what's the ones where it's the tubes flesh. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; You're showcasing fleshs on Tik Tok. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But there would be like crazy Rick and Morty mouth. &gt;&gt; I feel like &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; You remember this one? &gt;&gt; Pickle Rick dildo might be it. It's It's a dildo that's been used in more sexual encounters that are filmed than not. &gt;&gt; There has to be a Pickle Rick porn scene where someone is just dressed in green. &gt;&gt; This guy, this guy, he shows off flashlights. So, he's got like the &gt;&gt; Oh, no. Mike Wazowski. &gt;&gt; He's got the flashlight. &gt;&gt; Oh, leave Mike out of this, man. &gt;&gt; Yeah. All he does is show ridiculous ones. And definitely don't look up Berto. &gt;&gt; They both got the teeth out, too. I don't like that, &gt;&gt; dude. Mike Wazowski and it's poking out the back of his skin like you know &gt;&gt; you know what I mean? &gt;&gt; Oh my god. Yuck. &gt;&gt; We've done this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; He's doing the &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Damn. You think Sully's got hair on it? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; I think the top up to the tip. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Monkeys have like bare ass red penis. &gt;&gt; The tip is pink. &gt;&gt; He's not a monkey. No, but what I'm saying is like animals that we see their penises. Red bear. &gt;&gt; How many animal penises you seen? &gt;&gt; So many. &gt;&gt; Like so. Dogs. They count. You see a dog in public? &gt;&gt; A skull. &gt;&gt; Oh, this one's just inclusive. &gt;&gt; Have you seen Have you seen a giraffe penis? &gt;&gt; Day of the dead. &gt;&gt; Dues. I can't I don't want to. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Have you? &gt;&gt; I think we have on this pod. No. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we've probably seen most of the animal penises we've seen has probably been on this pod. Did you ask me on our trip? We went to we went to a land cafe. We ran into a shake drizzle in New York. &gt;&gt; This is real. &gt;&gt; What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; That's right. He went to Wolfpack. &gt;&gt; Uh, and so we we had a land cafe. We three stacked some league and the the piece. This is the same place that I went to with CP and uh and we sat down at this computer. Love sat down at the computer and the last person left their whole life logged in. &gt;&gt; They were logged in on everything. They logged into their Google suite. They're logged into Discord. I had access to their Twitter &gt;&gt; and they were following a lot of right-wing &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; they were following hella right-wing pundits and they were probably logged in for a while cuz I went to their Discord and their name on Discord was I love children. &gt;&gt; Yeah, their Discord name was I love children all caps. &gt;&gt; What like I love McConen. &gt;&gt; I thought it was self and I thought that's like just what they call themselves on Discord. I was like weird. Then I realized oh no, someone just changed it because they've just been logged in. &gt;&gt; They've been logged in the whole time. &gt;&gt; You weren't the first one there. What's Well, I don't know if that's true. &gt;&gt; It is. And I know it's true because I entered a Discord call. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; But did they mention it? &gt;&gt; Yeah. I I was on his account and I went into a Discord. &gt;&gt; This is where I was going &gt;&gt; and it was like one of the top, you know, Discords is popping and I hop in &gt;&gt; and the moment I hop in the guy goes, "Ruben." &gt;&gt; He goes, he goes, "No, it was really sweet." He goes, "Hey, Reuben." And he's and he's and he's and he's like all excited to see Reuben. And there's it's like a girl, too. Dude, she's like, "Oh my gosh, Reuben. &gt;&gt; Oh my god, he doesn't show up in the call a lot." &gt;&gt; That's what they they're like, "He's back." That's how they phrase it. Like, "He's back." And I was like And I was like, "What up's Reuben?" &gt;&gt; Dude, that's so funny. &gt;&gt; And I think &gt;&gt; that's not Reuben. &gt;&gt; I think Reuben must sound like a quivering [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] comparatively cuz they instantly clocked. I wasn't Reuben. &gt;&gt; Probably. &gt;&gt; And L goes, "What do you mean? I love children. Dude, dude, you think that maybe that maybe this is the thinking of a better world where the Twitter account was normal, but then someone followed a bunch of right-wing stuff. The way we ruined that one guy's algorithm in the Airbnb. &gt;&gt; It was very subtle like Trump retweets. It wasn't like like the funny ones. It was just like random announcements. &gt;&gt; I read one DM and it said Steve Bannon is back. Exclamation point. Oh my god. &gt;&gt; And I've never heard someone say that before. &gt;&gt; That's That is That is crazy. Did By the way, the computers run like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] No, they're they're great. Interesting. &gt;&gt; Except for mine because with &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; within about 30 seconds of hitting the the the PC cafe &gt;&gt; the second we get there. &gt;&gt; I'm waiting for Nick uh cuz he's getting his stuff set up. And so I'm like, "Oh my god, I would love to read the newest chapter of One Piece." &gt;&gt; Of course. &gt;&gt; Uh &gt;&gt; what? That is Is that not something that you do at a land cafe? &gt;&gt; Read One Piece? &gt;&gt; Yes. Read manga. That's normal. So, &gt;&gt; did you Well, did you get buttass naked like you usually do? &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, problem I'm I'm butt ass naked and then I I go to read it, but now I should clarify. I'm reading it on TCB scans &gt;&gt; because it's not available uh through the official release. And so when I open it, it says you have to click this box to prove you're a human. I go, sure, of course. Uh and then it says like click here to read. And I click here and then something downloads and I'm like that's weird. I don't want to download it. I want to watch it in my browser. &gt;&gt; That's usually weird cuz this works &gt;&gt; weird. &gt;&gt; And then &gt;&gt; whatever. &gt;&gt; And then uh I I recclick it cuz I feel like I did something wrong. And then as I do that, it pops up with [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Macaffy antivirus popups like on the computer. It just goes ding. &gt;&gt; He's getting like three a minute. &gt;&gt; It's so frequent. It's literally like and I drag it and it and at 15 seconds later it's like ding and it's like another [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Did you brick a lane cafe? &gt;&gt; I know. I just threw a bunch of adear on over and like dig gave the computer malware and I'm like dude we've been here for like 5 minutes. How the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do you do that? He's like one piece. I'm like I hate you so much. &gt;&gt; And I couldn't even get the One Piece thing open without ad block. It was literally too hard to do without ad block. &gt;&gt; And the guy comes over the the guy who like runs the cafe comes over and he's like hey did you download anything? &gt;&gt; No. He dead ass said that. He was like, "That's so embarrassing. &gt;&gt; Ping's pretty high here. Did you download anything?" I went, "Nope." &gt;&gt; Why would you say no? &gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Guess [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] him. &gt;&gt; Nope. &gt;&gt; No. What do you mean? &gt;&gt; Hold up. Hold up. I I had many evil thoughts there. I thought about tweeting on this guy's account. I thought about messaging someone. I thought about being mischievous. Okay. But here's how I ended it. Okay. I &gt;&gt; I didn't do anything on his accounts, &gt;&gt; but I left you joined the call. &gt;&gt; Nope. I just opened every single tab that he was logged into and I left it open and I said if the next person wants to be a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] evil person that's on them. I've done nothing wrong here. &gt;&gt; I was in the village. &gt;&gt; You're in a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] land cafe. Log out of your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; I did nothing to be to be like completely fair to this guy. I don't know how it works. It's very confusing cuz so like you you don't just like get on a computer and like play games. It's like you have an account at the Land Cafe. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And it's what's supposed to happen is when you log into your account, if you have if you have passwords saved and stuff or whatever or I think it's just full wipes every time you leave, it's what's supposed to happen. And when I when I use these PCs on my account, I check like I every single time I log in, I play, I log out, I go, "Oh my god, I didn't log out of anything." I log back in and it auto logged me out of everything. &gt;&gt; I don't know why whenever I go and sit down, the the last person is logged in, but it never happens to me. Maybe he paid for like two hours, an hour goes by, he loses his league game, and he's like, "Oh my god, I'm late for the rally." &gt;&gt; Maybe he does like an autosave feature or something. I don't know. &gt;&gt; But he's not logged in. I'm logged in. It's weird. I don't It's not It doesn't super matter. But uh I I just go back in hinds. You can just go onto your accounts from home and just unlog yourself from home, which is what I make sure. &gt;&gt; And what I said, by the way, when I left to the owner, okay, who was smoking a cigarette a minute and he's outside smoking a cigarette. go, &gt;&gt; I think the last guy might have downloaded some malware on my computer. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. No. &gt;&gt; And and I went, "Maybe that was the ping issue." And he and he goes, "No, the ping issue was something else. Someone was downloading a game, so you're good." &gt;&gt; And I went I went, &gt;&gt; "But I think maybe &gt;&gt; there's Bonsie buddy jumping from monitor to monitor on every computer and he's just like, "Yeah, I guess it's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pig. I guess. &gt;&gt; So, we just showed up. We ined all of our games, downloaded malware, hacked a guy, &gt;&gt; committed a crime, &gt;&gt; and won a road game. &gt;&gt; And then won the road game. &gt;&gt; And then pieced the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out. And then Shay Drizzle slept on our couch. &gt;&gt; Shake Drizzle linking up with you guys is crazy. &gt;&gt; It was awesome. &gt;&gt; He got mad at me cuz the other day we were talking about like I was talking about how people in in Grandmaster would be like, "Low, master dog pig." And I was like, "Shake's been playing his whole life. He's lot master." He messaged me this morning and he's like, "I haven't been playing my whole life." He's like, "I played for seasons one through three and then and then one year since the today last year when Lewick started playing again cuz he made me play. I haven't played my whole life and I was like oh &gt;&gt; he threw in cuz he made me play. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; cuz I don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] play. &gt;&gt; Well, last year. Last year. &gt;&gt; He's still playing. &gt;&gt; He is still playing. &gt;&gt; You got him back on the smoke. &gt;&gt; It's crazy. It's not like I got him back on the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] smoke. This isn't crack cocaine. It's not Charlie Sheen's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] story. &gt;&gt; No, I think it is. It kind of is a little Charlie Sheen notes that he got addicted to crack when he did it for his first time and he got a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] from a hooker. &gt;&gt; Oh, at the same time. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; that's dangerous. Well, &gt;&gt; because it combines the feelings. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes. And he never went back. But I did not blow shake drizzle when he played a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] game of &gt;&gt; No, you just introduced him to the girl. &gt;&gt; No, the league is the girl. Yeah, it's an on and off again relationship with a with the worst girl that he's ever dated. &gt;&gt; Here's the here's the real tea that people don't understand. &gt;&gt; You did what you did at the Land Cafe. You set out the blow and then called the girl over and said, "I don't know what happens next." Like like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; I think I think genuinely League is not the problem. &gt;&gt; Excuse me, sister. &gt;&gt; League is not some like crack cocaine [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that you can't help possibly succumb to. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I think the problem is ego. &gt;&gt; Ego. That's the problem. What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; People who are addicted to League are obsessed with their own ego and they think that they deserve some crazy rank and that's and that ride is holding it away from &gt;&gt; and literally and literally period by the way. &gt;&gt; And they and they need to play to prove to to to the world that they are the rank they think they are. &gt;&gt; I disagree, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] And here's why. I don't think &gt;&gt; I've been playing normals and I just really want to play it. It it it gives you addictive. &gt;&gt; That's because you are literally doing like edging. You're gooning. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You're only allowed to play 21 ranked games a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] week and so you had four days where you couldn't play ranked. So you're dead ass edging cuz you're waiting for your rank. &gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] edging. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you. &gt;&gt; You would never You would never play a normal if you &gt;&gt; never [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] play a normal. &gt;&gt; You would never play a normal if you weren't limited. &gt;&gt; You're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] edging. You edged the edged in the car on the way here. And that's why you were [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; You're edging and you couldn't wait for yesterday when Sunday hit and you got oh my god I got to play ranked. &gt;&gt; I did. &gt;&gt; It probably so much. &gt;&gt; It's funny that it's like we set up this system. It's like this beautiful system so that we don't play too much league and in your head you're like I'll just play normals. That's different. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. We went to a land cafe and played on an all. &gt;&gt; I was bonding with you. &gt;&gt; I know. But you're not. &gt;&gt; But you went to &gt;&gt; I wouldn't have gone there alone. &gt;&gt; No. No. Not on this trip. No. No. No. &gt;&gt; No. Sure. For sure. &gt;&gt; Uh are most people playing AR- &gt;&gt; uh most people play League? Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But that &gt;&gt; You're wrong. &gt;&gt; No, I'm saying I'm saying &gt;&gt; you're a wrong [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; I'm saying in the shake drizzle sense cuz he's saying that I am the one who brought him back to League. &gt;&gt; Miles actually Miles actually put it like really eloquently uh recently. He like said like League is a is a game for people who are looking for a very specific type of dopamine. And your whole game you were just looking for situations where you can land that dopamine cycle. And if you miss it, aka they your team [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ins you or you get killed or whatever, that's what makes you tilt is you're not getting the dopamine you came here and looked for specifically. Winning feels pretty good, but winning and also doing those things is what you really want. And I think that especially why ARAM is popular is because you're it's just only that part. &gt;&gt; It distills the Yeah. the crazy dopamine releases. &gt;&gt; It's you just literally and then you have none of the the potential downside of defeat. Doesn't matter. Why are you addicted to Counter Strike, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; What? What? What do you wake up in Q for? &gt;&gt; What do I wake up in Q? &gt;&gt; Like, what do you look forward to? &gt;&gt; What is it all about? &gt;&gt; Is it head shot? Is it clutches? Get &gt;&gt; your shirt off. &gt;&gt; No, keep it on. I like it. &gt;&gt; What's it all about? &gt;&gt; You want me to wrap up CS thing? What is it? Milliondollar boy. &gt;&gt; Is it It's like a rank. No, like 20 [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 1K. &gt;&gt; No, I think not. Not in general. I I I really really like the like fundamental improvement at the game. Like I think it is fun to explore these different parts of attack shooter that I previously got kind of good at in Valerant and apply it to something new and like learn all these like little things and try to pull it together into a win and then just try to do that over and over and get a little better than I get a little better than I was the day before. I guess what I'm thinking of specifically is like in Street Fighter, Cammy has crouching medium punch and it has this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up hitbox that kind of invisible and you can whiff punish people with it and if you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sick, you hit him and then you do a combo and you kill him with a move that kind of shouldn't exist. &gt;&gt; And that is what I think I play Street Fighter for in a way. &gt;&gt; So you want to know what what my max dopamine moment is in Counterstrike? It's I think genuinely it's when it's when I call an a split on Mirage like three mid, two ramp ramp people wait to push out. We throw two smokes down mid and we pinch with perfect util and we take the site and we win the round. That's the highest ever. &gt;&gt; I just I just I just cracked your whole ego, man. That's &gt;&gt; I got your full download, Aiden. &gt;&gt; That's the greatest feeling in the world because it's like &gt;&gt; So the greatest feeling in the world is being listened to and you want to be No, no, no, no. Because if we could do it without me saying anything, that would also be great. It's the It's the idea of everyone understanding their position and role and us like fully executing the full potential of the game in that moment as a team. &gt;&gt; He's toing in Counter Strike. &gt;&gt; Oh my god, you're you're hitting all the power strips on all the stations. &gt;&gt; He doesn't need the credit. He just wants it all to work out. He wants he wants the system to portion and he wants everyone to have fun. He wants to be with his friends in particular. &gt;&gt; Actually, I can synthesize it. I can synthesize it into the perfect into the perfect moment. There was a the because me and Yingling played so much Valerant together and I think there's a lot of we were we were forged in the fires of of Dawson coaching and we both learned the game in a very similar way and as a result we do things when it's just us two without having to talk about everything which is really cool and we do like so the there will be a moment where like we're on opposite sides of a fight and we don't have to say anything and like he swings shoots pulling that guy's attention and then I swing and get the And it's like and that's max dopamine. It's like we played it &gt;&gt; nonverbal like soul link &gt;&gt; and and we played it perfectly and it's and it's no one had to have amazing aim for that to happen. No one needed the headsh shot. It was because we executed like a perfect team play in that moment. That is so hard to get with a solo Q teammate. But because we were forging the fires together, &gt;&gt; come out on top. &gt;&gt; I love the fires for you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The fires are where you belong. &gt;&gt; That's what that's what I want. &gt;&gt; I've been stressed out. What's wrong, man? &gt;&gt; What's right? What's wrong? &gt;&gt; Slowwig said I need to start watching One Piece and he got so into it and I was like, I gotta impress my friend. I gotta start eating gum gum fruits. &gt;&gt; You're eating only gum gum fruits. &gt;&gt; I'm at home and I try to I don't but there's no recipes for gum gum fruits. So, I'm try every meal I'm trying to make the fruit in my kitchen. It's just filled. It's filled with random things from my from my fridge and my cabinets that I slap with gum together. I'm not eating. That sounds funny. Do you realize that planning your meals can be simple and stress free? Do you realize that? &gt;&gt; Yeah. You don't have to try to make gum gum fruit. No. &gt;&gt; How else How else do I get my &gt;&gt; You can use You can use Hungry Root, Aiden. You know, last week, Hungry Root sent us some food, and I tried some of it. You know what they sent us?

What do I still have to build it from the things in my kitchen? &gt;&gt; No, you don't have to build. They send it to you. And you just you just get to do it. &gt;&gt; Understanding. Yeah. We also have had the flame and tasted like it was straight from Fleming's the restaurant. It was delicious. Uh I couldn't make a steak like that if I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I like the chili. &gt;&gt; Sounds like it would take It sounds like it would take a long time. &gt;&gt; It wouldn't take a long time.

Let's get back to the episode where he's magically going to show up in this uh chair that he has an ass indent in. &gt;&gt; His is Cammy. &gt;&gt; I feel like you It's when you land three coin flips in a row &gt;&gt; and you're like, "Yes, &gt;&gt; the coin flips feel fun, but I I I have been more disciplined these days in this world." For instance, that crouching medium punch with punish is not a coin flip. That is a calculated like landing of a move that is actually pretty safe and if I hit it, I'm a spacing god. So, I've been I've been more precision maxing these days and caring if I like play better. &gt;&gt; Four years ago, it was swinging in front of your cipher trip and somehow killing four people. &gt;&gt; And that when you describe it like that, it sounds pretty good. &gt;&gt; You You just want to like And when you played Valerant, you'd put yourself in the worst positions cuz if you hit the flick, it was like &gt;&gt; Yeah. It was so juicive. It was so juicy. Dude, why did that game fall off? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Me and Lover. Why did Valerant fell off? I mean, you've been following it so closely. &gt;&gt; So massive, man. &gt;&gt; I think it was our documentary. &gt;&gt; You think so? &gt;&gt; I think it's finally Super TF watched it on stream. I think it's it's finally hitting the algorithm. &gt;&gt; It tainted the Valerant pool. &gt;&gt; Yep. People found out Losers Q is real. &gt;&gt; They were like, "Why the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are we playing this game as losers Q? Watch this documentary I saw. It's on this lowkey website right &gt;&gt; like just watch the documentary, bro. It says everything. They need to get this this conspiracy far along enough that they have to YouTube community notes that video. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I I love Big Shoot. I I met someone who uh said they worked at Riot and I was like, "Have you seen our documentary? Was it in the Slack?" And she was like, "What are you talking about?" &gt;&gt; Oh my god, bro. &gt;&gt; I was like, "Never mind. I'm sorry, &gt;&gt; dude. I I have I've been playing normal. I just I really want to game these days." And so it's mostly what I do and I play normals and I might get chatb before the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] grace of gold is over cuz they do not like what I say for some reason. Riot I've tried to be creative. I've said that basically my jungler I'll be like my jungler [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] his sister. What do you want me to do? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Wait, pause. &gt;&gt; Where did you really put your creative input there? Where where do you think you influence that the most? &gt;&gt; What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; When you say you want to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] your sister, what's the you said I want I be creative. I try to be creative instead of saying like child molester. &gt;&gt; He try he's trying to be creative in the sense that he's trying to find new ways to insult that aren't &gt;&gt; you're trying to hold Hold on. You're flying too close to the sun. You're not like It's not surprising that you would be banned. You're trying to get around the sensor. &gt;&gt; I'm not Yeah. &gt;&gt; You thought sister [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] was going to dodge the sensor. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, it has so far. &gt;&gt; You want You want something that cuts through the sensor but is also extremely hurtful. Still &gt;&gt; hurt some guy. Dude, oh my god. I was a guy in my normal with Zeke cuz he was just doing so bad. And I was like, I know it's a normal, but Jesus Christ, it is so unlucky to be playing with you. It sucks. And and I but and then I was like, but I guess that's also how league works. Sometimes you get you and sometimes the other team doesn't get you. And then the guy who was like playing Yaso, he was like, this isn't very nice. And I was like, I'm not trying to be nice. This is this is I had this thought last week when we were describing the things you'd been saying in League Jet because when you log on to League and you play, people say horrific things in the chat and you and they and they do terrible things and they and they you know there's an array of awful League teammates that we only see through the champion and not the person on the other end. &gt;&gt; And it's very interesting because in the past two weeks I've realized that you're the one of the guys. You're one of the guys that people log on and then talk about after. &gt;&gt; Only sometimes. I think I think one, but it only has to be sometimes for you to be the guy. &gt;&gt; I'm okay with cuz cuz we're all the guy sometimes. &gt;&gt; One hijack makes you a terrorist. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we're all typers and I'm okay with that cuz most of the time I deafen. &gt;&gt; I am never a typer. &gt;&gt; I don't have all chat on. I think that's I think that's cap because when you stream to people when you were grinding a bunch of League and you would literally tell your your chatters to kill themselves. That's a way of that's typing. That's typing. Like that's a way of doing that. &gt;&gt; But the people who logged in to play League had a great experience. That chatter who said why did you flash there may might have had a bad one. &gt;&gt; But you're also saying this to the people on your team without them knowing even though you're being broadcasted. &gt;&gt; Why can't you do that? Why can't you be in the shower talking about I'm not saying you can't, but that's typing. &gt;&gt; I think he he's trying to pull us in. He's trying to whirlpool us into this. All three of us are nothing like you. &gt;&gt; What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; Three of us are nothing like you. &gt;&gt; What are you? I'm not &gt;&gt; What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; I hear you. I hear you have arguments on [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 40minute arguments on his arguments. Mine &gt;&gt; are so much different. &gt;&gt; Justice of like a call not being listened to. &gt;&gt; No. And also I don't I don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't flame the people who like don't listen to the call. I like wait for somebody to get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of pocket and I'm like, "You can't." And then I argue with them. &gt;&gt; And you're And you're like, "Sister [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] said what?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; No, I say sister [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] when things go wrong. I don't say it right away. When when we're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] when the game starts falling apart, I'm like, "I'm just stay quiet. Stay quiet. Stay quiet." And then [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] goes [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] really bad and I'm like, "You know what? It's sister [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] time." &gt;&gt; That's not what happens. &gt;&gt; It is. I'm being misrepresented. &gt;&gt; Like the thing like it's corroborate. you. It's It's not when things are going really wrong. It's when you think they're going wrong, which is so different in terms of time. Not true. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. You give up so much earlier than it's actually done. &gt;&gt; No smile. &gt;&gt; Time loses tier one tower. Guess the game's over. Guess the whole game's over. I guess it's going to cascade into a beautiful &gt;&gt; play and I don't flame. &gt;&gt; But when No, you do flame and you stop playing. &gt;&gt; No, I don't. &gt;&gt; Yes, you do. &gt;&gt; I I'm being misrepresented. I said this before on stream. I actually agree because I watched a few moments in your last stream where you were getting so mad at random [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like in your chat or like your teammates or whatever and you would just perma look at chat, walk down mid, get into a fight because you walking forward and then die and you'd be like and then I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] died. So now you're banned. &gt;&gt; Uh that happened like once or twice. &gt;&gt; This is your journey. &gt;&gt; It doesn't happen a lot. &gt;&gt; This is your journey. It didn't affect me, but I've talked to many people about your journey cuz cuz they bring it up and and at basketball they brought it up and what nobody ever says is, "Yeah, Volar is pretty good in lane." They bring up consistently the way you communicate with people and how angry you get. &gt;&gt; This is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Atri, it's not me. Atriox comes to basketball and he goes, he goes, "Yeah, I watched slime. He said he was going to be nicer today and then he just kept calling everyone sister fuckers." I said that like twice. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Also, I said I was going to be nicer to chat. This is &gt;&gt; But you also weren't though. &gt;&gt; Uh, I was way nicer than I was the day before. There's a there is a mischaracterization. &gt;&gt; Terrorist downgrades. &gt;&gt; There's a mischaracterization that happens that I am a spiny guy and I get mad and this and that. And when I improve, I still get painted as the same like hideous [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] evil monster, which also I don't think is even that bad compared to most people that play this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] awful game. &gt;&gt; Do you think you are not a spiny guy who gets mad? &gt;&gt; Uh, &gt;&gt; you said mischaracterizing. &gt;&gt; No, I am. But I think the the severity of which that gets sort of like I don't know amplified specifically on this show, which is fine. and it's a show is is a mischaracterization &gt;&gt; that ends up like leaking into the real life. It's like &gt;&gt; I think people I think you believe people should not count your extreme moments because they don't they don't represent the average. But I think the extreme moments are what people remember. &gt;&gt; I agree for what it's worth. I almost 100% agree with you. I I I think I think you're actually totally right. People take a enhanced idea of your character that is heavily perpetuated through the show. &gt;&gt; But I agree with this too. But you take an enhanced defense of your character. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Someone's got to defend me because no one else is &gt;&gt; the guy, you know, the guy you did a sprint interview with and he was like, "This is this is a psychotic human being." It's crazy. &gt;&gt; It's crazy that that guy exists. &gt;&gt; He's on the opposite side of the prison yard from you, but you're still in the prison yard. &gt;&gt; That's crazy. &gt;&gt; Actually, let's go. &gt;&gt; That's crazy. Let's go now. Let's go. &gt;&gt; And honestly, if I'm being honest, the three of us are on the outside of the fence looking at him. &gt;&gt; Yes, very much so. &gt;&gt; I don't. &gt;&gt; He's a good boy. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; Mr. Kill yourself in chat. &gt;&gt; He was so fast. No, this is different. This is different. &gt;&gt; Okay, it's different. Different. &gt;&gt; Let's just try. We can put him on trial. &gt;&gt; Different. &gt;&gt; What is What is your baby? No, baby. No. Excuse me. Six six years older up. &gt;&gt; What is your idea of yourself? Like if that guy you did the sprint interview with who is just a genuine psychotic person is like you know the far [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right evil most you know top 0001% &gt;&gt; to be clear that guy is not like you. I'm saying in in in like &gt;&gt; they're not like us. &gt;&gt; They not like us. &gt;&gt; In this gradient, he's in the top 0001% of like evil people on League. And then like you know all the way over here like the sweetest angel on League of Legends with no &gt;&gt; nicest person ever. &gt;&gt; Plus they just play the game. They love it. They [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up vote. They communicate well. &gt;&gt; If you look at all the data and I'm going to get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] clown for this. &gt;&gt; Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. And I just want I just want to know the percentile of evil. if you look at the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] data including the highs and the lows and also that I'm willing to admit mistakes publicly and personally &gt;&gt; and I would love to include that &gt;&gt; because because I think that's a big problem with a lot of people. &gt;&gt; So many people won't even admit it. &gt;&gt; You're right. You're right. A lot of people won't back down and you back down sometimes. &gt;&gt; I'm right in the middle. &gt;&gt; You are the top 50% of evil. So you're average. &gt;&gt; Average. &gt;&gt; You're average. Most people would boot up the game and have like a again just a good time learning the game, trying their best. &gt;&gt; That's not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] true. That is not true. That's not how people play this game. They log on, they go insane. &gt;&gt; No, this is from bad to this is the bias of the people you notice. &gt;&gt; The average person, I would say, boots up the game and just tries to play it and have a good time. I think it's average person. &gt;&gt; Three people in chat talk to each other and the other the rest of them say that's a good point. &gt;&gt; I think most people don't type, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah, most people don't. Typers are the ones we remember. &gt;&gt; So maybe it's a little higher than that. &gt;&gt; I'm 50%. I don't know. &gt;&gt; Still 50%. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. Okay. &gt;&gt; Because because you're taking my typing for like he types every single day. &gt;&gt; I'm going to blow your mind right now. I'm going to blow your mind. This the same thing that you're doing with chat where you go those are the people you remember. That's what people are doing with you. &gt;&gt; I know. But &gt;&gt; your most extreme moments. Those are the three chatters. &gt;&gt; And that's okay. I'm just here to set the record straight for those who wish to listen for two seconds. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's all I want to do. &gt;&gt; Those who are willing to open their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] minds. Those are willing to just watch a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 10-minute video where we [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] talk to the people at Riot and we've kind of found something out &gt;&gt; and it's not what you think it is. It's not a place that operates business like you thought it did. &gt;&gt; Redoing the video, but for League I thought about that the other day, &gt;&gt; but I'm like the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I I think we brought this up last year, but it's like I'm the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up Bojack who's like insane looking. Like I it's like there's Valer It and then there's like League Despair where I'm just like yeah &gt;&gt; I thought it I thought it'd be funny if we like shot another one. It was about League, but I was more like Slime has somehow convinced me to drink the Kool-Aid now. I'm not like the straight man. So he's fully crazy, but I'm ining and getting mad and mad at the game and whatever. And you're like the sage like I told you. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; I told you. And then and then we we both go with a mission that I end up sobered like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] am I doing? Why am I hanging out with &gt;&gt; I'm like firm and supreme. I got like neck tattoos and I look like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Rick Rubin. &gt;&gt; We actually do like like like there's Easter eggs and we cross by a room with candles lit in a circle that we don't see. And like there we hint that there is something greater, but we don't even discover it. Like I had this whole I was thinking about all this the other day. &gt;&gt; Oh god. &gt;&gt; Uh I made Nick [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] jealous. &gt;&gt; Jealous? &gt;&gt; I made [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] jealous [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] jealous. You guys had an adventure. &gt;&gt; He got to be your pipe on the trip. &gt;&gt; I don't know what he's talking about. Apparently in New York this week, it's New York fashion week &gt;&gt; and and we're &gt;&gt; Wait, how is you're going to rake with this story? &gt;&gt; And we were walking outside the hotel. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the bellhop, we're leaving some of our luggage with the bellhop goes, "You guys look great. &gt;&gt; You guys have great outfits on. &gt;&gt; Thought we were a gay couple. &gt;&gt; You look great." &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Was the bellhop? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; No. No. He's just being very He's giving it, you know, men never hear a compliment until it's on their deathbed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But what I found is that gay men or I guess sort of openly gay men are much more willing to be like compliment you. Which is always a nice thing. &gt;&gt; He could have been gay or closet. &gt;&gt; You know what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; He could have been. He could have been too. &gt;&gt; They're like, &gt;&gt; but he was like, "You guys look great." And then, you know, Nick right after this interaction, &gt;&gt; we the guy's the guy's no longer here. &gt;&gt; Yeah, the guy's no longer here. He turns to me and he goes, he was talking about me. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; He does that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] little ass. &gt;&gt; I literally was like, "You're a charity case. You got you got included in my outfit. &gt;&gt; And and and by the way, I have that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on. Like I'm wearing a wife beater. &gt;&gt; You never have that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on. I'll tell you exactly. &gt;&gt; I I know my outfit. Wife beater with a Lakers Gap uh jean jacket. &gt;&gt; I'm wearing shorts. Shorts. Basketball shorts. I'm wearing a fanny pack. &gt;&gt; Mid fanny pack. This fanny pack. Midcfe Nike socks with the Mellos. &gt;&gt; Mellas. &gt;&gt; Mason Marllas. &gt;&gt; Okay. And and I got that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on and he's wearing the same [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] shorts. &gt;&gt; Basically the same outfit except a new shirt and not these shoes. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And and so then and so then he says he says mean little [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] com this mean little comment. &gt;&gt; Nasty. &gt;&gt; And so then we go to a store shopping at a store &gt;&gt; completely far away from this place. &gt;&gt; Far away from this place. And I and I'm looking for a belt. And Nick goes up to this this woman who works here. He goes, "Hey, we're looking for belts." And then and then she's like, "Oh yeah, it's this way." And then and then she stops and she goes, "Wow, you guys look great." And then the other store associate, two people, two people go, "Yeah, you guys have great outfits." Like the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is going on? &gt;&gt; They're like, "You got that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on." And we're like, "Oh my god, thank you." Like, "What the hell?" &gt;&gt; And so, like, he was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he was trying to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] take this away from me, but three people vouched that I had that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on. Like, I know how to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] style myself. &gt;&gt; I just There's a there's a next part of the story. &gt;&gt; No, it's the end of the story. So we So we keep walking and bless this nice associate. She's trying to help us out. I go, &gt;&gt; but if you had to pick one. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; But if you had to pick one and she goes, &gt;&gt; then she points at me. She's like, I mean, I got to go. &gt;&gt; How does that feel? &gt;&gt; She took a long time to think about it. And then she and then she said right after, "But I like what you're doing with the Nike socks and the Melas." &gt;&gt; Oh, that feels good. That that when she looked over, but that's nice. That feels good, too. &gt;&gt; And then after the interaction, Len's like, "Fuck was that?" And I'm like, "I just had to show you. You're getting lumped in. &gt;&gt; I'm not getting lumped in. You walk into the store alone. I don't know if they're going to be like, "Bro, you got that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on." &gt;&gt; It's basically It's basically like like, "Who's the best player in the Dodgers?" And she was like, "I got to go show, but like Freddy Freeman looks [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] great out there." &gt;&gt; Yeah, you're Freddy Freeman. &gt;&gt; I'm okay with being Freddy Freeman. &gt;&gt; Yeah, only cuz you're not show. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? You have to take that. You're a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You're a little [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for that. But for that, &gt;&gt; to Logan's credit, his point is not I had that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on. His point is, why take it away from me? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Why take out? You know what? He's right. &gt;&gt; No. No. There's an answer because it's hilarious. &gt;&gt; Because usually you guys say that I have bad outfits, which today I'm crushing. Usually you guys say I have bad outfits. And so like I'm trying to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] prove to you that regular ass people look at what I've put on and they go, "Damn." &gt;&gt; I don't If you were dog ass ugly, a lot of this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you do and say would not fly. &gt;&gt; No one says damn to you, bro. And you're mad about it. &gt;&gt; And I'm on the team. I'm Freddy Freeman. &gt;&gt; You're not Freddy Freeman. I'm uh I'm like a guy in the office. &gt;&gt; I'm the guy like phoning in New York to see if that play was was good. &gt;&gt; I'm in the paper. &gt;&gt; I'm not in the paper. &gt;&gt; I'm in the paper. &gt;&gt; Dude, we we were walking down the street and there was an ad for the paper. We saw something. We were talking about the paper and we were me and I was doing a bit where I was like, "Well, me and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Anthony are going to be famous soon because we acted with Eric Rahill who's in the paper and and our project's going to come out after the paper. So, he'll already be a mega celebrity." And then we walk by a billboard for the paper and L's like, "Oh, which one is he?" And it's just everyone in the show besides Eric Rahill. He just didn't make the poster. And we're I'm looking at it. I'm like, &gt;&gt; "So bad for us." &gt;&gt; Like, "Yeah, he's not on the he's not on it." Like, "No, he's not on it." &gt;&gt; The guy in season two, &gt;&gt; not even on it. &gt;&gt; Well, the season two posters like really work cuz the show will be bigger. That's when it pops. &gt;&gt; Show will be bigger. So, season two poster is probably where you want to be. Really? &gt;&gt; I don't care about season one poster. I was doing a bit this weekend in my head which was uh &gt;&gt; Okay, sorry. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do you want? &gt;&gt; Doing a bit in my head this weekend. &gt;&gt; What do you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] want? What do you think I do with my time? &gt;&gt; This is a crazy start to end. &gt;&gt; It's a crazy start. I wear [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all day and but no one says anything. &gt;&gt; Oh, we're being hurtful today. We're being hurtful. &gt;&gt; You started a sentence. I was doing a bit in my head. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Do you not do bits in your head? &gt;&gt; I mean like Yeah, but I've never started a sentence like that ever. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, I guess you do. You were saying you don't you don't like be honest. &gt;&gt; That's not what I said. &gt;&gt; It's like I was like I was taking a dump today. You're like, "Were you taking a dump?" It's like we all take dumps. &gt;&gt; It's I'm just brave. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, you're you're brave for this. &gt;&gt; So, I'm bravely doing a bit in my head where it's like a guy who is a ventriloquist who wants to kill himself. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good. &gt;&gt; He's like, "Oh my god. Oh my god, I'm so sad. I'm going to till myself. &gt;&gt; Is this not the bar for bar the Caleb Pits bit? &gt;&gt; It's the same voice. But but yeah, he he can only communicate through the puppet and he said he's like does it in front of the audience. He's like, "Do you ever feel like you're alone in the universe?" &gt;&gt; Do do you guys Maybe we should take like each week it's like one of our turns to take him on a walk. &gt;&gt; What is that about? &gt;&gt; I don't need a walk. that call. &gt;&gt; The crushing weight of my reality is crushing down on my brain. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. Nothing feels nice anymore. &gt;&gt; None of the SSRI are doing anything for my mental state. &gt;&gt; I'll do first shift. &gt;&gt; I'll do Thursday. &gt;&gt; We can hang out this week. Don't worry. &gt;&gt; Everything that I like to detour doesn't make me feel good anymore. &gt;&gt; Gez, Amed, you sound pretty sad. I am so terribly sad. &gt;&gt; Peanut, I am being serious. This is a cry for a felt. &gt;&gt; See, see, that's what he does. That's what Slatt does. Okay, &gt;&gt; Slatt. &gt;&gt; He He backs me up. You don't back me up. You don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] back me up in the Salesforce Lamborghini, &gt;&gt; which I put sugar in the gas tank, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's safe for that to happen. &gt;&gt; I bricked it. &gt;&gt; I'm done with it anyway, man. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm sure Salesforce Lamborghinis are gone. &gt;&gt; All the all the happiness from getting it is gone now. &gt;&gt; Lemonade stands in the New York Times. You know that. &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; They got mentioned in the New York Times cuz they talked to that fired woman. &gt;&gt; How do you How do you How do you &gt;&gt; You did talk to an unemployed woman at &gt;&gt; that. Damn neat. &gt;&gt; Damn neat. She's a teacher, bro. &gt;&gt; I just don't know what to do without my jaw anymore. &gt;&gt; It's okay, Lena. &gt;&gt; Come on. The lemonade sand. &gt;&gt; If it makes you feel better, this is good news for us. They're falling off drastically. &gt;&gt; They're falling off &gt;&gt; drastically. Yes. Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; Lemonade sand is falling off the face of the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] earth. Falling off. &gt;&gt; Uh oh. You're not falling off. We can [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pull up the numbers. We can pull up the numbers. &gt;&gt; Pull our damn numbers. We're falling off, too. &gt;&gt; Why? I heard you talking to Atriog about this yesterday. I I I'll &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; It could be It could be us falling off. &gt;&gt; Why do you think that's happening? &gt;&gt; But why is it happening to a bunch of people at the same time? So, &gt;&gt; is it because Doug's HP? &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's the HP. &gt;&gt; Doug is sliding in one frame of HP in every episode. And if you sync up the episode &gt;&gt; cuz FaZe Rain went live talking about Doug. Doug, &gt;&gt; you lumped him in, man. &gt;&gt; And and he was there with FaZe Temper. &gt;&gt; Rain was there, bro. Rain has three rules. Doug talked to two 16-year-old chatbots. &gt;&gt; Range have three [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rules and that's all he follows. You got to respect that. No [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pedos, no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] animal abuse, and it's no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pedos again. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And also, I have a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] photographic memory, &gt;&gt; bro. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; he was saying. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Rain says he can remember everything he ever read. &gt;&gt; Nick says that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Nick says that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and he's wrong every time. &gt;&gt; What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; Nick, you talk about how good your memory is. &gt;&gt; I got the memory. &gt;&gt; It's kind of butt. &gt;&gt; What? It's falling off. &gt;&gt; Well, I believe that &gt;&gt; lemonade sand style. You I'm becoming your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; style. It's a very generic. &gt;&gt; I have a dope ass memory, but for the useless [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] not for arguments between friends, which is probably the most useful one. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, I don't think it's the most useful. I think it &gt;&gt; like like if it's a movie quote, I remember the intonation of syllables. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You you great with references. I'm terrible with references. You have you have a powerful brain for any piece of media you consume between the age of 0 and 18. &gt;&gt; Which is why if I frame our interactions as media, not a by the way, &gt;&gt; then I'm very much able to uh accurately photographically remember anything media that I watched and it's our conversations. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I have I would have to do that which I refuse to do because then that would prove all the people. &gt;&gt; Wait, here's my prediction and here's my question. PRS &gt;&gt; twofold prreds. &gt;&gt; Two prreds. What is this? face party. &gt;&gt; Let's go, man. &gt;&gt; Um, &gt;&gt; I have, you know, the first week I came to LA, he was the first celebrity I saw. &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; I feel the need to defend him. &gt;&gt; Was he was he at Pub? &gt;&gt; No, it was in Santa Monica and he was just going on a run. It was like It was like my second day after moving down and I was like, "Oh, I You must just see these people all the time." &gt;&gt; I have a problem recently where I can smell them through my jeans. &gt;&gt; Smell it through your jeans. I can smell them through my jeans. them. You're smelling them. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I can smell I can smell my own guys through my jeans. So, I I subscribe to this &gt;&gt; this delivery system monthly. It's about $700 a month and it's ball deodorant and it doesn't work. &gt;&gt; Doesn't work. You're still smelling them through the jeans. &gt;&gt; I smell them through the jeans. It doesn't change anything about &gt;&gt; How long have you been subscribed to the &gt;&gt; About 2 years. &gt;&gt; Two years, dude. That is $18,000 first try. That is $18,000. &gt;&gt; And I keep calling them and they say, &gt;&gt; "Well, how do you figure out it's that long?" At some point, you probably want to cancel it, &gt;&gt; dude. &gt;&gt; So, I don't know what to do, Bill. &gt;&gt; Can you shut up about your balls? Cuz I think you have an issue that money can't solve. &gt;&gt; But I have a solution for your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] funds, for your wallet. &gt;&gt; Okay. Sure. &gt;&gt; Okay. I think it's called Rocket Money. Oh, right. Maybe if he had Rocket Money, he would have found out he had an unwanted subscription because it doesn't work because the smell. Well, I'll also call them up and I can't cancel. They won't let me cancel. &gt;&gt; You said what is it? It's a personal finance app that finds and cancels your unwanted subscriptions, monitors your spending, and helps lowers your bill so you can grow your savings. &gt;&gt; They say the the smell doesn't go away when I call. They say the smell will never disappear, lovely. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. You can't see all your subscriptions in one place, Nick. And the dashboard gives you a clear view of your expenses across all accounts. You can get alerts if your bills increased. &gt;&gt; And the smell is starting to show as a color. &gt;&gt; This is &gt;&gt; like the jeans are changing color where the smell is from. I have yellow spots on my underwear. &gt;&gt; Guys, this is all making a lot of sense and that's why I check my credit score as often as I can cuz I want to make sure that goes up and the stink goes down. &gt;&gt; I didn't I didn't mention this. It is devastating my credit score cuz I am overdrafted to all get out. &gt;&gt; We go to the bank and they lowered my credit score cuz they smelled it through the glass. Three people have gross balls and 5 million people use Rocket Money to save over 500 million and cancel subscription. Save members up to 740 a year using the app's premium features. Anyway, I think I guess I'll download this thing, whatever it's called. Is it? &gt;&gt; Please do. We'll cancel your unwanted subscriptions. Reach your financial goals fast with Rocket Money by going to rockamoney.com/theyard. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Go to rockammoney.com/theyard. &gt;&gt; I guess I'll go to rockammoney.com/theyard. And do you smell that? You smell that? &gt;&gt; It smells like monster cheese. &gt;&gt; I couldn't finish. &gt;&gt; All right, we broke. We broke. Okay, we're we're ending the ad read. We ended right there. Go to rocketway.com. Just go to rocketmoney.com/theard. &gt;&gt; We got Faze Banks, left phase gone. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; We got PBM left phase [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] gone. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; We got Faze Temper. Who knows how this shit's going to shake out? Who knows how this shit's going to shake out? &gt;&gt; Who even knows? Rain, bro. Left phase [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like two and a half years ago. He's not even right. You got Jason. He's tweeting out old phase, new phase. Nah, not even [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bro. &gt;&gt; You got Lacy, &gt;&gt; bro. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] seeing, bro. &gt;&gt; You got Lacy like &gt;&gt; I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] saying, bro. Why are you so scared, Lacy? &gt;&gt; You got Lacy like this. He's like, &gt;&gt; okay. &gt;&gt; And then I think what's going to happen? &gt;&gt; I think all the new head youngans, they're going to leave and make their own org in this right moment. &gt;&gt; I thought this. They're going to start lit league or they're going to start [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they're going to start [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lit live. &gt;&gt; Lit League. I thought you said Lit League. &gt;&gt; We're taking it to Rumble, boys. we're going to Rumble and they're going to No, they're going to stay on Twitch, all that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but they're going to they're going to and they're going to take Beeps [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with them &gt;&gt; and they're going to go and they're going to start their own [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and they're going to be like, "It's this is the new [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bro." And then Banks is going to be like, "Lowkey, I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] put y'all on. This shit's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy that you would go like that." Banks would be like that cuz Banks put Banks actually [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] put Aiden on but didn't even mind when Aiden didn't join FaZe. &gt;&gt; He didn't. &gt;&gt; He didn't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mind. And he's got co Bro, Aiden Aiden [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stayed at the cloud. Bro, you can stay at the Cloud House as long as you want, bro. Like, if you're part of FaZe, that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dope. And I rock with that. I rock with you. &gt;&gt; I love when the FaZe guys are like, "Bro, from back when we were in [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] New York, I love when they sit like that. It's like, what? What? &gt;&gt; What?" &gt;&gt; Okay, so I was thinking this &gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Rancho Cukamonga. Back in Rancho, dog. &gt;&gt; I was thinking yes, they probably will. Like, it's probably a good idea, but if they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up the branding, it could fail so bad. Branding is everything. &gt;&gt; I don't I don't know if they'll I don't know if they'll do this, &gt;&gt; guys. &gt;&gt; The yard. &gt;&gt; I don't &gt;&gt; We create the or that all the &gt;&gt; Yo, we pick them up. We pick him up and then we have the old head podcast and this is we're like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Hector from Optic and we're like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] who's the old head of Faze. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And like Magi can go to more tournaments &gt;&gt; and and then this is instead of phase up it's like yo yard up. &gt;&gt; Do you like the idea bro? &gt;&gt; We get really big. We're signing. It's Lacy and it's Jason. But we still sign We signed Magi. &gt;&gt; Yeah, Magi still gets &gt;&gt; We signed Magi. That's our Spargo. &gt;&gt; We need We need We need &gt;&gt; We signed Magi before Ron. &gt;&gt; Yeah, low key. &gt;&gt; Of course. Of course, &gt;&gt; Ron. We're going to put you at the top of the stack. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; No, you'll be at the top of the stack. &gt;&gt; We have to reference the stack. You'll be at the top of the stack. But it's just not the right. &gt;&gt; It's just that she beat Mango at Genesis. &gt;&gt; Mango Genesis. It's not the right time. You know, &gt;&gt; here's what Matt Here's here. &gt;&gt; You spawn Ron. your spawn run. We haven't let the spawn all game &gt;&gt; for your pres. Here's what matters. Who owns phase? And I think right now &gt;&gt; Apex, &gt;&gt; it's an investment team. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; that is planning on giving it to banks if he pays like enough over time. Like I think they've loaned him, &gt;&gt; but he already left. &gt;&gt; He owned it. He never left. Bro, &gt;&gt; you're talking multi-level plan. You're talking he's pl he's already plotting the I bought Faze back. He I I'm saying like he never he owns the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Everyone says he left because I don't think he's like doing as much dayto-day. &gt;&gt; Dude, in his video he's like I left Faze like two weeks ago. Everyone knows that. He even said that recently, bro. He left and left it. &gt;&gt; Look at your phone there. &gt;&gt; I can call him. &gt;&gt; Is this a legend? &gt;&gt; I'll call F. &gt;&gt; Call. Did you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you calling face? &gt;&gt; Oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] It's Lacy. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Yeah. No. No. No. Hang up. Hang up. Hang up. Hang up. &gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; It's feeding time. Okay, &gt;&gt; dude. He actually lost a lot of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] weight and he looks [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] great. You look I'm jealous. &gt;&gt; He weighs less than you, bro. [Music] &gt;&gt; All right, let's take a look. &gt;&gt; Look at the horse. &gt;&gt; This is Lacy. &gt;&gt; Here's his bank. &gt;&gt; Lacy, you know they got plants versus zombies on the iPads at Olive Garden. &gt;&gt; Guys, we got to be quiet for this. He does not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with us like he [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with blood. &gt;&gt; It's crazy, man. You can just play versus zombies the whole time. You're at all guard now. You wait for your crispers and say [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Go for B. &gt;&gt; The [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is up? Go for B. &gt;&gt; You reach [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] face. &gt;&gt; You reached the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Trillis voicemail in the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] east. &gt;&gt; You're chopped. &gt;&gt; It just plays an &gt;&gt; You can't even get a phone. It is what it is. &gt;&gt; You can't even get a phone call back anymore. &gt;&gt; Uhoh. Okay, shut up now, bro. Yo, what up? &gt;&gt; Yo. &gt;&gt; Yo, I had a quick question. I'm on I'm on my pod right now. I was just wondering who owns Faze right now. &gt;&gt; Who owns Faze? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Like I forget how it works after it posts back. &gt;&gt; Well, it went private. Games Square bought it, took it private. Um or no, Games Square is a public company. Games Square bought um bought the company and then myself and a couple partners went and bought it back from Games Square and now at this point it's been um distributed throughout the company. Everybody at the company right now I believe owns shares. All the members own shares. Um &gt;&gt; the members of like actual phase. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. Okay. So that makes sense. So it's like y'all own it. So it's back to y'all. Well, y'all y'all using y'all lightly there. I I stepped away from Faze recently and I'm kind of on my own [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right now. &gt;&gt; Oh, you dead you gave up your ownership, too? &gt;&gt; Well, no, not necessarily. It's a little bit more complicated than that. It's not like a one day process, you know? I'm kind of figuring out what the next steps for my own personal life are right now. But &gt;&gt; yeah, what you going to do? &gt;&gt; Um, &gt;&gt; yeah. &gt;&gt; Aren't you phased till death? &gt;&gt; I don't know. Brother, this whole thing's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] at this point for me. And I feel like I'm I feel like I'm getting every possible sign a human being could get from the universe to just like go a different way in my life. I don't know. I have a very toxic relationship with this thing, man. It's very emotional for me. Um I did always feel like it was for life, but I don't know. Like I find myself over and over and over in every rendition of this thing in every era of phase like I just like I'll put this before myself before my sanity before my health like and it's just like I don't know and it always comes full circle and I'll always wind up feeling like unfulfilled or it's just you know what I mean it's it's not I don't have a professional relationship with FaZe it's a very personal emotional relationship like it's a family type of thing and it's just it's toxic. sick. &gt;&gt; Yeah. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] man. &gt;&gt; I don't know. It's heavy. It's heavy. &gt;&gt; I'm on a whole new like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] path in my life. I've been sober. I'm trying to be healthy and I'm just like trying to focus on [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that actually brings me joy and I find [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fulfillment and and purpose and and it's just I don't know if necessarily this is it anymore. My whole goal with FA and it's not doesn't need to be like this grim [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] super sad thing. My whole goal with FaZe and this new rendition of FaZe, this new this new chapter was to just simply bring the brand back. It just felt like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] The brand was dead. The life got sucked out of it. Um, you know, we got [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we made a bunch of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] horrible people rich and we got left holding a bag and all got [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] over. It just felt really bad and it would have continued to feel bad for the rest of my life if you know I didn't at least try to like do something with it, you And I think the new guys, I think I've properly passed the baton off to the new guys and it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cool again and it belongs to them. And that's another that's a whole another thing. I don't know if necessarily, you know, my my interests and and and what I'm I'm into and who I am aligns with this new this new phase [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you know? &gt;&gt; But it's in a good spot now where you could leave it and not feel bad about it. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. Like I feel like I feel like in a lot of ways my job is done. like and and honestly, dude, I thought it would take a lot longer than it did to bring it back to where it's at. &gt;&gt; The plan was, you know, two, three years. Yeah. Was &gt;&gt; that's what I'm saying. It was It was fast. And I'm really really proud of the spot it's in. And I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I love the guys and and they're killing it. And I love what FaZe is right now, but it's not it's just not I I'm not sure that it's for me anymore, you know? Which is okay. Like that's fine. It's better than what it was &gt;&gt; and I'm I'm gonna feel better about it than I what I would have felt about it. You know what I mean? If that makes sense. &gt;&gt; No, it makes sense. That's that's a lot of introspection. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I didn't want to go through the rest of my life [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what if, would I have, could have, should have. So, took a took a stab at bringing it back and I think we did a good job. I think the job is done. &gt;&gt; I think that makes sense. All right. Yeah. I I just wasn't sure how it worked, but that that makes sense. But it seems like you've been thinking about it a lot. &gt;&gt; Yeah, of course. I mean, this is my whole life, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'm not gonna [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] just die and just It's not rain and I'm not There's no disdain. There's no like bad blood or anything. Of course, I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'll always want this to do well and to when I'll always be the biggest fan, you know? &gt;&gt; Yeah. You don't have to put your time into it like you used to. &gt;&gt; That's what it is, man. It's the times the 247 versus like focusing on other [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; We're 30 plus. Yeah, we might as well be dead. That's another thing, too. Everybody [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Why Why does everybody Why does everybody on Twitter hate old people? &gt;&gt; Uh because it's it's not for the old anymore. All right, we're supposed to be moved on to &gt;&gt; I don't know what old people Fox News and golf rounds. &gt;&gt; Do you have a Do you have a Do you have a kid? &gt;&gt; Do I have a I don't have a kid? No, I don't have a kid yet. &gt;&gt; Learn how to play golf. I &gt;&gt; If we both get kids, we can teach him to be golfers. I would love my kid to rival yours. &gt;&gt; I feel like I might have a kid somewhere. I think you might have a kid somewhere, too. &gt;&gt; Maybe. All right, I'll let you go. &gt;&gt; All right, brother. Appreciate you. &gt;&gt; Hit me anytime. Of course. Peace. &gt;&gt; First of all, damn, that was pretty moving. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that was pretty touching. &gt;&gt; That was introspectful. &gt;&gt; Second of all, we're on Fearbuck right now. So, everybody, hey, the timeline on &gt;&gt; What's up, fearbuck [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Third, my impression is pretty good. You're dude. I the whole time I'm talking I'm just thinking about how good your impression is. &gt;&gt; It's pretty grappling with the idea of being in his 30s and be like, I just don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] get this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] anymore. I'm like, welcome, bro. Welcome. &gt;&gt; People from FaZe ownership come on the pod and just get really vulnerable about what what it means to them. &gt;&gt; You know what that is? That's an LS bit. You should bring those [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on LS and talk &gt;&gt; business &gt;&gt; and talk [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] business. That's actually not a bad idea. I know, right? I was thinking that. I was also thinking while Banks was saying all that word for word, all of that being said to somebody on a phone call, but it's Aiden talking about Lemonade Stand 10 years from now. &gt;&gt; Dude, bro, I'm too old for this, man. It's like &gt;&gt; the new guys, they're great. It's like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; And the new like Doug Dougshaped robot that he coded to replace him on the show. I don't bond with it. Like in the same way I don't I don't get it cuz I'm bringing back HP which is what we used to do. Nowadays they're saying HP's out. &gt;&gt; I like how he said we made a bunch of horrible people rich. I think they're really interesting. &gt;&gt; They really did. &gt;&gt; Dude, the more I learned about that story actually facts. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; the story phase is crazy. &gt;&gt; Uh it is crazy. It's still around cuz I was thinking it is probably more popular now than it's ever been ever. &gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely. And I think the people who like the new phase, like Jason doing the new phase, old phase, like the fans of the new phase don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for the most part about the old one. And I think almost vice versa. There there's more overlap of of old and the new. But the old people who like old phase are like people holding clinging on to like nostalgia of middle school &gt;&gt; and also not consuming content like that. &gt;&gt; We have to ask ourselves what does a brand a legacy brand really give you? And it's just for people who are passing by. I think to be like, I remember that and that's it. And not necessarily even in a nostalgic way. I think about this a lot with Street Fighter. Street Fighter could be a different game with different characters, same mechanics, same everything, but it doesn't have Rio in it. It's not &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I don't think it's just like I remember that. I think it's like this thing that was important to me for a long time is still important and that makes me feel good. &gt;&gt; It's like not it's not an evaporated era of my life that I'll never even touch again. And it's like I still get to almost LAR as if I'm still kind of in that happy place of my life. When I was a kid and I was watching Call of Duty and playing with my friends and like people still care about this thing, &gt;&gt; but is it is it so is it now such a different idea where it's like you see FaZe Lacy playing Minecraft with Marlin and you're like this isn't a trick shot. Like where is &gt;&gt; I think it's just morphed. I think it's like like when Kai goes live with Mafiaon and it's just a sleepover with his friends. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's like people kids are watching just like that's the coolest [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ever. These guys are rich and they're hanging out with their friends just like I do. I want to be like that. Me and my friends should be lit like this. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; we should make a Call of Duty team. We should trick shot. Like it's all the same bones. It's just like more relatable to more people now because it's IRL instead of &gt;&gt; instead of &gt;&gt; trapped inside of a single video game &gt;&gt; which is Call of Duty. &gt;&gt; So I think it's just bigger. &gt;&gt; I mean when Lacy makes a shot like that at the party that's just magic. &gt;&gt; And you're like maybe he wasn't clip farming. Maybe he's just like that. &gt;&gt; He's just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that. &gt;&gt; You gota You gota wonder maybe all of Adapts are first try. Like if they're really first trying these the parties in front of all those [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] witnesses. Like Adapt's probably first trying that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] every time, man. &gt;&gt; Dude, his I see clips from his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] his streams which is it's constantly just him getting like scared of Legos or like thinking about animals. Yeah. Or like he he has this like wonder to him or there was an Amber Alert on his phone and he grabbed a motorcycle helmet. He's like, "We got to do something." Like he he is a very a subtle clip farmer. &gt;&gt; Have you Have you seen the uh the the compilation of him like being magic? &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; dude. Let me see if I can find it. Keep going. I I'll send it to Zipper. &gt;&gt; This is the hot dogs. &gt;&gt; Uh that's that's some of them. Yeah. Um &gt;&gt; speaking of hot dogs, &gt;&gt; I think you're talking about adapt inventory spawns. &gt;&gt; Speaking of hot dogs, do you want to apologize to me? &gt;&gt; Bro, we talked about this on the pod. &gt;&gt; On the pod? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I thought we did it on your stream only. Oh, maybe &gt;&gt; it was just your stream. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm sorry, I guess. &gt;&gt; So, it's &gt;&gt; Sorry for what? &gt;&gt; It's like I wasn't even there for it, so does it count? &gt;&gt; Sorry, I guess. &gt;&gt; Do you remember on the primo when you said, "We're not even in the same conversation." &gt;&gt; You said it with so much conviction. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I just You know, you &gt;&gt; I It was the best of my era. You're the best of your era. Like, some people will think Jordan's the goat. Some people think LeBron's the goat. It's fine. &gt;&gt; You're the Michael Jordan. I'm LeBron, right? &gt;&gt; Yes. I was better than &gt;&gt; the middle of the road hot dog. &gt;&gt; I was the goat before you got to this. And then now the new era is different. &gt;&gt; It's different. &gt;&gt; I'm not as into it anymore. &gt;&gt; The game's just changed. &gt;&gt; The game has changed a lot. It's a very defensive game now. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Are we doing a hot dog run at past 50 or is it too dangerous? &gt;&gt; Uh, no, it's not too dangerous. &gt;&gt; Another Lwig event. Another tragedy. &gt;&gt; Okay. The hot dog 100 meter dash is not going to be a tragedy. &gt;&gt; I I think if if someone eats a hot dog and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dies and chokes on camera, that's bad. It won't be me cuz it'll be in my &gt;&gt; winner related tragedy strikes mogul moves again this year at the Lewig Fast 52 event. &gt;&gt; We're going to have medics on site. Okay. And we're going to we're going to have trained professionals only &gt;&gt; train like myself. &gt;&gt; This is the adapt pulling from his inventory moments. Dude, these actually are so good. They kill me. &gt;&gt; And he spawns a hot dog that he starts eating. &gt;&gt; I think we'll be able to figure it out, bro. Not bad at all. &gt;&gt; The [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Where did you get that from? &gt;&gt; Start here. &gt;&gt; What are they building? &gt;&gt; I like that. Safety first. &gt;&gt; Like a piece of that, &gt;&gt; bro. I want a Spider-Man suit so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bad. If I get like a sign. Toby McGuire is my favorite Spider-Man, though. &gt;&gt; You know Lacy's piss is not his, too. &gt;&gt; Dude, leave the guy alone. &gt;&gt; He looks great, man. We got We got him crazy. &gt;&gt; He's been [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] losing hell away. Yeah, he's great, man. Where the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] am I? I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 30. &gt;&gt; Charles Barkley's doing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Ompic ads. &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. On the subway, bro. &gt;&gt; Charles Barkley's doing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ompic ads on the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] subway. Oh, dude. By the way, the New York subway ads were [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Ompic and AI. It was crazy. &gt;&gt; Nick is, by the way, a pathetic pathetic traveler &gt;&gt; because we are on the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] subway. &gt;&gt; Did he get sick on the trip? &gt;&gt; First off, he's never ridden the subway, so he's real nervous to ride. &gt;&gt; Scared. &gt;&gt; Real nervous to ride. This wasn't nervous &gt;&gt; cuz he didn't know what what direction it went into. &gt;&gt; What direction do you go? &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then when love pilots the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ship, we go the wrong way. &gt;&gt; And you and you know how &gt;&gt; Yeah. But he does it with confidence. &gt;&gt; You know, and you know how it works with Nick, right? We land in New York. He's like, I got a bagel spot. It's 7.3 miles away and open from 11:30 to 11:45. &gt;&gt; So So can we can we go? &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; It's crazy also to have been to New York a lot and never have taken the subway. I'm just saying. &gt;&gt; And And so anyway, &gt;&gt; I thought you needed a card. I'm forcing Nick to subway. &gt;&gt; No, use your Apple Pay. You can use your Apple Pay. Now &gt;&gt; you just Apple Pay tap and it's one way. You go as long as you want. So, we're using the subway to go basically everywhere. And we hop on the subway and we're going to some bagel spot or or coffee spot. And uh and I'm I'm doing Hello Chinese, which is &gt;&gt; And I'm the part of the story we're talking about, &gt;&gt; which is the Dolingo equivalent. &gt;&gt; Why aren't you using Dolingo? &gt;&gt; Cuz Dolingo is chopped at Mandarin. Oh, &gt;&gt; it's chopped in general, but it's also just like another step worse at Mandarin. And Hello Chinese is really good at that's all it does. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; They don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] throw in Japanese there, too. &gt;&gt; Sure. Sure. &gt;&gt; So, I'm doing my Hello Chinese. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Uh, [Music] no. No. &gt;&gt; No. Say to the back. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; Let big brother teach you. So anyway, I'm doing that and then I look around and and Nick's the navigator. He's got everything [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mapped on his phone and he's got it. I'm just doing I'm doing sure. &gt;&gt; You're learning. &gt;&gt; I'm learning. And I look and I go, "Oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's the stop." &gt;&gt; Cuz I just saw it on his phone. So I run off the train and Nick's like, "No, are you sure? Let me check." And he pulls it up and the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] doors close. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm outside and he's inside. &gt;&gt; You trapped him on the train. And then he [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] flies away and then everybody on the train laughs at him. &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; They all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] laugh at him cuz he's on the train. He was doing this at the end too. He went &gt;&gt; a little girl a little girl sitting across sitting across the whole ride. He goes, "Mom, what happened? Why are they laughing at him?" &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; And she's like, "His friend, his friend got off." And I went, "He got off at the wrong stop." I just lied. &gt;&gt; He's actually a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; He got off at the wrong stop. I'm like laughing. I'm like, "Hello, idiot. Got him." and I had to walk from the next station. &gt;&gt; I think in that moment there's a clear difference between you and I where if Lewig darts off of a train, no matter what, I will I will follow that. &gt;&gt; Nick didn't trust me. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no. It's not true. So, so what? God damn it. So, first of all, first of all, the bagel thing. I was like, I want to go out of my way to go to like I'm going to I'm not going to ask a local. Last two times I've been here, I've asked a local and I've been pissed off at what I got. I'm like, New York sucks at bagels. New York sucks at bagels. It's time to do my own research. I'm usually pretty good at picking like spots like this. So, I'm going to do my own research. And I picked like a very like popular spot and it was a little further. I'm like, are you down to go out of our way to like maybe see if this is I've been, you know, delusion this whole time. &gt;&gt; That's why I was so far, but that's also not where we were going in the story. Uh, also it sucked butt. &gt;&gt; It was made. It was It wasn't made. &gt;&gt; It was good. It was a good bagel. &gt;&gt; It was He's hard to please. &gt;&gt; He's You can't make him. &gt;&gt; He's He just wants to be defensive about Bagels LA. just clobber. I think it's also a New York Babel place though, but it's here. &gt;&gt; Um, anyway, we're on the thing and Lwig makes a comment. It's two more stops. &gt;&gt; And I'm like, okay. &gt;&gt; In my brain, two more stops. And then it was the next stop. And he goes, oh, this is it. But I'm computing something he said because he's doing the Chinese thing. I'm like, did he forget that he said that? And I'm like, oh, let me just like make sure. And I'm I'm accustomed to like the door speed of like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Japan. Like you've got some time, you know? It's not like in New York, Le walks up to the door almost immediately reopens. The doors do that a lot in subways in New York. I don't know what it is. It goes like so it's doing like this Mr. Beast kind of level trap on him. He walks up. He goes, "Oh." And then it reopens and it goes out and then it closes again. I just think it's going to reopen and then it just we both think it's going to reopen and then it just &gt;&gt; and then it just floats away. &gt;&gt; And then it just floats away. So, yes, it was a lack of trust, but also, you know, the same trip. Lewig goes, "This is our [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] train." I'm like, "Are you sure?" He's like, "Yeah, it's just going the opposite direction." We get on, the only reason we found out, a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fan is on the train and goes, "Lwig, you're Lwig, right?" He's like, "Yeah." And L's like, "Hey, by the way, where's this train go?" And the guy's like, "Oh, you're going the opposite direction." &gt;&gt; You punch him in the stomach. &gt;&gt; And I was just like, "Dude, we wouldn't even have known unless the fans. &gt;&gt; You got to punch in the stomach in front of fans. Can't keep letting him get away. &gt;&gt; There was one fan who definitely did not know my he knew he recognized me but didn't know my name and didn't want to admit it. &gt;&gt; Aiden um oh no &gt;&gt; one guy called me Stans. &gt;&gt; Yeah up and he goes dude [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Lwig Stans I am the biggest unpaid intern fan. &gt;&gt; And you know you know us we're like got me guilty stands. He's like I love unpaid intern me stands. Oh, I gotta meet up with an 11y old. I love unpers I'm like dynamic. &gt;&gt; Why can't I do that? I'm not saying about stands. I'm saying if someone mistakes me for stands, I'm allowed to say I have a date with an 11year-old. Really fast. &gt;&gt; Someone mistakes him for St. 11. &gt;&gt; That is fine. That is fine if you do to that one person. But you can't do it when it happened to Nick pretending you're in his talking on the podcasting. Hundreds of thous jokes. &gt;&gt; He's got a kid on the way. &gt;&gt; He does have a kid. &gt;&gt; You don't have anything about this going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] career, bro. With his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] legacy, bro. He's got a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kid on the way. &gt;&gt; Stan show could go down if I say some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that. &gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] wife. So, put some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] respect on this man, bro. &gt;&gt; Actually, hella disrespectful, dude. &gt;&gt; That is hella disrespectful. And you know what, Stans? I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sorry, bro. &gt;&gt; I got you, bro. I'm the banks of this situation. I do I do think when you have a kid sometimes you have to make less jokes. &gt;&gt; You got to make less jokes, bro. &gt;&gt; Anyway, I would do that. &gt;&gt; A guy walked up a guy walked past the subway and he walked past us and then he screamed. He went, "I'll do an impression." &gt;&gt; And I like I turn around and it's just a guy who recognized Lewig. &gt;&gt; A &gt;&gt; and I was just like, "Dude, what the what's the scream about? Have &gt;&gt; you ever had a screamer before? &gt;&gt; Does it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you? Do you think about it?" &gt;&gt; Huh? Like when we went to Supernova and you had people waiting for 4 hours to talk to you, do you ever think like this is kind of weird? &gt;&gt; Tell them about the guy in Joe's Pizza. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. At Joe's Pizza. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it was Joe's at 4 a.m. &gt;&gt; Oh, dude. Yeah, there was this guy at Joe's Pizza cuz Nick is fat ass was like, &gt;&gt; "Oh my god, you terrorist. &gt;&gt; You're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dude. &gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you for this." Like Tom, dude, we we [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] were walking back or No, we got out of Uber and we're like, "You guys want to get pizza?" L's like, "I'm down for pizza." Yeah, pizza sounds great right now. We go to a pizza place at [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 2 a.m. I get three slices. Him and Shake both get two each. They call they call the fattest guy ever. They call the fattest guy ever. And I'm like, I don't know. I'll put one in the fridge. &gt;&gt; Nick goes Nick goes. &gt;&gt; We get back to the hotel. We get back to the hotel. I'm not put halfway through my second slice and goes, "Can I have your third?" &gt;&gt; You [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] o you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you. O, &gt;&gt; you're a big fat guy. &gt;&gt; That's crazy. Hey, that's not your dent. &gt;&gt; He said he was going to put it in the fridge and I was like, it won't be as good. Might as well enjoy it fresh. And here's the one little crazy thing. &gt;&gt; So, you have to follow the sword. &gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy thing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I had a fourth slice. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he had shake. You going to eat that bit? &gt;&gt; Nasty. &gt;&gt; And these are big [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Neo pie slices. &gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Drizzle did not finish his &gt;&gt; dude. You are a little nasty guy. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I got [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] big, bro. And I won 10k from Jason the on the court, &gt;&gt; dude. Love. I'm not kidding. Lewig maybe watched him play Jason and basketball on his phone on this trip like five times. &gt;&gt; Oh wow. Did they take you watching? &gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] off of it. &gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] off. &gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] come off it though. &gt;&gt; Off it. Where the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Uber? &gt;&gt; I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] beat Jason. I dick. &gt;&gt; Archie joining. Two hours per sitting. Bro, &gt;&gt; uh, we're in the Uber and I was just watching the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] clips back. All right. Fast forwarding to the Jason parts watching his in real time. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to V can't learn from &gt;&gt; I was wet from free. It was abysmal. &gt;&gt; Aiden, I am a more successful basketball player than you'll ever be. I've won $10,000 playing &gt;&gt; real [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] earnings. That's some respect you have to put in my respect for that. &gt;&gt; I'm also the 76th highest earning chess player of all time. &gt;&gt; Is that true? &gt;&gt; Yes, it is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] true. &gt;&gt; Can I say by the way, love? I I haven't watched you play basketball in a while, but I know you guys you have your little thingy play. &gt;&gt; It's crazy you can't dribble with your left hand. &gt;&gt; It's not crazy. It's just hard as so much basketball. &gt;&gt; Can't play on player two. It's grinding. &gt;&gt; No, that shit's really hard. Just grind it. The only time &gt;&gt; you don't try. &gt;&gt; No, I Yes, you're right. I don't practice. I show up to Sunday and I play. That's crazy. &gt;&gt; You don't have the opportunity to practice your left hand in those game. I mean, I guess you could, but you just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] turn it over 100 times. It look like Atriarch. So, it's like I'm I'm &gt;&gt; I'm there. &gt;&gt; You got to wear a t-shirt that says I'm neurode divergent and I'm practicing left-hand handles. &gt;&gt; It basically it's it's like melee, right? It's like I show up and I want to play friendlies. I don't care about grinding my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; No, it's more like you show up and only you play tournament matches. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; No, no, they're friendlies. These are friendlies. &gt;&gt; Friendies are where you are. &gt;&gt; These are friendlies. &gt;&gt; I actually understand a lot. I've just learned a lot about &gt;&gt; I promise you are friendlies. &gt;&gt; Well, wait. What happened to Joe's Pizza? &gt;&gt; Um, well, at Joe's Pizza, we're in the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] line and then this guy's like, "Oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Lwig." And I'm like, "What's up, dude?" And he's talking to me a bit and he's like, "Dude, Marlin's in town." &gt;&gt; Yo, &gt;&gt; no. You said, "Are you from New York?" &gt;&gt; Well, then then that's what he says first. He says, "Marlin Town." I go, "Okay, cool." I go, "You you from here?" He's like, "No, I'm from Florida." I'm like, "Oh, you on vacation?" He's like, "Yeah, I pulled up cuz Marlin's in town." And I'm like, "You came here just because Marlin's in town?" He's like, "No, it's some other shit." But I saw Marlin's in town. &gt;&gt; What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is Are are you just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Is this it? &gt;&gt; I think he was too embarrassed to twice admit that he was he came here cuz of streamers here. &gt;&gt; I think he dead ass just showed up and to run into them. &gt;&gt; That is pretty embarrassed. I would also be embarrassed. But then he ran into Lwig &gt;&gt; and then look what happened. &gt;&gt; Do you think to a guy who's here for Marlin that's a that's a W pull? Absolutely not &gt;&gt; because I think his goal is not to meet Marlin off cam. I think his goal is to meet Marlin on stream. So Lwig offream is way worse. &gt;&gt; That's just Yeah, it's way if you fail your Marlin mission and you succeed at your off Cam Lwig mission. &gt;&gt; Dude, there's a sick clip of the when we played me and Jason basketball for 10K. Someone pulls they definitely stream snipe. They pull up to the park and they go, "Yo, Jason, can I get a pick?" And Jason does the thing where they take a pick on the stream. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then I go, "Do you want a pick?" &gt;&gt; And he starts walking over and then John Jason Cameron goes, "Who who is what's his name by the way?" &gt;&gt; And he goes, "I don't really watch streams like that." &gt;&gt; Oh my god, bro. &gt;&gt; It's so fun. &gt;&gt; So I was playing the the day that they went &gt;&gt; and played. Uh Ludwig asked to take my car and he said he said in &gt;&gt; cuz you got a four-door. &gt;&gt; We'll be cuz I got a four-door car. And he's like, "We'll be back in 25 minutes." And I'm like, "Okay, okay, that's good." Okay, as long as you're back in like As long as you're back in an hour, cuz I want to go play basketball. Like, I'm going to go play tonight. And I'm watching the stream. I'm like, we're we're at the 20 minute mark. They're not even done with the first game. This does not seem to be on pace. And I I Uber there to meet them and and get my stuff out of my car and go play. I'm with a bunch of people playing pickup on the opposite court while they're playing one v one still, which their last game, your first two games were were fine. They like took like 15 20 minutes each, right? Your the last game lasts, I'm not kidding, maybe an hour. They take four breaks during the last game of 1 v one basketball. &gt;&gt; Dude, there's a point where it's 22 and you fast forward like 30 minutes in the VOD and it's 22 and we're sitting down. &gt;&gt; Dude, it's like me versus a sixth grader. It it is exactly &gt;&gt; was the guy who couldn't who couldn't hit from three but could drive and Jason was the guy who only hits from three and &gt;&gt; at that point we were the guys who couldn't do anything &gt;&gt; it wasn't going either way and there's a few people like nobody people have been watching this and they're like they're hyped that it's playing out for 10k but a lot of them like don't really know who either of them are and as more and more people show up some people actually start to recognize them but they only recognize Jason it's like dude that's Jason that's Jason that's Jason And they're all not a single person in the pickup game. &gt;&gt; There's a couple. They knew who Lwig was. &gt;&gt; Dude, is that the Red Bull athlete? I've seen him in videos and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; And then there's And then there's one there was one kid. He was in high school and he had shown up because he lived in the neighborhood and because he recognized a Lwig instead on the stream and then he played pickup with us for like two hours. He had a good time. Was he nice? &gt;&gt; Yeah, he was pretty good, dude. &gt;&gt; I just had a brain blast. Oh my god. Imagine Lwig is was 22 today in 2025 &gt;&gt; and he wanted to be a streamer. What would he be like? &gt;&gt; Cuz he would have to conform to the meta of, &gt;&gt; you know, the biggest streamer, bro. I'd be carving my own path. &gt;&gt; He'd be a Jason viewer, right? He'd be &gt;&gt; he'd be wearing a shooting sleeve on stream. &gt;&gt; Oh my god, bro. He'd be so crazy, dude. The the &gt;&gt; judging by the beat of my own drum. &gt;&gt; Don't you think you'd be IRL streaming more? &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; dude. I don't know, man. because you would have grown up. It's just it's imagining the Lwig we know but 10 years younger and then like trying to be a streamer. It's he he'd have a dorag on &gt;&gt; you and Jason would be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] best friends I think. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; they'd be locked in like 20. &gt;&gt; I don't know if Jason would [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with him. &gt;&gt; No, Jason would not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with him. &gt;&gt; Why would he not? He [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with me now. &gt;&gt; You're not involved. &gt;&gt; Would be one of those [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] now. &gt;&gt; L would be one of those camera guys that follows him around. They stand like this. &gt;&gt; Dude, Lwig. Yeah, Ludwig would be a camera guy. turned streamer. That that would be his path. For &gt;&gt; some reason, I think you think that if I was 22 now, my interest would change. &gt;&gt; Yes, because you would have grown up in a different generation 10 years. &gt;&gt; You'd be different. &gt;&gt; No, I would still love Japan. &gt;&gt; No, you're on China now. &gt;&gt; Well, now I'm on I kept saying love loves Japan. He goes, "No, no, no. I'm on China now." &gt;&gt; I am on China now. &gt;&gt; You're such a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bro. &gt;&gt; But I will say &gt;&gt; Jason [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with you ironically, bro. &gt;&gt; No, he doesn't. &gt;&gt; You are 30. It's crazy to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with you. &gt;&gt; He's W. I don't think it's ironic. &gt;&gt; I'm WK for real. &gt;&gt; I think he looks to him for [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] guidance, bro. &gt;&gt; I think that's We're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] peers in the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] battlegrounds of streams, bro. &gt;&gt; Have you seen the clip? This is at Master Baker when he explains what our Patreon does to Jason and Jason's like, "Dude, no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] way." &gt;&gt; He's like, "Wait a minute. What's a website?" No, that's disingenuous. But my question to you, Jubbin, when's the last time you gave Jason advice? &gt;&gt; When was the last time I gave Jason advice? I don't really give Jason advice like that. I mean, he has to figure his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out. I feel like advice isn't really &gt;&gt; He's never asked for advice. &gt;&gt; Maybe we recorded a show he's doing, I don't think I can leak it, but just like on some of the formatting of it. &gt;&gt; Did you like it? Is that what Did you like it, Woodwig? He He doesn't talk like that. &gt;&gt; Off stream. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Yes. Off stream does not say, "Did you white get wide wig?" &gt;&gt; Yes. He still [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] He's He still talks like the same way he talks. &gt;&gt; Well, guy Well, you got if you want some advice, if you want to join us in the premium, we we got a whole advice show in the Patreon or you can just watch the premium episode which we'll record now up next. &gt;&gt; So, um we'll see you in the Patreon if you want to keep &gt;&gt; wait a better fit today. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Before you vote, Cutie Cinderella bought me this hat. &gt;&gt; Patreon sells gonna be like, "It's Aiden." All right, guys. &gt;&gt; Bye. &gt;&gt; All right. Why does that feel like a shot? &gt;&gt; It's AI. &gt;&gt; When the AI answer gives you what you want. &gt;&gt; Oh my god, you guys are so desperate. &gt;&gt; No one has died and robots were not responsible. &gt;&gt; We did not kill anyone in that race. &gt;&gt; Someone probably died and they're dumb for doing it. And they probably should go live and play Silver League games. &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. &gt;&gt; That would actually be way cool. &gt;&gt; Who could he possibly be talking about? How can he possibly be talking? So he's like so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he's 80.
