He looked me in the eyes yesterday and said, "Your hair's growing back really slow." And then I told him I said I said, "No joke, I think 10 people have told me the exact opposite." Yeah. My mom, my girlfriend said that just like Carlo walks in and he's like, "Your hair's growing back really fast." Carlo can't identify shapes. I don't want to hear [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Just the ending of Alex's friend group. He's like the one in 10 dentists telling you toothpaste doesn't work and I'm just supposed to believe it.

What's wrong with it? Office. What's wrong with it right now? Sorry, it's too early. Who's hurting you, bro? What a new conversation to to kick off episode 200. 200 The Yard podcast. 200 episodes. It feels like just last week we said, "Welcome to episode 100 of The Yard." Yeah. Yeah. I think it was uh it was about a week ago. And um and today you guys, I've prepped a little bit of a activity. Yeah. I thought this was just an outfit. I thought this was all Saints. Yeah. No, that's the You're That's Aiden. That's the other one. Um No. Uh Zip, can you bring up my my little game? I want to get right into it. We're playing Nick Ball. Nick Ball. Yeah, Nick. Um I did that shave my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the other day. I have to Let's go, dude. I have to read the uh uh Nick or any affiliates of the Nick Ball company are not responsible for any injuries, illnesses, or fatalities procured during the participation of Nick Ball injuries. Um, yeah. Why are there many Nick Ball employees? Uh, we'll get to that, actually. Okay. Uh, all right. Well, let's jump right into it. Welcome to Nick Ball. A journey of nostalgia, a trial of wit, and a test of your strength. Contestants will enjoy a trip down memory lane with clips from the other 199 other episodes of this show we have created uh together. From those clips, a series of games, challenges, and trivia will be born, and one winner will be chosen. Are you guys excited? But I do want to know the prize. You want to know the prize? We went to that. It's a later food. No way. It's later. It's the one thing we want to know. Why has this happened? And your remote doesn't work. We tested it. We did all the things. There we go. So, we're in phase We're already in phase one of Nick Ball. It's a very quick moving game. You've entered it without even realizing. There's multiple phases. Well, there's there's two and we're in phase one. First, you guys need to make some selections. Punishment. Currency. Nick Ball has two forms of currency. And I'll I'll give you a little hint. Currency is how you win the game. So, choose wisely. You can either have Nick bucks. Those are really inflated right now. This is going to be like a how nice are we to You can either have Nick bucks which is just raw cash. Yeah. Okay. Nick bucks or you can have Nickcoin. Whoa. Nickcoin is a cryptocurrency. And I cannot I cannot promise that the market will not be volatile during the course of Nick uh what's it called? Nick Buck. Nick pulled a ball light up. So which So all you need to pick a currency that you will play with. Crypto. Crypto. I'm a gambler. You want crypto? Crypto. Yeah. I mean that means I have to go fiat. All right. So we we got we got two cryptos. This actually works out with the personalities. I feel like I like crypto. All right. I don't like crypto. I think crypto is good for America. I think it's good for America. I like crypto. You should make more of it. You bought Trump coin and I'm printing more. one one uh Nick coin also sometimes denoted as dollar sign Nick. Um this is worth a hundred USD. What? Okay. I just want to let you know when you hand me that it's going in my mouth. How much is my That's good. How much is my Nick? Every Nickcoin is scented, dude. And flavored. Second thing you need to choose is your ball. What? Whoa. Everyone who plays Nick ball gets a Nick ball. These are all the same. They're all They're all the same, but it's it's spiritually it's like your Pokemon. It's the color of a dog. Pick the one that calls to you because this is an important thing. To be clear, this is not like Pok√©mon. Yep. Hijacked. Hijacked the one you wanted. Do I get to nothing? You can steal anything in It's mine now. It's mine now. Which one you wanted? Fine. The one the left. The left. Did that stress you out? I almost took it. You threw it too fast. I just had a feeling that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] chain. Um All right. Everyone is everyone happy with their nickball? Would anyone have to trade? I have my nickball. I have cryptocurrency. I don't want to trade. You want to trade? You shake it. Is there something inside yours? There's nothing inside the balls. But there's blood in. There's one inside. And also, you can't chew on it. Aiden, don't chew on yours. I wasn't going to do that. You could chew on it. Everything looks chew on. Why' you make ball like this? Um, the last thing I need you guys to choose in Nick Ball, and this is probably the most important part, is you need to choose your punishments. Now you guys are going to write a punishment for another player. I have to write it. So I can't say it. No, you have to write it. It's secret. But only one of you is going to actually do the punishment written for you. Okay. And you will earn it through Nick Ball, right? You will earn the you will earn the ability to avoid your punishment. And it can be for it can be for anyone. No, I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to assign you. Oh, I'm going to assign you. Well, thought kind of interesting suggestion, Lwig for Nick Ball, if you could also just pick who it's for. I thought Nick Ball was about freedom, but if it's thought it was our choice. Yes. All right, let's do it that way. Let's you pick who it's for. And it could be for anyone. Anyone. Yeah. And one of the people written must do it. Must do it. If they are a player in Nick balling things up. All right. I brought a whistle. So, do we want to go there? Pick a player of Nick Ball and write a punishment for them. And the punishment. Okay. So, it really can't be you. Yeah, it can't be me. You promise? Well, you know what? It can be me. Okay. It can't be me. That's what I want to hear. Yeah. But the but the the uh the the the thing I need need you to understand is that the punishment He just farted. That's crazy. He just farted like that haircut. I want you to know that if if Nick Ball was officially out of phase one that I would have taken away some of your money. Think about that. For that. For that. Yes. It wasn't impressive. It was feminine. There's no way you're gonna you're gonna keep money for that. It smells bad. No, dude. That might give you some money back. So, the thing I need you to understand, the punishment needs to be reasonable to happen in the room during Nickur, like today. Yes, it's going to happen while we're playing Nick. Can I punish myself with an awesome [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Um, can you punish yourself from somebody in the room? Well, I know I'm just pointing around. Oh, I thought you'd have the punishment that you're giving you to give yourself the awesome [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] No, no, I can't do that. I would say a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cannot happen on YouTube. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] can't happen on YouTube. That's not true. In the shed. Uh, then it wouldn't be on camera. Ah, son of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Dickball has so many damn rules. This is like We haven't even gotten to the rules. What? There's going to be rules. All right, so I have to choose a person and they get punished. Um, the punishment part is hard. I feel Have you written yours down? Take your time, fellas. Give me another piece of paper. What? Just use the back. How did you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that up? Just cross it out. I use all the I use all the What? How did you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that up? Yes, you're on a piece of paper. What do we find? Dude, I hate Nick ball. This is Nick Ball. I make the rules. So, we got a limited [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] supply of paper. Nick ball. Nick. Oh, classic Mickball rule. Only one piece of paper. Yeah, Nick Ball company's huge, but they don't got the budget for paper. Give you another paper. Oh, good. You have it. You didn't even have to go get it. You somehow use an entire Why do you think dog penises are that red? Dude, that's such a good question because maybe God made them that way so we wouldn't suck them. Oh, we know they're dangerous. It's like poison. Yeah, it's like a poison flower. Like a poison dart frog. It's like it's so colorful and luminous. Is the first person to turn in his punishment. Where are you guys at? Sorry. Like literally a minute. Uh maxwig, thank you for turning in your work. Thank you for turning in your work. Lewig has earned 100. That's going to deflate. That's going to deflate 100 coin. When that goes with his utility and whatnot, Nick Tua, it's going to go public. It's going to be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. The utility. This is insane. Nick Nick, a student of Nick. Yes. Nick Ball arbiter. Yeah. I have a question. Nick of Nick Ball. Nick of the Nick Ball company. Will this punishment be something that is done multiple times over the course of the game? One time or just one? Okay, one time. Okay, so yeah, make it uh circle it. Big circle. I have a good one. I It took me a while to get there, but I thought of some really crazy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Okay, that sounds like I thought of some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's going to change everyone's life. I think you chose to punish me. You don't have to tell me. What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Why would I do that? Because you Why would I give you an awesome [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dude? Outside, slime goes to give me a gift. Dude, I'm so mad. He He's such a piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm a piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I got you a gift. I said thank you so sincerely. You didn't. You said it almost through teeth. No, I didn't. Thank you. Yeah, I like it a lot. What was the gift? I got him a big canvas laundry bag. So he doesn't have to use a garbage bag. That's such a nice gift. So it's still a bag. It's still a bag. It's still trashy and stupid and idiotic. You don't want that. What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You don't want that. Why doesn't he Why is it trash? Hold on to that. Hold on to that. It's laring. You're wearing a real leather jacket. Okay, everyone has Everyone has completed their punishment. I would like you guys now to say who you wrote your punishment for. Lewig slime. Slime Nick, sorry. I just wanted revenge. It's not true even. Before we get into the rules, also I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] called it by the way, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Before we get into the rules, I would like to reveal something to you. You are all going to perform your own punishments if you lose. They are not for the person you wrote them for. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you, man. This this it makes my So So there's a slide of uh Is this your employees? Yes. So these are my employees. Um love you had asked that question. Actually, you got ahead of that question. Yeah, that was good. What? Appreciate that. That's $100 more dollars in Bitcoin. Hell yeah. That's $100 more in Bitcoin. The boys are so young and and attractive and intelligent. Yeah. Um and we're working on their names and titles. I haven't I haven't allowed them to have those things yet. Like they don't have names yet. Yeah. All right. So, let's get into the rules of Nick Ball. First of all, rule zero. Nick is god, Nick is king. So, that pretty much means I can I can do whatever I want. I can take I can take away money. I can give money. I can make rules. I can change rules. And you can earn money through ways that are not described in the rules themselves. You can you can be nice to me. It's pretty much the same rules of as Nick quiz um in that regard. Uh just want to say that outright. Rule one of Nick Ball is the richest player at the end of the game wins. Rule two of Nick Ball is all trivia answers must begin with well Nick me thinks it. Dude, come on. What is the Sans rule? Do not forget that rule because you will not be given points for the right answers. Well, Nick me thinks it. We We really like the stands it up every time. Yeah. Go. Well, Nick me thinks it and then say the answer. You're adding tone. We don't have the tone. No, just the words. But the tone will, you know, it'll go a long way with me. I'll say it that way. Okay. Uh, rule number three is word play equals money. That means if if at any point, let's say I I be, let's say I say something like uh like write your answer and you and you come up with like a funny piece of word play like the way I do on just now. No, I couldn't think of anything. What if I say uh I thought he had thought you were What if I say what if I if I said like sucker from the back and you and you were like uh well you suck and I'm back. I don't know. That's not good. But if you were to say something that makes me we give points for I have to go off of what you guys say. I can't do it all internally. Money I play with her word. See that would not earn money. That would be Wait, hold up. That was better than yours. I would go. Do you lose money if you do if we do what you did? Um, if it's really bad, you will lose money. If it's just neutral and I'm like, eh, then you don't know, you know, push. And then if it's good, you will earn money at any point in the game. So, I don't give [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] anything. You get nothing for that. That was terrible. Um, all right. Rule number four of Nickfall. You can purchase the right. You can spend money to make a new rule. How much How much does it cost? Uh, determined by what you want. Money. Seems it's a market and I decide. So, we have to offer the idea. You offer an idea and I will barter with you and then we will arrive to a price we agree on and then you can change the rule. And you have two nitcoin. I do. I do. Oh, already. He's two nit. He has the entire economy of nitcoin. I am the king because there are no other holders. Is it fractional? Uh what does that mean? Can are you able to? No. No, it's not fractional. I'll sell you my coin. How much? Um you want real money? Real like actual money in the world? Yeah, real hard cash. What do you want? What do you want? $101. Allow that. Yeah. If you want to buy a coin with real money, I'll allow that. You're Oh my god. Counter two. $102. Okay. No. Okay. But please, please. Uh, it must go up by increments of five. I'm holding off. I'm turned off by the 102 comment. Look what you did. You made it weird. The last rule of nickball is simple. Um, there's actually a third uh hidden rule here that I forgot to say, but I'll say it. So, the first hidden rule is you cannot set your ball down. So, make sure you have your ball in your hand. That won't count. That's fine. Have your ball in your hand and for the rest of the game, you must hold on to it. I want to make sure you're using effort to hold it. Hand on the car. You got so much power. You got so much nasty little power for nasty. No, don't let him touch it. Hey, don't ever touch my ball. All right. With the ball, there will be two types of ways you can use it. Dunking and shooting. Shooting you can do one time at any point in the game, and that's the basket. Oh, you have to stay in your chair and if you make it, you instantly double your money wherever you are and you get you whatever you're holding, you double. If you miss it, you lose everything you're holding. So, it's up to you if you would like to do it. Wow. You do not need to use your shot. You can do it infinite times. But dunking but dunking you just don't. Actually, infinite times. I love Nick ball. No, one time. You get one time. What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Such a horrible [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] because then he'll spam it. Why does he walk? The second the second rule is dunking. So the way the dunking is going to work is you are going to see a screen like this. This is not a real dunk screen. So do not do not attempt to dunk. But you will see a screen like this and you have to dunk in that hoop. But it's a race and I have forgotten a rule of nickball. I'm going to change things right now. You don't have to hold on to your balls. Actually give me your balls. Everyone give me your ball. Dude, wait. Are we breaking the rule if I can do my ball? You you've you know you you know it's a bad game when you have to explain the rules for 20 minutes. I'm going to hurt myself. You know Nick made this game. I'm going to hurt myself playing Nick Ball and I'm going to sue Nick Company. I'm going to get I'm going to get her fired. We're going to get full name fired from title. The actual rule is when this screen pops up, you must race to your ball and you must be the first to dunk it. I'm holding coffee. You piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] If you dunk your ball, you are immune from your punishment. Well, I don't even know which one of them is mine. Whichever one. Okay, that part wasn't really real. The ritual of picking the ball is irrelevant. Yeah. Okay. So, you must race to your ball. Fight Bulbasaurus. You must dunk the ball and there is only going to be two dunk screens. So, at the end of the game, one of you will have not dunk. This is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] horseshit. And you will be the person who is punished. Nick, do you see what's in front of me? But you're the most athletic. This is the This is all thought of. I I have to get through him. He's the least athletic. If I If I harm Nick, then I'm out. If you If you harm Nick in in the in a feat of athleticism, you might be rewarded. Swing on him. swing on him while running over there. I might, but then he might be he might wake up from a coma in a week and be like, "You lost Nick Ball." Well, you'd have a week of not knowing. Are you guys ready for round one of Nick Ball? Is this phase two? This is phase two. Okay. Round two. Is phase one the rules? Phase phase one is the rules. And well, you also met the staff. If you had money, I'd take it. You also met the staff. Some of us made money in round one. We even changed the rules in in phase one. Really? In phase one, we decide what Nick Ball is. You know, we do our homework in class when it's due. Feels like it has a lot before the teacher picks. Let's start with round one. When my mic hits his head, can you make a bone like bonk [Music] noise real? Wait, wait, wait. Real another one. When I do this, can it be like we're driving the the And then can we all zoom out of frame and then put a really big anime character in the sky, Archie. And I'm not paying you more. And I'm not paying anymore. We're just adding. That was from February 2023. That's right. And for your first game, I want you guys to torture Archie. Ah, we're going to go one at a time, and you have to make the hardest 5second span of the episode for Archie to work with. But there is an added caveat. The episode must still be watchable. So you can't just make a big He if he blurs the whole screen to solve whatever you've done for him, you've ruined the episode cuz it is not watchable. So you must create a 5-second span that is difficult for Archie to work with in the edit that still creates a good episode of the podcast. Okay, I have it. Would you like to go first? Yes, I would. Okay, for 5 seconds, I would like if Archie paused the video and sang beautifully himself. I want Archie himself to sing beautifully. What was the song you asked? Okay, Archie has to sing for 5 seconds. I would like for Archie to sing for 5 seconds. I would like it to be What about the Queen's anthem? I would like it to be Oh, man. He's British now. She's dead. That vile. I would like I would like it to be queen. You want him to sing queen? Some Yeah. Somebody to love. What is there anybody to love? Somebody love. Is there any visual that you want on the screen? Uh Archie. You want I want Archie green screened in right here singing Somebody to Love. I get 5 seconds. This is my five. You get five. Roll the tape. Can anybody You didn't let me finish. Wow. We haven't even heard it and we just I can't even. I'm okay with Brexit now. Who would like to go next? I would like to go next. All right, Archie. For the next 5 seconds, we are all going to react to Aiden becoming fat, bald, and inflated and big and big and juicy and weird. He's going to look so photorealistic that it can't be discerned that this is actually fake. No using AI. No, hold up. You can't add that last part. Oh, I mean it. That's the only way it's feasible. No, Archie has to find a way. He said no using AI. All right. And we're reacting to Aiden getting big. 3 2 1 Oh my god. Oh, he stinks. like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You smell bad. You look terrible. Wow. Good answer. Don't touch it. Good answer. All right. I'm going to leave uh Tubby over here. What do you want to do? All right, Archie. Archie, I'm going to need you to use multiple angles of the camera to shoot me running across the set and doing a 360 while I shoot the basketball. And your job is to edit this in the fashion of a Call of Duty montage using multiple angles and then make the ball go in no matter what. What's the song? As you guys attempt to sing the chorus from Clarity by Z. Okay. Yeah. Uh I don't know if I know 5 seconds of it. I know it. I know it. Just follow my lead. Yeah. Okay. Uh and go. If our love is love you my [Music] Did you shoot it? I did. I did. I tried to do this. I mean, it doesn't matter. You know, he as far as the people will see, he shot it. Wow. Did you hurt your ankle? Dude, if you don't if you can't play basketball cuz you got hurt playing Nick ball, that's embarrassing. It's so embarrassing. The injury rate Nick ball is really high. It's like it's really controversial to put your kids in. Okay. So, okay. Does that count as a shot? And that is Aiden's one shot. He gets You get one shot for double. It was double or nothing. You have nothing. And does it actually count cuz he has nothing healed? He loses all his money, which he doesn't have any. But now he can no longer go for the double. Dare I say they're not holding their ball right now? No, it's supposed to be there. He missed the nick rule. Dude, the nicadendum. You've been here for all phase one. You wake up. You were attentive during Wake up. We're in phase two. My ankles hurt. Okay. Well, guys, guys, I still have to judge. So, I really enjoy those. Those are all really I thought Aiden was the only person who took the assignment as I intended, which was it would happen here. I see. Um, yeah, that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] But I I I like you forcing Archie to do something. We do pay him a lot, but just it's such delayed gratification. I I don't I don't know if he's even going to do it. I don't know what it's going to be like. So, I can't award you the win. I figured he wouldn't. Slime, I think, had my favorite idea cuz I just imagined Aiden getting fat and big and big and juicy and fat and big and I Whatever Archie does, I know I'm going to love it. It's going to be so pepperoni nipples. It's going to be crazy. So, slime, here's 100 nickel one. Yes. Uh, he said this. I can see it through your lips. It's It's shining through your lips. Don't eat the nick coin. Open your mouth when it tastes good. Ah, it's a damn part of your mouth. I'm trying to join it. It looks pretty cool. It looks kind of stupid. It looks pretty cool, dude. The light behind your teeth. Um, all right. We're in round two of Nickcoin, guys. Um, Rear Fra's going to change the game with that. Let's watch a clip from August 2021. One of them I came on. Oh. Oh, lifeer level. Yeah. Wait, wait. Like, and you have to eat one. You have to eat one donut. But you have to pick. And if you pick the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] one, you have to eat it all. But what's what do I win? If you don't pick the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] one, you win 10k. Wow. This is good odds. What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I would Yeah, I would eat the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] donut for 10k. I don't care. I know you're clean. I would I would also do that. Don't shake on eating my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] weird. Welcome aboard. Welcome aboard. 10k is 10k, baby. I might have to lower the mug. I This is I don't know why this You wouldn't do this. No. No shot. What would you do it for? Free. Welcome to the come donut. Oh. Oh, dude. Dude, as soon as I walked in today, I You thought about this? No. I saw these on the counter and I thought, "This is going to have to do with the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] donut." Really? Whoa. And this sits in your mind. So, here's how the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] donut works. There are three delicious donuts and they are filled, but only one of them is a come donut. Has your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in it? You guys have the option to eat a donut. If you eat the donut, you will instantly win money. This is such worse odds than the video. It's 33%. Repeating, of course. But you do not have to pick one, and you don't have to eat one. Well, same with the video. It's not like I was forcing you to eat my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] This is a I feel like this is and how much money do you win? You're going to win a lot of money. Okay. Okay. This is an important question. Let's just go back the in the video. I offered 10k for a one in 12 of the income. This is a one in three and you win some Nick bucks. Yeah. Which could be worth more than 12 of any currency. But it's also kind of about it's also testing our gangster cuz like we said we would become not testing your gangster. Well, we said we would. That's I think it's real testing your word. I don't think that's true. You don't think? You think on the south side they're not eating a little? I just watched American Gangster. It didn't come up. I'm a 86 [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] gangster [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] They eat one. They eat one. No, that that's that's a that's a nickin. That's a nitcoin for that currently. There's an important question here. Who would like a a donut? Who came? Whose [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is it? That's information you get after you eat. I don't think so. I don't think so. We're allowed to know the nutrition of what we put in our bodies. Is it clean? Because it's like Zipper. Maybe he's been eating pineapple for 4 weeks straight. I would do that. Okay, this is what I'll say. The [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] donut is not actually [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but it isn't cream filling from the donut. It's something else. I wish it was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Yeah. Like, can we go? Would you like me to go ask the chef to shake? Actually, you like me to bring it back to the kitchen? Uh, all right. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] show her here. All right, which one do you want? Well, can I see you? No, cuz you did a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] butch job putting them all together. Well, Rich did it, so why don't you tell it to Rich? Oh, wait. One of them has finger marks on it. I'm I'm not trying to bet a game, but one of them has clearly has finger marks on it. Do you want to go first? I I I think I literally touched it as I opened it. Are you guys all want to take one?

And that one has uh seemingly not enough mustard in it, which is I was so close to eating this. They were sitting over there. Oh, you going to grab one? Yeah, I was just going to eat it. That's what I when I walked in, I saw the donuts and I was like, man. And then I saw that there was only three and that they were cream donuts and I was like, this has to do with the coming donut.

He goes, "Oh, what is the context of that?" Uh, I had uh I had our our production assistant, Aaron, look at about 2 hours worth of fart videos for that. And that's the one I took out. That is crazy. You have to find one you haven't seen. I knew it would make everyone laugh. Is that what he's doing on the laptop the whole day? Yes, that was almost exclusively what he was doing. That's a busy day at work. He sent me a message that said I had I have six farts in there already and I screenshotted it. All right, round four. It's a dunk round, y'all. Oh, Lwig is in the lead.

It's the punishment is how you win. It's not just about not losing. This was in phase one. It's all this was in FA. Remember when he remember when he went to hand me his paper after Lwig tried to hand me his paper? I said, "Oh, no. You hold on to it." I mean, it really is George Castanza's mom. A lot of this, can you pull it up? George Cass's mom really fast. Let me do it. His hair, it just looks like George Castanza's mom. My mother today. I look like an Italian mother.

Slime is your captain and you are Captain Gay. Oh yeah. Commander of the USS Love J. Dude, that's so you are giving a motivational speech to your crew during a stormy expedition. All the while the crew, you two uh are organizing a revolt to overthrow the captain, which you are clear has nothing to do with the captain's name or its implications of his sexual preferences. Role play the overthrowing of Captain Gay. You either all get points or none of you do. Is is is is everyone on the USS uh love jizz gay? Uh I don't know. I wouldn't want to ask what it's a workplace. Their sexual preferences are who they ask. I'm Captain Gay. Yes, but that's my military. They know you're captain gay. We don't even name. We don't even know that you're I want to say this is during don't don't ask don't tell era of the military, right? Okay. So presumably maybe I do. And you did name the ship the USS Love Jiz. We'll call it. So that was me. That was you. This is my ship. I'm the captain and they are your crew and you don't realize that they are plotting to overthrow you. You're giving a motivational siege cuz you're in a you're in a rocky storm. Right. Right. Right. And you're trying to make you kind of persevere, but they they have been planning this revolt for a while. Okay.

I just feel like the structure of this boat doesn't feel as solid as the other boats. Are you someow trying to say that you're you don't enjoy the naming? Some of the other people on this boat might be more well equipped to captain the boat. Captain, Mr. Captain Gay. Captain Jiz was my grandfather and he fought in the Civil War. Captain Gay, he he fought on the Confederate Confederate side, sir. It was complicated. And and and second off, we just don't like the name Love Jiz. You don't? it. Well, my girl at home left me because I told her I worked on the Love J with Captain Gay and I want to hold down a relationship. It's not really about the name for me. I feel like it's more just your your my discomfort with your background. For me, it's just the name. I am homophobic. Well, let's meet in the middle, guys. We got to get to the bridge. We got to start doing work to to combat this storm. What do you say we all bring it in like a group? a group kiss. See, see, I told you. All I wanted was a little love and affection from you, my captain. I mean, it's if you guys can keep it quiet, I'll give you whatever you want. I I won't keep quiet unless you change the name or make him captain. What do you throw as a name change? I would name it to Hate Jizz on me. Hate Jiz on me, sir. An iceberg. Oh god. Okay, really quick. Let's meet in the middle. Neutral on Jizz. It's the USS neutral on Jiz. Jiz exists. Do we still get to kiss young private? What do they call him in the in the Navy? Skipper.

For the lot of you. Wow. We This is an actual argument that I just had right now cuz Aiden were This is a MeUndies ad. MeUndies is great. And he was saying, "I have so many of these. It's awesome. I don't have any." I also don't have any I have very old ones and they're over half of my underwear now because that's insane, dude. That's insane because my my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I've run out I lose my underwear a lot. Don't ask why. But you actually you need to start breaking me off some of this because we get them for free cuz we're sponsored and it's annoying that you have them all. You're wearing it right now. Yeah, I was running out of underwear. Honestly, before we got sponsored by Meundies, I just hadn't gone to buy new pairs of underwear. Similar to slime, I think I slowly would lose them over time. Well, tell me how they are. And then they're wonderful, breathable, stretchy, a little fashionable. They're every guy's butt. So, I guess that includes you, a snake. Yeah, snake butts, but also honest butts like myself. Yeah, they also if you're somehow not happy with them, you can uh your first pair it's on me undies, which is kind of nice. But I the the you can tell it's a good product because I'm pissed that I'm not that you're taking cuz we're literally fighting over it. I I want to keep them for myself because of how much I've enjoyed them and how much I actually like this like this product and you will never get any of the ones we're sent because I will keep stockpiling. I'm going to kick your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] head off. If you ever wondered why the rest of the clothes on your body aren't as comfortable as underwear, they've got you covered. They have joggers. They have all sorts of hoodies, onesies, and more. If you ever wanted to wear an adult onesie. Yeah, if we got those in the mail, you'd probably take that, too. Take that, too. Absolutely. You'd probably have uh sex in it. Okay. None of that is happening with any of the males on this podcast. I'll say that much. Anyway, slide into gamechanging comfort with MeUndies.

Okay, so you're in second place, you're in first place, and you are in last place. Why' I say you for audio listeners? Uh, slime first, Aiden second, Lewig third. All right, round eight. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up the mic. You guys ready? I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. Yes. It's going to be a dunk. Uh-oh. It's not a dunk. Misunderstood as anything besides ironic banter, the public was misled into believing Nick is actually a misogynist. Nick just fell quadruple its value. Wow. So, uh, I have to give you three. Yeah. Uh, I I have eight. So, give six. I have to give you six. That's hand. Hand it over. You picked the volatile route. Thank you. It's time for me to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nut up or shut up. What's that? It's not a good idea right now cuz it's going to go up again. Shoot it later. No, Krypto. I need to double it now. He wants his shot. I need to double it now. Take your shot. I I I'm acting on emotion. All right. The thing is you got to act Krypto is all about acting on emotion very quickly. 4 hour video shooting playing basketball. You didn't hit one of these. Like what are you thinking is going to happen here? Because I'm due once again. Nobody Have you considered that nobody's defending him right now? You're due when he shoots in the clear. If he hits a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm going to lose it. Quiet. Everyone on the court. That's disgusting. It was him. That was Lwig. Wet. Oh, off the tree. He's wet. Wet. You did off the tree. Now give me that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] How much you got? I got two. I need two more. Okay, I'm giving you four more. Wet. Wow. Because he called wet, dude. Called wet. Use the environment. No, that was kind of badass. It was like there's like an okay go video. That was got to be the coolest thing you ever done. Wow. And they didn't ask you to go on the dude peep cruise. Don't ask me now. After after co Kobe sees that. This is going to be a dunk. I know Nick. This is a dunk right here. Round nine. Like Arizona back when we were Sunundevils. Get real hot. Oh, then you'd be like you'd be like, "Yeah, Marsha right at the quad. The quad." It's called the MU. Yeah. Yeah, we hang out in the quad and there was there's no quad, man. There's a quad. Oh, so there's no Breland either. Do you remember Rush Week? The dumb part The dumb part about all this is that he has literally met three of the people I went to college with when he went to New York and didn't name them. He named Brelin and Marsha. Yeah, we remember those guys. I think I Yeah, he met them. They were all there together though. There's no reason to like not name them. I know it was more the It was like the deep cuts. These are people you wouldn't remember. Okay. You know what I'm saying? It was kind of like a club thing. You didn't get really involved in like I got involved a lot of the club. You were in the Smash Improv corners. You might not have known Brelin. Was crazy. He was. Yes, he was. You think he was. You remember we went to that morning bar and you always pull out really good uh like actual college party [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cuz you you did it. I hope you guys remembered the last part of that clip where he said you went to the morning bar and he said he was crazy. He started doing finish that sentence where it finishes you. He started doing what? And this was the birth of breath. Jello shots. Wait, wait, wait. Before you answer, write it down. Okay. Well, I answered. It's kind of I'm going to answer. The answer is not jello shots. Yay. I mean, what about my answer? Brereslin was crazy. I don't hear your answer. Okay. Nick me thinks the answer is he started doing everyone ready? Yeah. Y 3 2 1 flip lines whippits and you said LSD/ drug. Yeah. Okay. That's two answers. So drugs. None of these are the right answer. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Dude, Brandon was crazy. The correct answer is he started doing two shots at once. It's hard to remember. It's just Brereslin also did so much. Yeah. like which time at the morning bar could and right after the two shots at once. Oh no. No. What do you mean? I mean I can't do that. I thought of you. That actually that actually his answer there that makes me I I think I'd rather be buy your way out of this one. Do you have to drive anywhere today? Oh, would you have to do two shots at once? I'll take one. Or you can buy your way out. How much does it cost? Barter with me. Uh, I have one. I'll take your one. And that would get me out of a shot. Yeah. So, if I did two shots, I would get 10. Yes. For two shots at once. You can't do them like that. You have to do them out like Brelin. Well, boys, Brelin died a long time ago. And it's time I remembered him. You're taking a shot. It's two shots. You're doing two just like Brelin would. You're doing two for a rack. Wow. And then slime. Would you like He's doing the artist face. I'm going to level with you guys. What is he doing? I under no circumstance want to do the punishment that I wrote down. What about this? Wow. Wow. Awesome. That looks like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Seoia, dude. Dude, you are an artist. Dude, Teddy Roosevelt protect that back for a moment. Um, one of those in a while. I I'll just pay to not drink it. God mode May. I can't drink two shots at once. Oh, I didn't know about God mode. May Oh, wait. thing. Um, yours is soy sauce. Oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that has alcohol in it. You're trying to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] break my Look at the package. Oh, I'm remembering what it was like to be a Sunundevil. Sunundevil horns up. It does not say alcohol. It does say wheat. Same. It doesn't have alcohol. You lied. Give it. Uh, you want to do out of the packet or out of the shot glass? I'm going to do a shot glass. What? It's ceremonially, but I was trying to get off on a technicality. Would you like to do it like Brezlin? Of course I'd like to do it like Brelin. Sounds right. Sounds right. So basically I'm I'm drinking. It lowkey smells. Do you like that soy sauce? Do you like that I'm drinking? You just check. Yeah, it lowkey. This lowkey had soy sauce yesterday. I was with you, bro. Low key. Low key. You should smell it and do it. I won't. Is God mode me? Here's one. And here's two. Would you guys like to say a little bit of a word to Brelin while we What's up, Brereslin? I know you're down there in hell with Osama bin Laden right now cuz you had a hand in all of that. He did have a hand in stuff that went down. But I want to say personally, you touched a lot of lives and you I mean, not including the lives at New York City that day, 2,997. Yeah. Uh but the lives touched a lot of people in college that I think in hindsight I feel like he crossed a few lines and I don't, you know, I don't know how I feel about that. And that's kind of like what you have to do is reconcile with the people that you knew when you were younger and sort of get perspective on the things that they made. Well, that boy could party. Party so hard. But he could party. And that's what we're remembering right now. To Brelin. Depress. It's like one day of the year you can remember that he partied. And the other 364, you more than him. I I don't even put soy sauce on my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bro. I hate it. Hey, good job. Good job, guys. All right. If I get the hiccups, I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] decking you. Oh, dude. If he gets the hiccups. No, I'm just kidding. Here you go. Here's your reward. Yay. More money. Here's your reward. Ah, thank you. Thank you. It's good thing that I was wet from three. You were wet from three and now I think you could be in the lead. And the follow-up to this quote, which I also thought was funny, was Aiden goes, "And he would never just do one." Um, all right. Ready? Oh. [Laughter] Oh no. And he [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] slams him. Slime just stood in front of him and said, "What are you going to do?" And ran around him cuz that's what he was always going to do. Slime tried to shake him down like they were in the street. Dude, I I was I was like, "I can't punch him in the face." Oh. Oh god. I I got soy sauce in me. I'm an athlete. Oh, dude. It's time to serve your punishment. What did you write down for someone else? Should we read ours that we don't have to do? Yeah, please. Everyone, let's go. Start with Aiden. What did you guys write? Yeah. What were you so scared of? I wrote down I wrote down that slime had to suck two toes of one member on the set of the show. Oh my. You freaky frog. So, you would have to done that. You're a little freaky frog. Uh, I wrote that Nick has to give me his shoes. So, Oh, that would have sucked so I would have had to given you my shoes presumably. That would have been lit. Cuz I think it's the flip. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Well, why would it suck so bad? Do you like your shoes a lot? Yeah, these were gifted to me. Oh, no. Oh, it's fine. It's not that bad. I I know when they're really bad. Oh, okay. Lwick calls Cutie and says he got arrested and she has to bail him out. So you have to call cutie. Yeah. Just not in a million years would she buy that. I think uh if you did it maybe that's the funny part. I have to call him and I have to call her and say slime was arrested. I feel like I call her. You call her. I feel like if you call and you say are you with Lewig and she says no. She's like I couldn't get him to answer. You start with that. Then you say I'm arrested. Yeah. She might buy that. Oh. And he never picks up. He never picks up. All right. I hope she doesn't pick up, bro. I think she will, man. Oh well. Oh well. Wow. All right. If she calls back during the course of the episode, you must pick up. If she doesn't, you don't have to do it later. Very lucky. Round 10 of Nick Ball. Okay. This is a freestyle round. This is your chance to shine in any way you deem fit. If you would like to try to earn some money, impress me, uh, if you would like to, really anything you want, freestyle. And who would like to go first? Let me tell you something. Oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Hello. Hello. Hello. Hey. Um, this is uh, this sucks. I have to call you about. I tried calling Lwig. He obviously didn't pick up. I am I got arrested. What? Okay. Yeah. So, I'm in um [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what is it? Glendale. Okay. I'm in the Glendale like holding place or whatever. Okay.

But do you know how much? Hey, how much? 7,000. That's like 7,000. Oh, okay. That's not bad. Okay. I really I really What's the address? Uh, it's the It's just the Glendale like PD or whatever. I I I don't know. I can send it to you. They're letting me use my phone, which is cool. But this one's Burbank. That's dope. Okay. All right. I I really appreciate it. Yeah, of course. Okay. All right. Bye. You had to call her. You had to call her. She had to call Wow, dude. What a real She's real as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for this. Oh my god. Oh god, this is bad. You got to call her. She's supposed to call in 10 minutes. This is so bad. This is so bad. I don't like this bit anymore. Okay. Hey, listen. We're on the show. I had to do that as a punishment. It was supposed to be Lewig who did that and it got reverse carded on me. I'm not in jail. Uh we we just did it for the bit. please don't leave uh the house or do any of that. Do whatever you were going to do to stay. And I got to say that was the most gangster [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to ever respond to that. That was crazy cuz I literally I grabbed my purse with my ID and my debit card and I already called Pok√©mon and canceled girl dinner. No, that was that you No, you just call her back. Just call her. Just call her back. Call her and we'll send her flowers and we'll send her flowers. Yeah. Like but that was insane. Uh, I I I'm beside myself with loyalty. That was I'm surprised he only said 7K. I was like, wait, that's a deal. You didn't even ask what I did. No, I'd figure it out later. That was the hardest [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] That was real as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Oh my god. I'm calling Dude, if I get arrested, I'm calling Cutie. All right. Well, okay. Thank you. I thought you were going to I You know what? Honest to God, I thought you were going to tell me that Let me got in a motorcycle accident. Yeah, I wanted to You know what? As soon as I started that, I was like, Ludwig didn't pick up. I wanted to make sure that was out of your mind. So, I made it clear that Wow. He he wasn't hurt. Pokey Poky's going to think I'm crazy. I called Pokey. I was like, "Hey, I can't explain anything, but I have to cancel Girl. I know you're on your way, but like I have to go get Call now. Call her now. Okay, come on." All right. Oh my god. Oh my god. That's the realest [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ever. Wow. She's a real one. Excellent work. She's cool, man. Um, that was sick. We are still in the freestyle round. Would anyone like to perform or do anything? Earn some money. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I want to talk about uh I've seen you with your shirt off a lot. Okay. Um, think about it a lot. Okay. You want to see me now? No. I think you have the bet out of the four of us. I think you have the most round nipples. Oh, I think I do have pretty round nipples. Cheerios, if you will. Get a load of that. Okay. I Aiden writes, "I love you." He also I think he was about to write a what is the V? Is it going to be a Y? Oh, it's it's a little typo. Just had to you wrote it wrong. Mush it down. Mush it here. I'll get rid of the tip. Does that make you feel more comfortable? Look how round. Show what he said. I'm very uninterested by you right now. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] They're so good. Yeah. I just want to let you know that I notice things about that and I think that's good. How do I look like I've lost weight? Ah, a little bit. What's yours? H what's my freestyle round? Yeah. Uh mine is actually a moment of silence. Okay. Everyone, please shut the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. That's good. What was that for? Huh? What was it for? 911. Yeah. Wow. I almost forgot. I did, to be honest, forget. And I just talked about it like 10 years ago. Reward somebody who's forgotten when we were supposed to never forget. So now, Nick, you get to reward the points. It's so ugly to try to sabotage another player like that. It's so ugly. It ugly doesn't look good on. Can we just have conversations? Actually, I have another freestyle round request. What is that? I would like to for the freestyle round uh do a basketball shot for uh 10 points from there deal. And if I miss, I lose everything I have from outside the grass. How much do you have? I have a few. But I won't say exactly how many. If you miss, I'll let you keep him. Okay. In the freestyle round. Wow. You really bartered against him. So, wait. He gets three shots. Really? No deal. Wait. We turned this into three shots. Uh, Judge Mick Ball. Oh. Uhoh. One more. Wow. Three shots and you couldn't even make it. I was wet. Yeah, you were wet. That shoe was uneventful freestyle round. Slime takes it. Great work. See, you just got to compliment his physical features. Round 11. I have any [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] round 11. She said the funniest one was Nick. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] go. Nick's great with mom. I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] five for five with mom. I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out here. I'm five for five with Nick's mom. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yeah, he's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] her, bro. Aiding gets $100 for that giving or something. I see the city a bit. Yeah. Yeah. She said uh she said uh we liked Nick slime appears intelligent but not funny. That's crazy she said that. She's French bro. Appears intelligent by the way. But but then but then she said more real and keeps the agenda up. And then she said Aiden spelled your name wrong is more reserved but so natural in front of the camera. A natural. You have to understand she's European. She has to insult you in the end. She's an awful awful person. I missed bro. We got to have a V again. Word that I have your mom's number. I'm text her right now. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you. Don't text her now. Don't remember that fun day. That was a crazy day. That was a good episode. We learned that we learned to not do that cuz Lwig will never forget. Stand up mdity. Think of your best joke. Lewig will send them unnamed all three of them to his mother and she will pick which one she likes the most. Stand up. thinks is the funniest and whoever wins based on her taste is the winner of the round. Okay. Um that's so hard over text. Well, you just say mom. I have three jokes. Which one do you think is the funniest? Do I read them? Should I call her and read them? Call her and read them. I think we get immediate uh gratification. I think she should be done teaching. Oh, it's Saturday. Never mind. My bad. For some reason, I thought it was Friday. Your ass was in detention, huh? Oh, this is such a marathon. I've had to do so much damn work. Mhm. Um, yesterday making the damn thing. Wait, I'm just gonna look up one. Hold on. Whoa. You can do that. Oh, wait. Do I tell Do I tell the joke now about Yeah. Do you have your joke? What's your joke? Yeah. Lwig says he'll visit home soon. Oh, I'm going to go to my mom and say I have three jokes and that's going to be one. You want me to say that one? I'm going I'm going in two damn weeks. It's tough cuz it's like a coin flip on how sad it makes her cuz she hasn't seen you in so long. I've seen her. Does Aiden really want to run run the gamut of making your mom sad again? I've seen her. Why did the German uh bring a ladder to the bar? Why? Cuz he heard drinks were on the house. And I know this would appeal to her sensibilities of hating Germans. Uhhuh. Cuz she's European or something. Stupid German would think the beers are really up there. Okay. Do you have yours? Uh, my joke is just imagine imagine Peter is Santa at a mall and the child is slime sitting on his lap. Just imagine it. Not really a joke. I think it's fine though. It's an imagery. Okay, I can do that. It's something you would say in a conversation. Yeah. Okay. I have three jokes that I'm going to tell you and I just want you to pick the funniest one. Okay. Okay. The first one is just a visual. Okay. So, imagine you we're at the we're at the we're at Fezant Lane Mall and Peter is Santa and Slime is the child sitting on Santa's lap. Oh, okay. That's just the first one. The second one. The second one. The second one is what do you call a fish with no eyes? A Do I have to guess? Do I have to guess the answer? No, it's a it's a because there's no I Right. Explain it. Explain it to her. All right. Okay. And then and then the last the last one is um uh why did the German bring a ladder to the bar? A lighter. Oh, no. No. Sorry. Why did the German bring a ladder to the bar? A ladder. Okay. Because they heard the drinks were on the house. Okay. So, considering all three, which one is the funniest? Uh, definitely not the number two. [Laughter] Uh, I'm going to say number one is kind of original. All right. Original and, you know, probably perfect at the same time. Yeah, probably a little bit. Probably a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. But it's original. It is original. Yeah, you're right. The other two were stolen. All right, have a good day. Wow, Aiden wins with the originality. I knew my way to her heart. Gosh, that's a 100 Nick bucks for you. She's awesome. Look, I did I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] not put it on the line delivering his money for that. Yeah, I was going to say you gave all three your best in that. You sold it. I really tried hard. Wait, we get the same amount of points. That's That's volatile and you can't buy food with it. This is very volatile. That could crash again. Yeah, you can't you can buy food with your money. All right, round 12. Nick food. This is an easy one. What month in year did the first episode of the Yard release on YouTube? Use your whiteboards. What month and year did the first episode of The Yard podcast release on YouTube? I got it, baby girl. All right. 3 2 1 turn. June 2021, July 2021. Uh, slime. If you look really closely at the enormous awesome rod, it says June 2021. Somewhere along the shaft where we all still kind of have some hairs. Um, let's reveal the answer. July 2021. Aiden takes it. That's crazy. I thought it was June as well. It's cuz I set the deadline for June, but then [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Nick obviously never What's the surprise there? What's the surprise there? That one for the second game. Guess what? D and D is going to come out. That's the right answer. 2047. Deadline. What is this? The lovely merch booth. And I'm taking some money. And I'm taking some money for myself. All right. And you know, I like Bitcoin. Uh-oh. There's no more dunks, guys. Don't laugh. [Laughter] Oh man, I I almost Why is it so long, dude? That's so unfair. It is long. All right, you two didn't laugh. Great one. God. Wow. I thought that one was going to get everyone. I failed my disgust for those beans. I held out for so long. buckle. You were doing so good. Really nice try. Okay, I just l checked Rocket Money right now and this is no joke. I am still paying $20 a month for an Xbox Live account for Nick's PSL setup. I never use this login. I never glitch $20 a month. So, you can log into one of the Xboxes downstairs. No, it's it must be a mistake. Which that only happens twice a month. There's a guy at Microsoft whose job is to manage this revenue. That's a crazy thing to think about. So, you're saying you downloaded an app that told you you were spending money on something I need? No, it download it told me something that I'm spending money on something that isn't even for me. Okay. Well, what is this app? So, I can cancel it. Rocket money. I could use it to cancel the subscription straight in the app. By the way, you talking about the personal finance app that cancels your unwanted subscriptions, monitors your spending, and helps lower your bills so you can grow your savings. You think that's the one that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me over right now for my awesome PSL event? Yeah. How much is it again, dude? $20 a month. So that that's like just log into Xbox Live. Okay. Well, uh does it do anything else besides uh ruin my awesome land event? It it uh Well, it caught the fact that YouTube TV upped their charge from like $70 a month to 90. Wait, it monitors if they make it more expensive, too. Yeah. Yeah. Really useful. I didn't know it did that. It actually gives you a little warning in a day countdown to when you're going to get the charge and the amount it's going to charge you for. So, if the subscription price goes up, you got to, you know, you can see that. Wow. Well, I'm going to get your account cancelled. Uh, Rocket Money has over 5 million users. Actually, it has one less now. Uh, and has saved a total of $500 million in cancelled subscriptions at my expense, saving members up to $740 uh a year when using all the apps features. Well, you can cancel your unwanted subscriptions and reach your financial goals faster with RocketMoney by going to rocketmoney.com/theyard, guys. Uh, which I don't want you to do anymore. You're fine. I'm unless if I use rocketmoney.com/yard, will I also find an Xbox Live subscription on my account? No. He's using your second. He's using Lwigs. He's using that cuz we're in an ad. So, go ahead and encourage me to use rocketoney.com/yard. Yeah, go to RocketMoney, but do it in about 2 hours. Go to rocketmoney.com/theard and uh um find your dreams are all going to come true there. They're all going to come true. Let's get back to this awful episode of Nick Ball where I hope that something terrible happens to the guy that's not in the chair anymore. Wow. Round 13. Let's get right into it. Rank these Lwig fits best to worst. The goal is to match my ranking as close to possible. Best to worst. You can get your whiteboards out. probably be helpful here. Here they are. Wow. A lot to see here, dude. And G, you look like kid in play. That's crazy. I got such awesome fits. A lot going on here. I was so cool over the years. From best to worst, but as a trying to match what I think best to worst. Okay. All right. I have my list. You got yours? You done? Two, three, four, five, six. Yeah, man. I I'm just awesome to look at, huh? Yes. It must be fun every time it No. Yes. True. Yes. You're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] beautiful, man. If you watch like all the compilations of the show, the first few years are cycling between your outfits and my hair and every clip is radically different. Yeah, there's always something going on. All right, everyone show. Sorry the audio listeners here. This one is definitely a video bit. Here's the key. Oh, I was so close. He gets the first one with E. Correct. So, circle circle the ones you get right. Okay. E is lally wearing a Lakers tank top and jean shorts. Jord if you will. He looks buff. He's got a fresh fade. And we can't see the shoes, but I'm assuming they match. Maybe Crocs. Um, number two is G, which is I like to call the the fun ketchup colors. Um, you're wearing basically you're you're basically wearing every color of fun ketchup, but somehow it's working. Dude, I thought that was going to be your favorite. You love that. I love that. You look like you are um who's the goofy character that skateboards? Uh Max. You look like Max. Mhm. I put that as my last one. It's totally critical. The colors are crazy. But the outfit is working at the very like everything fits you well. The It's just, you know, you look kind of cool and with the beanie on a rare Red Bull beanie that I'm liking. Um, a is you got I think that's maybe it's the Kingdom Hearts. It's the Sora shoes with the red shorts. With the red shorts and like maybe a corpse husband shirt or something. I thought this would be a second. Yeah, dude. I was one off on every single one. And did you get any right? I didn't get a single. How many you get right? I got one. You got one right. I also got one. So there's Let me see. Let me see both your lists. No one understands you. You're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] weird. I went G A E instead of E G A and then I went BC H instead of CBD. Lwig wins. His are all closer. Mine are so close. His are all one off. So Lewig's going to win that one. Lewig, you're going to get two. Aiden, you're going to get one. I guess it was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] chopped h then. You just got to put yourself in the ill mind of Nick and then you would understand. It's really just understanding Nick. And I I guess it makes sense. You didn't like these. Thanks. Uh thanks to the the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you uh Discord tier for helping me find some of these. Joe Aabanga and some others. I thought you would hate D to be honest. Um you thought I hate D. It's pretty low down there. I put that third. I thought it'd be your last. Um no. H is egregious, man. You are You actually can't really tell, but you're wearing dress shoes. That's funny. You're wearing You're wearing pajama pants, dress shoes, and then whatever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that jacket is. My Princess Monoke jacket. I knew you'd put S at the bottom. Um, and then F is F is horrible. The attic is different, too, because uh it was whatever he could wear in the house. But for this one, he has to go out of the house, which is different. Um, all right. We're into round 14, and we're pretty close to the end. Sing to me. One of you plays the guitar, one of you sings, and one of you is the band manager, and your guys' goal is to get a record deal. I will play guitar. Nick Ball is so exhausted. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] play. Huh? Can you sing? I can. Well, yes. Yeah, I can sing a little bit. Would you rather sing or manage the band? What? What do you think managing the band looks like here?

Older than me. Well, okay. So, can you tell me a little bit about how like is that based on experience that song or was that? Right. It's just Well, because we both we both came from the small town that we had so many reservations about going back to and I grew up with this young red-haired boy that I always had feelings for. Uh, you always had you always had feelings for him. That always had 14. Well, I'm 14 now and when I was 11, 12, that's when I had the feelings. Long time ago for me. Yeah.

Well, guys, um sign we only have room for a solo artist at the label. Wow. And it looks like love is kind of the full package. I mean, love can play the guitar. Love can sing. Love can also play the piano. Love can play the piano. I'm sorry. I won't do it without Jiz. I told you this boy drives a hard bargain. But I say, sir, you will not be disappointed. But he will. But we will do it without our manager. Yeah, that's true. We'll cut the manager. Speak. Yes. Why am I southern again? I don't know when I became southern. The voice is just fun to do. I started off this sketch rather soft spoken now. Boys, we have a deal. Put her there. Put her there. Well, goddamn root and tooting. Son of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] And the best part is we're paying you a nick coin. Great work, T. I didn't know you could play chords. Yeah, I can play chords. It's great. That shit's easy. And I did Harry Potter. All right, round 15. This is episode one. All come from places of deception. And one of his favorite bits is going to Starbucks and asking for the work. He says, he goes, he goes, "Hey." He goes, "Hey, hey, give me oatmeal." He taps, "Hey, give me oatmeal. Give me oatmeal." And I'm like, "Okay, don't do that. I'll get you oatmeal." And I'm like, "Yeah, can I get one oatmeal?" And he goes, "Hey." And and ask for the works. And I look at him and I say I say, "If I look at this speaker in the drive-thru and I I ask for the works, are they going to know what I'm talking about?" And he's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah." And I'm like, "Yeah." And I'll can I get Can I get those with the works? You make him say and and they're like, "What? Excuse me?" and love loses his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mind. Classic the works bit. Describe. So, go ahead. Go ahead. What you say? Well, when you get the works, it's cuz you can get nuts and dried berries and blueberries and honey. They don't call it that. Lovely. No, they don't. But all three could be called the works. Describe and draw the perfect ice cream cone with the works. It is not important that Nick would like it himself and points are going to be given on creativity. So it's you don't have to make [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Oreo cuz you know I like Oreo. I see. You can make whatever you draw the perfect ice cream. Draw the perfect ice cream cone. Okay, I'm done. We got Anthony done first. All right. I feel good about my cream. Let's go one at a time. We're going to start with Aiden. Aiden, show me your cream. Oh my god. Show the camera, too. What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] am I looking at? What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is that? Why do we make ice cream complicated? Is not the most desirable cone. Simple vanilla one. Describe it to me. Lick. Describe it to me. See, here's the cone. The cone of a man. Simple. The divots in the cone that are rather common. It's rare you would get a flat cone. It's uh it's usually some sort of pattern. So, as you can see, there's a basic ice cream cone and then the best the best scoops overflow over the edge. Right. Right. They're a little wider than the top of the cone. What's the line? What are actually amazing villain you've drawn and then and then that right there is the single cuz cuz what's you wouldn't want it to be bare and just vanilla. It's true. You want a single sprinkle on it. one decorative. Show it to me again. Something to be enjoyed. Can you show it to me again one more time? Stole my heart with that drawing. Yeah, it it is crazy drawing. I mean, it it it just looks a lot like a man's penis. It looks like the head of a penis being pulled out of a fire. Says who you talking about? It looks like the head of a penis being pulled out of a fire and it's getting bigger. It looks like Pac-Man had arms and legs and he is licking a man's penis. That when Pac-Man goes into public domains, this is what a video game is going to be. I don't understand. What was the point of me describing the cone and you're just going to say it's a penis? All right, that's true. You've taken so much of the autonomy of the argument. Wait, I'm so sorry, Loig. Let's see yours. Here we go. Oh my goodness. It looks delicious. It's a delicious ice cream cone. Wow. Okay, describe it to me. Uh, yeah. It's just your cl I'm a real creamer, so this is what I'd be looking for. It's uh you have the cone. Cream it up for me, Lwig. This is producer. Cream it up. You hear that before a young boy song. You going to cream it. Yeah. It's from Nick Inc. It has the wrapper. It's a waffle cone. It's one big awesome scoop of salted malted chocolate chip cookie dough. All the cookie doughs behind the sheen of vanilla so you can't see it. Uh and then on top is a big awesome cherry sprinkles. And it's gone. Ow. What's the last part? What does it say at the bottom? Huh? It says Nick Inc. at the bottom. You said Nick ink at the bottom. Sprinkles and sprinkles. It's what's awesome. Cherry, sprinkles, and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I missed that. I missed it the first time. He says it fast. You said it. There's sprinkles and there's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Why' you put [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on the Why would you put [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on the ice cream? Cuz it's supposed to be the best toppings you could possibly have. Huh? From who? So, I didn't tell you the best part. If you eat this, you get $10,000. Okay. So, so it's a challenge. It's a Well, it's a treat, actually. It's like you get to earn that. The BaskinRobins 31 in challenge. Yes. Yes. But instead of having to eat That's weirdly what they also call mine. Insane amount of calories, you can eat a high protein meal and win money. The BaskinRobins Pete Holmes challenge. All right, let's see it. Uh, okay. So, this is uh Jesus. The cone. Wow. And then um it's Nick's mom. And is she saying a phone number? That's my phone number. It's so funny to write your own phone number and then show it. She's just like she's just saying what her favorite phone number is. It's mine. And then uh she's and she's and she's holding two frisbees. No, no, she's she's topless, right? And those are huge breasts. She You know she'll watch this, right? Yeah. You know she watches all the episodes. Well, if that's the case, right? Your phone number is the number. Yeah. Okay. I mean, to be fair, it's an awesome waffle cone. You have to give them that. Really good cone. I mean, it's like the best crunchy. How big is the cone to scale? Is it It's the size of a person. It's big as a beautiful. I mean, she is 55 for a woman to fit inside. She's not 5'5, you know, when like it's it feels similar to when Caesar would have a large cake brought in and a boy would burst out of it. Or when they made the horse of wood. Yeah. It's like the horse of wood. Anyway, uh so yeah, this is my perfect You want to keep this? No, I don't want to keep You can have you hold on to that? I'll keep it. Why do you want to keep it? Oh, so I can't keep things. Let him keep some art. I'll take The boys love my art. He doesn't need it. He wouldn't know what to do with it. Yeah, he would have the Pac-Man guy hang out with her. I'm thinking about putting these two on my wall. All right, guys. All right, listen up. It's not important that Nick would like it himself. Points are based given based on creativity. Just reading the rule on the screen right now. I just want to say before you make your decision, it would be interesting if you yourself didn't like my cone. That you were vocally against my cone that I presented. What's wrong with the cone? It's just a penis. H Oh, that you wouldn't want to eat the ice cream that I drew. Not important that Nick would like it. Oh, okay. You didn't read the rules. Let's just divvy it out. Most creative goes to slime. And he gets two for that. And he gets two for that. That's good. I had a rule. The second is Lwig. All right, Aiden. It was It was just a penis. I gotta say, Aiden's my favorite. Slime already did. He described it so well. Earlier on the show, Slime drew a penis on the whiteboard. Well, hold up. That was That was the head of a penis being pulled out of a fire. It was way cooler than just I think it was a bush. That's even cooler. What was the bottom of your cone? That was the little napkin that goes at the bottom of the cone. Oh man. What's wrong with you guys? So nice of you. All right, guys. We're in the final round of Nick of Nick. Thank [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] god. I'm sorry. Awesome. What the hell was that? Awesome. 200th episode. Uhoh. A ballistic missile purchased from Iran and paid for with Nickcoin just evaporated Ben Affleck's gorgeous Brentwood home. This is a good thing. I think this would raise the would probably be purchased from the US. Bitcoin is quadruple value. It just quadrupled in value. How much you got? He's got like 12. I think I sweet. I think I take your whole bowl. What do you got? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13. Someone do that math for me. 24. Okay. I have 52 Nitcoins. You don't even have enough. 52 Nick coins. No, we're going to have to go digital. We're going to have to go. There's It's a cryptocurrency. It's not digital. Nick, there's not 52 in that. This bucket represents the rest that you need. Yeah. And this is your 18. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. All right. So, can I buy food with this? So, the current standings are Slime has 52 Nickcoin. Lwig has 18 nitcoin and is in second place. And Aiden, how much money you have? I have 13 fiat. How much How much is a a Nickcoin worth to a dollar? $1. I would like to exchange for what? $24. $2,400. 24 of the big bucks. You want Oh, you want to I want to go to fiat. I want to cash out. I'm selling. There's a gas fee. What's the fee? I mean, he's diversifying his portfoly. That's Well, you can I said you can do whatever pretty much everything you want except unless you don't have enough of the prop that you brought for the game, right? Yeah. Well, Amazon one day shipping um really limited when you do it that way. But they had these. Yeah. Um you want one of these for me? Thanks. Um All right. Final round for real. In a few sentences, summarize your time recording the show. What you've cherished, what you look forward to, and how you've grown. No one loses this round. It's 200 episodes, guys. He's yawning. Four years. Four years. Boo. You guys had fun. Man, have you guys had fun doing our show for this long? I think if it were up to me, we would have stopped doing this show a long time ago. That's so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] false. because because I hate doing things for too long cuz I feel a weird sense of like shame. But the fact that we kept it going because obviously it changed our lives with how much money we make despite your instincts. Despite my instincts, I feel like the show has grown into an interesting place that would otherwise not have existed comedically even though we retain the same core comedic sense. that I think is I cherish that and it's not because of the money. Uh and you have to believe me because I sleep on the floor. Slimebot has spoken. Uh Lwig, what do you think? You know, the show's outlived a lot of podcasts if you think about it. Sandwich in the dirt. Died in the span of our podcasts. Uh whine about it. Died came back to life in the span of our podcast. Jesus Christ. Wow. Uh, Trash Taste got cancelled. Yeah, sucked the whole time. Oh, yeah. Just never I don't think it ever started. Might as well have not existed. You know, if you think about the career span of a podcast, we're we're we're hitting status. Yeah, we're we're deep in it. Wow. We're an uncle pod and I can only pray one day uh we truly hold up to our word and release D and D. unrelated feels like to the No, it's related. 200 episodes is crazy. Before the 200 We got episode 200 before DN D. That would have been a joke. We got episode 200 off camera. Smile. Hey, when was when when was the first D and D like leak or announcement made? What episode? What? Like 6 months ago. Like was it episode like 50 or something? Like how old? It was like a year ago. It was over a year ago. You know, I watched the first episode back and uh we make a a reference to Trump almost getting assassinated, which must have just happened. How many people do you think How many people think died? Oh, who listened or had babies? Oh, both. If you combine those numbers, at least 30. We got a new pope before we got the yard DND. So, anyway, that's what I want to end on. Aiden, I think even after all this time, what makes me very happy about this show is I come in, you know, usually every Monday and I'm excited to be here and talk with you guys. And I'm very happy that this gets to be the link that sort of keeps us together as we've all gone in our different directions and moved and moved on to different things that we work on and we've grown up and we're different people than we were four years ago. And even as all of that has happened, we still come in every week and we spend two hours with each other and then an hour again the next day and all of us go and we get to and all of us go every time and we make each other laugh and I don't take that for granted because I think there's a lot of people I really like and appreciate. Start another podcast but I still come here every time because I want to be here. If you had to quit one, who would you quit? Say it. Lemonade. Wow. Let's go. That's all I need forever. Yeah. Yeah. That's all I need. Dude, why is it called a creamy one for Aaron's birthday? It's a Tik Tocker who farts for Aaron. It's a Tik Tocker who farts.
