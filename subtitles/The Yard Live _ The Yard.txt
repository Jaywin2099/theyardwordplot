do it I'll do it I'm bald I'll do it everyone deferred to me the only one that could pull the sword out of the stone and shave his head he looks like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what's the guy from the Smur gar garl how do you know his name cuz everyone kept saying in chat yeah makes sense dude dude Aiden would like be off the set like you know walking around drunk eating pizza staring out a window the things he does usually when he's drunk just minding his own business and people would be like sneaking pictures of him just like just cuz he looked so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up yeah I've seen between this and the screenshots from the stream I have seen my head from every angle imaginable they got your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mapped they could put in a video game yeah yeah they there's a 3D scan right now you're going to be in a Madden there's never been a better time to put my name into mid Journey it's yeah you look like the toy that scares Buzz in Toy Story yeah yeah something no no that's a new one do you like this cuz it doesn't stop that's to be it's not because not because I'm bald it's because of the way you shave my head no the toilet scared Sid is just a baby's head on a spider uh got some hair it's got some hair it looks like that and to be clear Aiden you I look like kind of scammed I sent I sent zipper I scammed why is that cuz he has some hair shave bald it's not bald it's not to

zipper Zipper was at the that station for 12 hours doing transition doing tricks on it for 13 hours absolutely doing the trans I didn't I got to like go back and click through the stream for a little bit I was looking at some of the moments that I was in and didn't get to watch and I'm like wow like we're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] being there's like circles you see like Aiden's face in the corner yeah dude it was there's like Fades and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like it was a Arcade Fire I didn't know we even could do that I didn't know we had the technology and well okay two things first off welcome back to the art episode 100 second 100 what is happening cuz the VA is gone and people are sad what happening probably cuz I don't know maybe like 83 Royalty songs or like so is it gone forever and they can never

Brazilian straight up come if you're obsessed with anything you're either a girl or Brazilian either Fury two option or or mcwt uh yeah so it'll it'll come back but back to Aiden scam okay Aiden Aiden scam now here's where I'm at I actually don't think he needs to shave it to the Bone okay oh your line of reasoning is so funny too well it's cuz I we were at Shake J's birthday party last night mhm I bailed you did bail it was funny I actually thought you were going to go it was funny it was and I was sad weren't really there I was sad that's all I was you were sad I was sad I was like said that I didn't show up yeah for shake cuz I thought you would crack for him I thought he would pull you it was close Shake can I just say shake had potentially the worst birthday they fit on possible no it was I got I got it it's it's it could never leave please he's wearing a ring a white wrinkled shirt that he probably wore to bed last night and kept on today of a gangster Mickey Mouse yep no no sorry that is it was the Mickey Mouse kingom Hearts Yeah Yeah from Kingdom Hearts the Kingdom Hearts Mickey Mouse with the hood that's not dude the organization 133 Mickey Mouse that he's calling gangster

tight pants on lot tight pants he's got a lot of tight he a check and then he's got socks and sandals indoors yep money so like the the you can see like the the what's it called the thong going into the sock like H did he arrive at this this costume this is again sandals not SL so to be clear he lives here so he he he spawned like that he was the worst dressed person at his he dressed like differently and then the night went on much like Aiden at the rockathon and it more outfits just same outfit whole time startend and then Alex smokes mid shows up he's wearing a Rolex it's a hand-me-down and Shake sees the Rolex and goes you just wait here and he comes out with Rolexes Shake's got two or three he comes out he's like he's like look at my watches he goes this one he's like this one Mogul moves 2,000 2 million subscribers I think it was he bought it for himself he bought it for himself oh I didn't get him a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Rolex you asked once can I get poite and Shake Rolexes in back in like 202 did I get him a Rolex uh I don't know you asked me and I said yes damn I'm nice I I don't know if you did though I don't even have a Rolex I don't think you pulled the trigger I might have I don't think you did you treat them too good you got a cool ring on I haven't seen that one dude I was uh cutie got me this oh is the from the same Gucci colle I got cutie a board game for Christmas she got me a Gucci bracelet you keep saying this but you got her the cool Halo bag last year oh that bag's cool I use it all the time she doesn't even have it yeah I just that was last year so cool that you stole it yeah I take all her that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I I got I got her code names with pictures come on that's kind of lit I don't think the trade would books they have picture there's no words it's a different kind of game it's actually worse it is it is I looked at it I was like this looks not as fun it's just not no code names is fun because it's names yeah CU you could hit a jackpot do you guys remember at 8:22 p.m. if Shake was wasted or not not not at a20 I don't think he was ever like not at 820 like hammered no well at one point he went to smoke then he got crossed oh you know what no there was a point where he said hey check this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out and then he went over to turntables that he has in his living room and he put on headphones and he proceeded to look at his laptop not touch the turntables and Nod his head but he was not doing a bit he was seriously DJing but he didn't put his hands on the turn funny as he keeps going I forget to who like random people he's like yo can you throw a couple songs on cuz he's playing beer pong and then and then and then everyone would be like I don't really know how to do it and he be like fine I'll DJ my own party he kept going over to add song and he just add songs to the playlist guess I'll just DJ I guess I guess I got really good taste dude I don't know what it is about Shake drizzle I haven't seen a lot of some friends I have who like I've seen drunk before but I haven't seen drink in a while they were all drunk at this party everyone was drunk at this party yeah loens them up I heard I heard that everyone got pretty trash literally everyone was they went they all I they all went to a bar after Josh's girlfriend there's a huge crew well that's that's because they they drank so much that they ran out of beers and seltzers and I know this because bun walks up to shake and goes la la last beers and then Shake goes I'll take that one and then and then M's like no no no you don't get it there are no more and Sh goes there're seltzers and then I was like you don't get it this is the last two and so I guess that's when they decided to go B your editor also very drunk at this party uh somehow got it in his brain that every hour he owes me a compliment so every hour he'd come up and show me the phone to show me the time and then he'd give me a compliment and he kept saying I have a 50-page document and I didn't get the details on what that meant for a while and then I eventually got there he's got a 50-page document of ideas for both you and for the yard whoa and I'm like polite I'm G be real with you if the first three pages don't bang oh you started reading it no he hasn't shown me yet he just keeps he kept talking about it I'm going to tell you right now his ideas bang his ideas is bad he they bang oh they bang he's got good ideas okay really I know this yeah yeah he he started I'm doing a trend of videos which is like honestly reviewing X yeah and so he started that I think his was like reviewing YouTubers products which maybe sound simple but then when you start going down it's like okay you got YouTubers products YouTubers games uh sponsors that YouTubers sponsored by so I got a treasure TR of stuff to work with the sponsor the sponsor one was really good taking all the like common sponsorship stuff or stuff you've been asked to like plug for and then just reviewing them instead it all started there so he got is there YouTube sponsored robot for throat [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what are you asking for it's like how do I take part in this now how do I how does the conversation go from my side you know I'm just asking oh I'm sorry do I not get to do I not get to ask a question to an expert last month a professional last month on X Boston Dynamics

last time I ever talked to uh toad he was in a Discord call he posted this picture and he said how to hide come from your parents and I thought it was the funniest thing crazy yeah when was that this was 2020 wow this is like five years ago dude so uh last night during Shake's birthday I was I was streaming League of Legends cuz I have I just wanted to play and I fired it up and then by the way I was watching you stream League of Legends when I got a text from Shake saying where are you cuz I forgot the party was happening and I was doing that dude I that's cuz I did that here's how I remembered because Shake wanted his birthday to be Saturday he messaged me he's like you he he sent me the party full link and I was like Saturday's a rockathon and he's like oh I was like you should come by the rockathon letting you know by the way he's like okay I'll just move it to Sunday then I'm streaming League of Legends I get a text on my phone I'm up 21 on the Ops and he just he it's shake and he says did I see you outside my place just now I was on the balcony and it wasn't me if he's on the balcony he's high I was thinking he might have saw Aiden maybe this happened this is a real thing that happened I can't believe this already I'm at the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] basketball Park two kids come up they say yo look can I get a picture I say sure and then I'm taking a picture of them you're on the court they point to you in your head and they goes that's slime dude and they could have been [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with me but I don't think they were Aiden I don't think they were how's a person going to act that well if they not a professional actor it just doesn't I feel like it's not the same like take it off I feel like it's different I haven't shaved content warning yeah oh we have Caleb in the other room too we could get something going was it's kind of close after what Elon did on that damn Podium I guess in the brain you have a similar amount of hair not going to lie that true mine is going to grow though it's going to grow and expand well it could not grow as well don't know probably well you guys remember what I looked like when I had to shave my or grow my hair out for the Tony star dude it looked like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I looked like Aiden did on the stream it sucked it it was a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I remember you hated it I hated it so bad so back to it Aiden scammed back to it at the party we're talking about it and and I'm asking Aiden why he's scamming why didn't you shave it to the ass Aiden and and and he's and he's doing he's doing this whole piss pissy fit and I goes it because you're girl and he goes no zipper 3 doesn't even mind Z zipper 3 doesn't like she's got no problem with this oh she and so then girl so then I'm well so I'm giving him I'm giving him right I'm giving him a whole lot of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm like well then you got to do it zipper 3 comes over I'm like well I heard you uh you don't mind this cut she goes that's not what I said she almost threw up she she was making she was making gag noises gaging yeah yeah she hates it bro yeah I don't think she even likes you very much I'm going be real she hates it after the rockathon I can't believe this I I know you're listening right now I know you're listening and I'm not and I I want to out her so bad I want to Sayo after Rock you come up to me you're you're you're cashed out obviously we all are and you said you got to do one last thing for me dude I was like what he's like you got to shave the rest I hated it off instantly sure and was the look or the feel uh the look what no it looked like good so good like a Greek a philos a Greek man it was the most disgusted I've ever been with myself that's not true it was we've been more disgusted I know you've been disgusting before man and this is the most disg Mex it was worse Mexico when you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] brains out in an open concept bathroom dud you know what have been really cool by the way in that if you just went out and bought a diaper and and just kept the trip going just kept [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that would be cool well the diaper isn't for just wearing you keep wearing it it just catches the P exactly you could probably do like a reusable like a like a one one siiz fit all Z we should make reusable diapers and then I for adults y put it in the wash dude yard reusable diaper reusable diaper anyway we call it yard waste you have you have to learn about girlfriend code girlfriend code which is you hit a certain stage where a girl likes you and outside of doing wrong you can really do no wrong so like if you have a bad outfit or bad haircut or whatever the worst reaction they'll give you is that's okay I don't mind it yeah that's the bottom that's the worst but you're misinterpreting that apathy as it's not bad from like slime which is way different cuz he'll say vitriolic things it's not bad is a pretty good day for me yeah from me but for your girl I don't know man she might girl is lowy a hater dude she's a hater she'll she'll be like you look like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's different now things are different now and they be back but right now they're different dud that's what I thought I went up to her after the rathon she wanted to shave it by the way I was about to and she's like can I do it I'm like yeah sure and she did it and then he's all done and he's like ready to go home and I go up to her I'm like would do you if he did this for permanent like would you stay with him if he was like this permanently she's like no before I finish the that's crazy finish the not even if I were a worm if I just happened to go through mail close to you're the closest to a worm you'll ever be would you still love me if I was a bald no she kept doing this thing where she would like what this is she was doing it that night and the next day where she would like go up to me and she'd be like this is my future that's sweet oh my God she PE the bed last night she PE the bed last night so how about that truth Aiden you can't use that c she pissed the dude how about that no platform to defend herself this is Warfare oh god dude you know she's going to fire back she's going to fire back way too big that's the thing but the thing is is he's got a bigger gun he says to the people it's true it's true imagine imagine cuz we like to keep our he's stress eating right now he's stress eating you thinking about it I just launched a nuclear war you did you know what happens nowold War over Budd take later in the in the little the little episode editing chat he's going to be like can you cut this random time stamp out nothing in specific mess charie directly make sure not to watch it as well yeah yeah I don't think cutie likes the red too much really I don't think she's the biggest fan I mean it's not very well done what would she rather have Swift like bark at you he did bark a lot at me and I keep forgetting I have it so everyone's like whoa the hair and I have to remember every time I'm like oh yeah cuz I can't see my own hair would she rather have you bald or like that right like this for sure that's what I'm saying you was anti- Ball please yeah God God forid just just the thought like you know knock on [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah I'm shuttering I'm be bad right I would kill myself yeah time I would kill myself how the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] would I go outside that Mak sense with a gun yeah no like it's aggressive it be against the wall my brain my brain cuz i' want C I would want them to see my head it's not that bad that's what I would want yeah okay I'd rather sever all hours of the day i' probably drink a rare poison well you don't have to so what happened to poisons I don't know I feel like we stopped doing poison we just started shooting people low key I feel like that's the C and I feel like poison would work poison would work bring back poison bring back poison BB how come only rats get poisoned that's not fair I want to poison the rats in my life what were you saying Aiden are there can can I eat rat poison and live or is it like a little bit does it work like Advil like it knows where the pain is and it goes to it no no I think it's all dosage you can eat a little bit I can eat a little bit of RIS tiny little bit of in the same way you could eat like you know like the apple seed thing nope what are you talking about apple seeds contain like a TR amount of cyanide yeah yeah yeah but the amount of apple seeds you have to eat are so ridiculous you could you would die from it's kind of like it's like your farts like they got they got a certain amount of like methane and you get like in sulfur you know sulfur is what makes it smell if you inhale too much technically you could pass out but you don't make enough pois poison is simply just an amount maybe it is sulfur not methane one of us might be on the precipice of making enough we can make a poison I think we we should make a yard making a diaper or a poison go can we pick cuz I'm bored V CH vote we we we had such an awesome stream two days ago and now I'm just bored else and then we desperately need a new merch product we should take the money and not donate it and we should make a awesome poison the first sour poison we have to make a decision okay we got matched by Josh broland shout out shout out JB Thanos shout out JB Thanos all right because of that I thought it was CGI the whole time he looks like that for real that's his real chin he is a real Scot the director really wanted to change a chin was No Country for Old Men CGI surgery he had a Zack Efron situation oh no anyway body dismorphia he does got it he's like I really want a big a big ball Chin Chin JB God bless his heart match so technically we passed our last Milestone but we didn't pass the Milestone within the confines of the stream you get what I'm saying here do you get what I'm getting at yeah we had our last Milestone which is yard live at 250k yard live at $250,000 we didn't hit 250 236 we got 227 okay and then Josh matched 227 so we passed 250 with his match right does that count to do the yard live I said no well you want to know you want to know my counter argument oh please you counted the yards match towards the Milestone goal that's true so why would this be different because during the stream thank you Aiden that's a really good point it came during the stream during the stream cuz like what look if it was if it was slime dresses Homer let's say that was our 250,000 goal would slime be doing that offline right now let me ask you a question let me ask you a question if we did not get the match from JB from jhb Team jhp team and do you think jhp and Josh B are the same person no one's balding yeah jhp was Thanos as whole okay yeah okay um if we didn't get the match but then the stream ended and then people kept donating and we hit 250 would you do the yard live so ridiculous even think about if we nuted if we they kept sucking yeah that's what I mean if we nut and they kept why did she keep sucking why would she do you don't need to keep sucking hypothetical I feel like I should enjoy it the meme says it's good but I don't really like it it's too much I would rather just end it now I would say no I would say no I would stand firm what if they said wait I only donated because I saw the goal on the website it's there and before jhb and and then I put the money in and now well I don't get it the money I I would say I would say take it back from charity take it back from charity I'd probably do a voice take it back from charity idiot I'd probably like drink this awesome thing Elixir I poon poison out drink no one uses that anymore why would it cuz I think we set the context during the stream that it was what happened dur like if we didn't hit it we wouldn't do just like we set the context for five stars probably probably star system dude you're I did that you can go back and find the clip I said before anyone we're going to go by stars then percent rock paper scissors LG on this I said this out loud and you guys pretend that I didn't no no no no no you said it out loud thank you zipper for the thumb up get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] no one thinks you no one thinks you didn't say it what is e my God sex that was only Homer can do that Homer sexo mid shot I think the confusion lwig comes from you said that but then we all said no that's bad but then we started just going by percent NOP yes we [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] did for some time nope and then at some point you reverted it he reverted it when we weren't in the room it was some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cou [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] exactly what happened it was like Hong Kong he closed the door young gravy was in here he's like yo young gravy by the way it's Stars Isn't that cool he's wasted he's like yeah yes okay he's like can I just have the shot caller again please I need it I need to be shock please pleas y'all mad I laid down the law you didn't lay down the law you made up the law as it went so you so you think I should have done something different I think you should have abided by the the Democracy of us now that I think about you didn't lay down the law you pH you waited until mom left the room so you could ask Dad and Dad was young gravy I'm saying you dropped your phone I'm not looking it's not like a GU I'll never look I'll never get it if it's down there I don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] need it not even going to look is it down here oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] did you look at that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] his phone's in his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lap bro I didn't look at it you can pick it up pick it up damn I'm going to punch you in the face after this for that wouldn't go well wouldn't go well with that ring that thing is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] big that be branded right across your skull that is cool I'd put five booms I think we need romantic poisons not just not just ones that hurt people we need ones that like do Rome jul does it still well so it doesn't hurt people maybe poison Olympics you think potion was just MDMA poison Olympics where does MDMA come from oh maybe you know what the real Poison is comes from probably Tik Tok probably probably not being celibate till marriage it's like kind of a poison why are you laughing so much over there you just jumping between two different conversations there's only one happening man it's all poison man St in this is poison is it poison are you listen dude yard the yard poison for your ears when is it a potion I want a book I want a book that's a i when it helps you you a Potion No cuz a potion can incur malice it's made in a laboratory did you not know this no I thought it was from a plant no you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] didn't here's why cuz when the rainforest fundraiser happened with Maya she was like so the rainforest is good cuz the plants you can Harvest them for uh drugs that C cure cancer it could help treat cancer and you next to me turned to me and said is that real and I said yeah and you said I thought it was just made in a lab wait so that's what I'm saying so now I thought everything came from Plants but it turns out some are from Labs yeah some things are not all the same there are some things that are different I thought it was a cat all you that it was a catch I thought I had learned something new and now it's both both both sometimes why do you want to do Molly now no I wanted to do the plant of Hemlock to give to my lover JY loves you more Hemlock that's the one that kills I would not give Hemlock to my lover I want to be clear if anyone's watching CU I would not nervous trembling my nervous trembling at vomitting dry mouth do not poison cutie I'm not going to poison her just give her a potion I'm going to give her a potion yeah when does it become a potion when it does good stuff I think no I just said that but told poison no no PO potions can't be poison that's poison potions can incur malice they can incur malice no are you kidding me no they want's an Elixir then Elixir can [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] confused Elixir can only be Elixir are for res oh they oh yeah they also last 30 minutes they Elixir can't have malice I think I think potions can pois always I think potions can't a poison can never help potions can be ambiguous all rectangles are yes squares yes s so the the the scale of morality goes Elixir always good potions can or cannot be but it depends poison always bad this is easyest I think that's fair but I think potions lean good otherwise we wouldn't abbreviate them pots can I get a pot yeah you're right I think that's true you wouldn't pop a pot if it would could be bad for you you wouldn't say that so frequent it's a gamer thing oh okay uh for my birthday I want a book with book leaves and what they are do you to you want like a do you want us to like get the leaves I want like leatherbound book it's thick all right and when I open it thud and I can scroll through and and find you know Titus Kampus yeah Peruvian tree shrub that makes you you wouldn't read it bro would you yeah would you open this book sit there on your coffee table invasive questions okay that means no so what we could do just make the cover I've had this happen to me and I do find out and I'm not happy when I find out someone made a book called uh the story of lwig and it was just 5 foot n repeating that was 300 Pages yeah I found out expensive prank I found out the b found out cuz you open not expensive I learned how much longer after receiving it did you find out within minutes no you know why cuz you probably flipped through it I flipped through it we got to somehow make it so if he flips through it we we're trying to do the least amount of work possible for this stupid book that how come we don't measure babies by height just just ounces we did we did when Braun was born what like how come it's like oh I had a baby he's 1 foot two I think it's cuz they don't stand straight yeah they can't stand up we can stretch them that's see that's the problem is when you say stuff like that imagine now you have a baby and you're saying we can stretch stretch him cuz you wouldn't want to have a small baby be I got to find out what heid he is if you look up the Greek guy who stretches people to 2 m that's what you are you know you could I think it's you could have it like a baby on a marionette like puppet yeah and you could stand it that'd be fun can what do you guys have a kid so I can tie absolutely not wait wait wait make it wait wait wait wait wait going back to an old lwig thing you said that if you have bad posture and you hunch and then you work out a lot that it makes you taller yes you were now taller so if a baby isn't isn't straight up and down that's its height still I know but it's so we got to

nocturnal Amish you're yourself cuz you have them all the time where the dream was just like weirdly like innocuous or what yeah like just like you dreamt about a cabinet and then you woke up and just 100% you remember once it's not even about the content the thing about the nocturnal emiss is like you don't last long what do you mean what does that even mean like something can happen to you in a dream and it's it's like the Lonely Island song it's like you J your pants yeah it's genuinely like you know I brushed up against a desk and then I woke up and I'm like oh gr to it's everywhere what

huge well he tells me on stream all the time he's like wait I saw it I heard he is three I saw it what's mang what's Mango's meat like it it was in my it was in my own pool oh yeah remember that all the boys were hanging out and Mango's penis was out you're right just stripped full nude to be honest I forget what it looked like couldn't have been that memorable unfortunately I have a picture of him from the other side on my phone I remember that I got men and blacked I think yeah yeah maybe it was the penis itself he looks like Bigfoot running through the forest it is a Bigfoot image well that's awesome we we had a good time the last past couple days together haven't we fellas I enjoyed it it was good I enjoyed Rock say people say why best performance of the night Come On Everybody Wants to Rule the World was the best performance of the night I not speaking fluent Spanish that that one we have to that's why the is can I just say I would have I would have killed that much harder cuz I do believe I did kill it if rock band didn't break up the you know how hard it is to read Spanish when it's only two letters at a time and they're breaking up all the I'm like what is the word yeah yeah that's why it is why I can read Spanish I don't mean singing a whole song in German dude singing when you don't know the song it's so I went back watch I went back and watched the dooh host oil up sesh and it was it was too erotic I won't lie there's going to be some awful content I've been saying so frequently like keep your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pants on all right you started it excuse me

insurance I fold I rarely take it really counts bad right now yeah feeling it people people keep saying stuff like you guys should do this more often but I think the fact that we never do stuff like

saying that yeah what do you mean well we almost got this what does t have what does TK have and what do we get that you think is going on here what are you talking about what are the numbers give me the numbers Mason uh 18K for TK slightly under we had more no he had like under 18K no because his stream had the same amount as ours he had more at the time I kept checking I was like who are we

Reddit look up nocturnal r/ nocturnal am missous it's a Reddit that's got to be an awesome nocturnal emission has got to be an awesome subreddit dude I bet people are grinding it away or trying to get better at it yeah people are probably dropping like cups D dude I looked I dude what cups Cups where that cup of I told you get right I he gets H yeah yeah yeah that was not nocturnal that was broad daylight it was broad daylight broad day that was just an Amish wow if Elon mus on this website we wouldn't have these problems they they probably shouldn't have posted all pictures in less than 24 hours they're going to post that they're cooperating with Donald Trump to get back it probably got banned during the Reddit Purge yeah dude we were going through random and reddits the other night on Discord and we went to r/ KitKat and there was a guy who had taken it out of the package and said why why isn't it just a bar and we made an account just to say you are lost there's a lot of really awesome subreddit we went to r/ Rick Owens some of the worst outfits on the planet oh come on dude r/ Rick Owens come on it is to be fair a lot of the worst outfits on the planet are in this room with me and slime let's go at least you included yourself don't say with like contempt as if you don't know at least you're included yourself I know I'm there I'm getting better you're not my trory looking included yourself all right I think these are made out of like recycled textbooks this is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Brooks bro there running the bottom is beat uh yeah but it's a running shoe what do you want from me I put I put work in you puts work in sorry uh we were doing a stream today me and Aiden with Doug Doug where we each had to draft a stock five total people money with real 10,000 Financial of your own money of our own money he put it up that much well you don't like get rid of you don't lose it so what happens after you could could you're investing it hard investing it and after a year you take guys awesome prank idea on Aiden please we tank the stocks of we take the stocks of 10 major companies Aiden went very safe he's like his like worst stocks like I'm going to an index fund oh would not take any risks ever you actually weren't allowed to pick index funds oh but I would have then I could downthrow the index fund and then grab I actually I don't know if you had this problem but I I forgot we were doing this so I hadn't prepared or picked out anything prior to this and oh and then also I am the only person in this group of people not streaming who doesn't have their twitch chat giving feedback and making suggests for them I'm just blindly trying to pick stocks in the 10 minutes between when my Mario Kart wiii ended and when the stock thing you're dual you're multiboxing and I'm and I'm just trying to to squeeze out a couple to a couple Banger stocks and what my list is and then no matter what I pick in the call the whole I I was like yeah I think I'll pick Delta Airlines everybody's like ooh what are you doing and but I realized about five in that no matter what the pick is they're going to say this dud Delta's good they just added Shake Shack on their on their PL see they got Shake Shack that's already priced in and and then whatever reasoning you'd give somebody in the call would say that's already priced in without fail Del lwig was getting roasted cuz the first two stocks he picks he picks Amazon and then he picks Nintendo atrio was like are you just looking at things on your desk yeah that's a good I heard you picked Trump dude I picked trumpcoin uh that's probably going a I don't know so here's the thing blood on youring my portfol no I have the only ethical investment fund wow because Stan comes online before his 10th pick and he's just like guys how do we feel about for-profit prisons dude you're Stan and you're the same guy bro what do you have you got some you got like Chevron what got boing you got boing I got cuz they wouldn't kill another guy they of course they would kill another guy more they won't kill another guy won't kill here's my big three here's my big three okay I I got Nintendo I didn't know they were publicly traded famously I I didn't not on the New York Stock Exchange no on the what on the Japanese oh uh Nintendo cuz I think swi swis sh is going to outperform it dropped people think swi sh's not do hot I think it will all right uh this one's a little controversial Trump coin yeah okay but yeah I did for the me going in I was like I'm going Trump coin why don't you buy Melania coin I don't think it's tradeable yet CU it's not avilable and I wouldn't want to then the third one I got United Healthcare St dude what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the matter with you they're not get each stock they're not going to get hit twice you think you think there there's like um night immunity after the mafia like you're not all the healthare companies are the problem and if the way I'm looking at it you know what Healthcare did the most so far I look at it differently they volunteered one this assassin assassinations probably stack so I went with siga a different Healthcare Company because I was like no assassinations last year they're clean Michael Jackson was the biggest he ever was after he died thank you I don't think that's true he's the biggest he ever was I don't think that's number one ever pistle he hit number one he did it well he was the first time in 20 years and it was that was pimus that was ply so wait are you saying United Healthcare they're about to have a big glow up they're about to have a big glow up I didn't know who they were before now everybody wants to and now lowkey you're like I do need Healthcare actually that right now that's the first Healthcare company that comes to mind first one I couldn't name a second dude I'm imagining you know there's like what's up life of a day trader like Tik toks it's that but it's Aiden and it's nothing about day trading it's just him playing Funky Kong on Mario Kart Wii life of AI player no but it says day trader and you're just playing Mario Kart Wii all day and getting mad today we're going to be holding our portfolio and I'm going to be booting up I'm G to be dude I'm going look for a shot I watch a Tik Tok like that it pissed me off it was like stay in the life of a 35-year-old father who wants to be stronger than his younger brother and he goes into the story about his younger brother who's like 6'5 250 lbs and ripped and he wants to be stronger than him and his secret is going to be biohacking in the whole video he just took vitamins and then went to work and then went home and he never worked out and I went that's not going to work well has anyone tried it yes famously that one guy which Guy Brian Johnson oh the guy who's trying to be young forever like most American that guy works out can we stop capping he looks amazing that guy works out he does look he does look amazing yeah he looks amazing he looks amazing he doesn't look as good as the Asian dude though the Asian dude biing Asian D can you look up 5 57-year-old Asian guy who actually looks way Young than 57 but he is 57 for sure all one word dude all one word wow I remember when no not just all one p no don't do that no he looks like you left a piece of pizza in your wallet I was kidding okay I was like I can't tell no I actually don't think he looks bad for his age he looks good I think he looks fine but it's like he looks weirdly like wet yeah Chu that guy he's 57 what this guy looks so good this guy looks like this guy looks like he is good at rock climbing and melee he's turn he turns 59 this year what this this article's a year old that's tight as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah he's born in 66 I know he can you can you just search his name into Google and go images he looks insane I don't think he looks 20 but I do think he looks like 33 yeah God damn that's what did he do I think he just got great jeans probably plastic surgery oh my God look at his body I know wait wait that one says here's his secret to look 25 that's not what I looked like at 25 yeah you don't look like that now you were drinking the water in the Pomona house dude that he looks no I was he looks [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] great [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up I know so this guy mogs Brian Johnson like ABS right there side by side yeah Bri Brian Johnson [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mogged by this guy I do think it's a genetics game he's made he dude Brian Johnson looks like he's a toilet he's just like shiny and like I think it's because his genetics are predisposition to make him look like the whale when he's 60 and he's fighting against that and he's yeah yeah he's the the currents are stronger yeah so for what he should be he's killing we should do this to Aiden biohack him we should try to biohack him I want to make you either that or you're becoming our blood boy which one do you want I want your blood biohack me all right let's biohack I'm this I've decided thought about it for a little bit yeah put me up you're getting older is weird man I'm like looking at my face now and you can like see more lines and like my B like my tits like are drooping and like all kinds of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's not a age thing oh come on they used to be perky they didn't used to be perky don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hurt don't take the breast away from him don't take this away from me he had an awesome rack I had a good perky kiss and now they're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] young I mean but you're you get to the age where it's like you're not 20 as young you just get ripped you you got you're getting some lines in your eyes it's beautiful I'm going get wrinkles but I know I look good you look great I'm just saying getting older you you feel it you can see it and you can feel feel it and it's interesting I think you look Peak at 35 that's crazy to say I believe it it's just not true I believe it my heart Peak if you're in shape of course yeah but I think like you're able to get more in shape at 35 you could I think you're insane I think you're athletic isn't your athletic peak in like early 30s yeah yeah yeah you're okay no wonder I haven't gotten there it's coming 32 I'm going to like start dunking that's not yeah yeah maybe with no practice I fig I think I just need to eyeball it better I feel like the thing is like I look at I'm like not cuz you're always getting the height you're just missing the rim the goddamn thing behind the Rim Yeah if one of you guys have a kid you have to promise I can tie strings around its Limbs and make it like a marionette no I said no the first time you I told you I thought she'd say no to you coming to Mexico I thought she didn't want you to come and I was wrong yeah you and my ini my initial reaction to this is like she wouldn't let you do that but I'm I've been wrong clearly about my hair about you coming to Mexico so slime you can tie strings to the hands of my child and move them like a marionette thank you you and you can say I'm a little baby I'm just say it you don't think you did enough damage with the peeing yourself thing I'm saying you don't think you did enough damage already well you're trying to double down here no you don't need to the diaper would have fixed everything she didn't wear a diaper she just worn a diap dier it would have been fine yeah I guess we'll leave the hemlock poison idea poison diapers well no cuz that's who like the babies will die if it needs to if the baby needs to die needs oh a baby Hitler doesn't get a poison diaper Okay no Okay Okay Hitler no no no no we give the poison diaper to like college Hitler cuz we want the art you know we want we can all name a Hitler painting that we love we the art but we can lose the rest of it I opened I opened Reddit I open Reddit today and I'm you know I'll just open rall to see like what you know what's up that's sick and it's like 12 posts all about the Elon thing and I'm looking at it and I'm like this it just can't be that bad and then you open it and you watch it and he kind of he even winds it up he's like it's like he's starting to lawnmower dude they do that when they're scared Elon only do this when they're extremely stressed freaking out what did Conor say he said like thank God I got Pokemon autism and not Nazi autism oh god oh it's it's isn't it awesome that every social media platform is currently dominated by the rightwing yeah it's really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] awesome and fun and we I and comedy's legal again I think we got to make the yard social yard social poison diapers for everyone it's just more of a social media platform dude get in the mail it's not true say twitch is left leaning Reddit is left media platform that's it's like a media broadcast is reddit is left leaning but it sucks I don't think is is a social media platform oh that's crazy I think it is it is but I don't think twitch is I feel like Reddit is so is so much more separated from the socializing aspect of like it's not really tied to your identity it's more like forums it's definitely not social media forums were social media Facebook is like Facebook Instagram Twitter technically Blue Sky uh those are social media platforms yeah I understand I I I think I get the ethos of what you're saying but I think Reddit just can't not be social media but it's not 100% social media in this definition either why is like is IGN a social media platform no I feel like it's more similar to that than Facebook that's crazy no us generated content that is what makes it a social media platform it's like IGN forums not like IGN oh yeah I figured that's what you meant yeah journalism Out forums are social media but n the way say it right but none of them are like popular enough to part that I agree with you guys is that like it sways popular culture similarly to the way Instagram might on Reddit does social media in this definition need like a giant impact like if we had a yard Forum with 20 diapered out users I do it is so disgusting to me right now now it's like you have to suffer through like years worth of this right-wing talking point of there being no space for right-wing people online having no place to get your ideas out and constantly complaining that even though the trend and the result podcast is right there you could just jump on and listen to Pand and like every mainstream News podcast or like talk show podcast is like right leaning the largest News Network in the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] country is Fox News Right leaning all these social media companies and CEOs right leaning now except except maybe Reddit and except twitch I guess if you even count that it's just so disgusting to like continuously hear that talking point even now and have the landscape be this dominated by like right-wing social media messaging and it made me particularly angry with the fires when I was scrolling through Twitter and being like I this site is it's unusable now I have to scrape through piles of like rightwing like dog [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like uh like dog whistles I have to look at right-wing dog whistles all the time on all of these places it's like I have no none of these sites like are are good places anymore I don't know liberal poison you know [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the liberal poison is blue hair they keep talking they they talk about the liberal poison and it's like no I've I've run out of the liberal poison bring it back I've I've only had the other poison di is liberal poison well I think the other sites suck what are you talking about blue sky and threads yeah they're not like they're swagless fun to you swag it's just juice you're just missing juice there is juice it's cuz Blue Sky sort of exists to like defy elon's Twitter which is like cool but you got George Decay on their posting criid like 900 times a day and it's like that [Music] doesn't maybe maybe maybe you guys don't feel the same way is like Twitter declining and blue sky like having this opportunity to become a platform that more people use it's like I'd rather just not use like this is a great opportunity to just get off the train rather than start using and like get hooked on some new social media site that is ultimately worse T kind of as a concept is kind of bad I mean before it got [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up it was also bad it sucked for your brain and it was cring it's always been bad in those way but I think there was like the the the loss here now or what makes it so frustrating is there was like a you I feel like Twitter did have a utility that the other social media sites lacked that was very nice like when there was an earthquake in LA yeah and everybody no matter where you were in the country you knew if there was an earthquake was fine like in like you know 20 like 14 kind of time because it's like it was just people content wasn't really algorithmically selected it was just like you follow people you see their thoughts yeah in addition it's like I remember I think it was the Crimson blur who said it in a way I didn't it was very succinct when like Elon bought it and elon's like Blaze Your Glory like you can be the you can be the king of Twitter like that was the idea and Crim was like no one wants this people are on Twitter cuz LeBron James is on Twitter they just want to like see what like big people and things are up to they don't want to like you know and then this idea and that kind of pervades into the idea of like yeah you buy an account and then you like start dropping shpping bro and like you use this and like entrepreneurship and it's like to me the blow your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] off smooth the essence of Twitter when I made a Twitter was like okay Instagram's for pictures and Facebook is kind of dying and like your family's on there you go to Twitter because you have like a random funny thought that is like a you don't care if it materializes like you know an Instagram picture it feels like an important post it's like a whole ass picture and it goes in a gallery Twitter is where you throw like 10 thoughts a day into the garbage and see if anyone cares to pick them out yeah you're like stealing all the degenerous jokes you're posting and then like you you know you try to say something funny you say something funny it latches on people retweet it you're like oh people find that funny and you develop like a sense of humor and for me it was like practice practicing ideas on the public there was like there's this yeah you get to explore like real written anything that could be like funny or nothing that is like purely written could really be expressed on the other sites I feel like like you can't disseminate information in the same way that you could whether it be like a joke or talking about an an article or something you're not going to engage with that type of post on like other types of platforms because the photo or the video was always going to be the focus I think also like most social media at the time was about getting people to come to your page like Myspace or what or Facebook but like Twitter was about Landing your thoughts or posts on other people's Pages like they retweet you or whatever yeah and there's a difference there but I think I think what [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it all up was just your homepage being algorithmically selected because then there's a now there's a game to be played it's the difference between creating content for another user who found you because they like things you make and you've like created a genuine follower versus two a user a receiver of content and a creator of content like the Creator is making it for the system that that promotes it and the reader is waiting on the system to provide it I think that's good what part well like I you can switch to following curent right that still exists but people intentionally don't because that page is a lot more bland than the for you page my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] goes the leap the leap I did kind of I mindlessly open Twitter I don't think what tab is it on I just mindlessly open but like I think you're enjoying scrolling enough that it is able to be mindless cuz if you really hated it you would instantly know every time and you'd get mad at yourself if you forgot I think what's happened with me I I I think it's probably true for a lot of people What's happen with me is I open it and I just go oh this sucks I just close the app sure sure sure and that's possible too but I think the bigger issue in my mind is like the paid by Impressions thing because then it's like Impressions at all costs which is a very short-term content minded thing so a lot of people are like just lying yeah it's just like a lot of like lying [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] making [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up reposting popular [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stealing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I think the same thing works I think attention works as a currency the same way though like I think I think people will lie just as much to have their Twitter grow even with no financial gain at the end makes it worse I think it makes it way worse like cuz I think you're right but like the way people seek attention on like Tik Tok is a lot different and I think leads to a lot and like there's still a lot of copying like an insane amount there's also more Innovation I think on that app than Twitter like there's not new [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] coming on Twitter really social media I think the the sad the sort of death of the idea is that social media now and for the kids growing up is seen as a thing to use to like get wealth or like get on the path to like getting out the mud or something in being a place to express yourself and that's all I'll get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on my tweets all the time where people are like bro you're just like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] posting for Impressions he's like dude I promise I don't care cuz like I've been doing this for this whole time you just only can see this utility of social media as something to get ahead with and that's by Design because of everything kind of went that way even YouTube The Yard social fixes all of these problems we we clearly understand understand this oh oh we're listen to this conversation we clearly understand exuse me so we make we make the yard social uh boys have to pay $5 girls free girls free unless unless you bring or some boo in fact if you're a boy you're on the side I ask you uh who do you know here yeah definitely we're definitely leaving porn up that's probably part of it porn's got to stay we love porn everyone get the gun with one bullet you could use it on any user dude we have cool systems one poison diaper is a signed every day oh Poison's going to be involved that's yeah like the old golden cap on Twitch yeah except you die you die it's it's an evil cap a poison cap grla puts it on you gr tusa's Kappa and it deletes your channel okay how about this how about this every user gets a tomato and the Tomato represents a pixel and on any profile you can throw your tomato and it'll make one pixel red and users can use it on any so like Elon Musk his Twitter unreadable red pixels now he's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he has to make a new account yeah there's nothing you can do to undo it it's it's in the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] code it's like it's Bitcoin in there we use the blockchain to cover him in Tomatoes The blockchain and then web 3 is there and then we can sell Trump coin for Ludwick yeah well don't sell we buy we buy low and buy high and we keep buying forever God bless you you know the loser of our contest has to go to New York to Wall Street and run a 5K in a business suit really he's not going to do that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yes but I have a safe portfolio I I'm the least lose I'm also the least likely to win I hope the planet collapses because he has a safe portf you on it yeah okay so you lose yeah that wouldn't make him lose we would just all lose then he certainly wouldn't have to run 5k you really wanted to go down you should hope birkshire haway gets exposed for being a Ponzi scheme great I hope there's a nuclear Hol that you survive you survive got Walmart and you still Walmart survives the nuclear Holocaust for one you think Sam and his family are in a bunker they do dude who are you kidding the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you talking about what do you mean they got bunkers on bunkers I'm not saying the Walmart family is going to die I'm just saying Walmarts are going to be around Walmart is an institution L do I have Chevron yeah oh yeah you have I don't know if it's Chev you have some gas company I don't know what that's not a good company I know but you specifically said most of them bad stuff said I want you made thewi I couldn't get in on Saudi Arco you wanted Saudi Arco I said okay give me Saudi Arco you can't trade that and then I was like fine I'll take China Petro can't trade that one you can't trade them because they're St St P companies ohon you get Monsanto I didn't could have grabbed Monsanto yeah you can grab it for your personal funds if you want I guess no no I hope you guys you should have shorted him I hope you lose everything shorted no I hope you guys lose I'm the most you hope we all lose everything or just me yeah and your little game little game little game you play here's the funny thing if if we all if I said to slime everyone took $10,000 and put on a roulette wheel he'd be fine but we don't get to look at the result for a year he'd be like great that's wonderful do you think there's a difference between what what you guys are doing and playing Blackjack yeah I think Blackjack is worse what I'm doing is eth most you're more likely to lose the play Black yeah that's that's the yeah you're know you're it also goes to the casinos which are evil they're going to send Aiden a picture of the missile he helped build your dollars went towards this this missile b156 8572 missile 562 NATO ammunition well it actually targets children and heat seeks children it can tell by their blood whoa looks like 5 thousand's going up was that whest kids thing the baby seeking bullet baby skull seeking bullet it is atrio Atri Atri did both cuz he put a th into draft kicks oh my God that's dark and I'm not saying any of these companies are good but I was sitting there and I was like it's crazy that you can publicly trade a like a gambling company Yeah man they they skirted a huge loophole gambling was so hard to do online for so long and then sports betting and then sports betting just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the whole game up yeah damn my old man missed out they said what if this was easy here's how much it would make and then someone went wow holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it is a lot and will you get 5% they're like obviously dude I wonder what the numbers will be when it's updated in terms of how much money the average American spends in gambling cuz it's going to go up oh yeah Australia was number one by far they're per capita degenerates but I think I think we're going to close in why is why is Australia they have not have regulations and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they have very lack gambling laws they have a really really strong Casino Lobby in their government like the casinos in Australia have an immense amount of political power and they also are like open later with alcohol than bars that's crazy and then every bar just has a slot in it and the Greyhounds and the the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they call them the the the pinkos the the the touchies they have they have Chad they have Chad in a room just up and all his blood's being siphoned and turned into money he's on a hamster wheel just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] playing Blackjack you can't gamble with that guy I was just talking about this he'll like he'll put his money on the table cuz you don't have any of his plastic money he'll be like all right that's your bet and this one's mine and then he loses and he's like all right you can pay me here yeah I'm like man I don't know if that was my money or not no it's it's like it I get it for theide me and that guy got the same DNA I've been so sober so clean yeah off gambling I I actually want to go I haven't gambled since twitchcon I've been 18 months clean 18 months that's that's two babies in the oven that's that's that's one for every Naked Cowboy hey man mhm I'm trolling to make it too dude we should have done Ram Ranch in the in the charity streamed I if I saw it we would have played it it's a rock song yeah you know there's I think there's actually only guitar I don't think there's any other instruments dude you're right I think that's the only way he can make that many songs is that there's just one instrument yeah and whatever royaltyfree slop he's in jail now so what was your favorite song of the night to perform oh the the Ender Bohemian raps there was so much heart in it probably which is a cheap answer I got so much better at Rock Band as it went on I got way better I could sing and play you didn't I dude you're bad at was until we started drinking no he got better yeah I absolutely did dude he was 98% in medium songs yeah singing no on bass no on base and then we started drinking and then it went and then it took a dive yeah you're like a can't forward tilted this game okay I I need to correct something that was totally wrong that I said singing is the hardest instrument in Rock Band easily I thought it was the easiest for some of us I think it's sorry to be clear you're the greatest performance but your score wasn't good excuse me your score wasn't good my score was awesome it was okay I had 90s I think the Difference Maker is just uh oh but the Stars weren't there so I guess I'm a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] there you go now he gets it I guess maybe I don't know about the stars but your your percent in that song was pretty good and I feel like everything just came down to whether or not you knew the song cuz isn't isn't like KN is go you can go into knowing the song or not knowing the song on guitar on bass on drumes it doesn't matter you just play the notes on the screen but if you don't know the song to sing it it's so much harder I liked the I lik the song where Aiden was so drunk he was singing the lyrics from the song before in the song now oh yeah he was talking about the what was that pilot smelling the dogs dog smell like a dog The woman there are some crazy songs in there and a lot of them about the Chinese the Chinese there was a weird amount of songs about the Chinese dude old rock is like that was Foreigner right what what did you say you said Oriental girl I think it's about China Grove something about an oriental something L you can't say that you know there's still sour with that in it I was just singing the song that was Art if Lil Wayne said Oriental would you say it if gold digger was on there dude dude old rock is about like how mysterious the Chinese are and how all girls are 17 and she was just 17 you kept saying that and it wasn't in the songs but you did keep saying she was just 17 it was in one of the songs one of the songs it was there but then there's like there's just a lot of old rock that does that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you're like you guys are gross yeah then they you they grow up and you find out they're creepy you grow up and you find out they're still doing that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dude there's so many [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] except for David Bowie but songs in that like that like Nice Shot man whatever he man nice shot that song is so many songs R Us but but the hits hits were you guys intrigued At All by which challenges on the wheel were actually like actually the worst versus what you thought were going to be really bad I mean Frozen fies was the worst Frozen fies was terrible I couldn't handle it paintball was the worst no I would have got hit by pain wasn't I wonder why squid oh wait what are you saying he's saying that the squid costume protected you so much that you didn't feel the real pain of a look your wels were worse than everyone's the evidence is there one one of them hit him pretty [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hard that's not true I got shot four times have it I have it still up higher oh yeah you do you do you do I want to see the other one they look like cigar Burns oh my God you pretty fast I still got it the paint the thing with paintball you got smooth back right now I bet it hurt a lot it hurt a lot and

do that again in my life I forgot the hot sauce is there I donated get hot sauce you done it before seven times in my life all donate a thousand I did not you technically did oh I tanked your thousand for what oh cuz it was a third pain another paintball so I guess I technically didn't but dude the hot sauce it was like I've never done that before and I was like how bad could it be it bead it's really bad did you take a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] uh I haven't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yet oh my God you might be good then he was just it made my tummy hurt so bad it hurts in three stages going in the mouth six times it was funny how many times you hit S I was like I was just hurt it was like sandpaper in there okay I think we had equal sour alcohol I don't know if it was cuz I was drinking but I have a psycho confession psycho Aiden confession I kind of like liked the sour candies how many you have I had two or three what color I think I had two or three as well Blues no Blues are good they don't know that souring there's a moment when you're sucking the sour when the Sour's gone and then the inside has like a syrup that's very sweet that's only the blue ones yeah that one's good that's why I like I like tongueing out the sweet stuff it's got It's got fizziness in there but the yellow ones and the other unmarked box that it came in are just so sour and so gross did you even did you do Frozen fies that one was terrible she was like chilling with it I did it with I was afraid my fingers were not going you have terrible circulation that's not I think your hands are already cold don't

around the party going I'm Emerald one and someone would be like nice he's like I'm it's two I'm sorry he is two he is two he hit Emerald one and dropped he's just like I lied I lied I'm sorry lying yeah now I think about it he was drunk at his birthday party dude he stepped up to the table at Rage Cage back toback games there's probably 30 cups on the table and Shake dranks It drinks I think maybe 20 in each game Shake's put in the cage for about 30 minutes straight dude miles was talking to me while playing Rage Cage he's talk he's turning around I'm not at the table he's turning around he's talking to me and every time it gets to him it's a huge stack every time it gets to him he turns around one bounces it in and just goes back to talking to me it was very awesome and then eventually like the cards fall I don't really know how that game works and Miles loses and I'm like that this game is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he's the goat and somehow he lost yeah it is end of Rage Cage is RNG the structure of the game is poor but also usually because rage cages played earlier in the night people want to lose in that spot yeah CU you just get the beer yeah free beer yeah it's not gross it's not like a mixed cup of gross stuff like King's Cup yeah which king cup always [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] blue bro it's just this like Unholy poison people are evil in that game CU you are supposed to pour some of your drink but like they'll be mean about it well depends they can pour some gross [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in it I think maybe you played with mean people who are you playing with Ben Tolson that makes sense Ben messaged me he's like uh he's he's like my wife told me that or said that if he really tried he could be a great singer and I think it was the I it made me feel the best out of anything that came out of the fck the rockathon and I'm like I don't believe that but uh it is very nice I think I don't sing very well but I just sang better than everyone else once and everyone was

that's the problem like you could do a perfect Mar Hoppus into the mic yeah I'm not getting a high score but this dream is going to be entertained yeah yeah that is the issue with rock band is it
