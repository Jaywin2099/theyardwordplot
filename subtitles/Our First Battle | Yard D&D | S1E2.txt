 We need to talk. Say hello to your daughter. &gt;&gt; It's already born &gt;&gt; for day. We're going to have visiting dignitaries. &gt;&gt; I think your penis is a regular sign. &gt;&gt; I'm going to present the four of you. &gt;&gt; Everyone's going to go home. &gt;&gt; Who is trying to kill me? &gt;&gt; My name is uh Princess Selenia. Oh, did we neglect to mention that this is going to be an escort mission? &gt;&gt; She's an escort. &gt;&gt; This is an even better day than I hoped for. And then you hear an explosion start going off. Hello and welcome to the yard DND episode two. Explosions begin rocking the nexus. You hear screams and shouting and people running as the very ground underneath your feet begins to rumble. Um, all of you give me perception checks. Perception checks. &gt;&gt; Yes, chef. &gt;&gt; To make sense of the things that are happening around you right now as well. &gt;&gt; I'm so perceptive. 12 &gt;&gt; 19 &gt;&gt; 11 &gt;&gt; 11 You all hear again it screams in chaos and you kind of unintentionally duck down Gorg. You see again the crowd is gathered forging day and you all were behind the stage here as all of this is starting to go down. As you peek your head around in the crowd, you see two individuals throw their hood back and pull out pistols, flint lock pistols, and start shooting indiscriminately into the crowd. And behind them there is a third person still has their hood up. Wait, we got practical effects here on the show. Oh, wait, wait. Standing behind them like this. And with that, all of you roll initiative. Oh, &gt;&gt; while they're doing this, initiative is how we figure out who's going to go first. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I do want to go early. &gt;&gt; You know, you're not going last. You're going first in the second round. That's &gt;&gt; a Amen. &gt;&gt; 11. &gt;&gt; Amen. I got four. &gt;&gt; 15. &gt;&gt; Leonas 15. Gorg &gt;&gt; 11. &gt;&gt; 11. And Ron &gt;&gt; also 11. &gt;&gt; Also 11. Let's see when our bad guys are going to go. &gt;&gt; Probably a three. &gt;&gt; A strong three. We don't know if there's enemies, by the way. My perception I thought it might have been fireworks. I asked for none. &gt;&gt; You did ask for no like expressly like it was in your writer. &gt;&gt; You're so perceptive. Stone beard. &gt;&gt; Uh Gorg. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You having witnessed that now talking is a free action. Leonus is going to act first. But you see this. You see these people doing this. What does Gorg say? &gt;&gt; Leonus, I have holes in my head that that aren't necessarily ears, but they're holes. Okay. And I know there's some crazy stuff going on. You saw you can see Eric Harris and Dylan Claybold over there. But there's a third one. And he is has a hood. Leonus, I want you to be careful. &gt;&gt; The deep cut. &gt;&gt; Calm down. I don't understand his references, but I think fireworks might be going off somewhere. &gt;&gt; So Brad, they're not fireworks. I swear to Horizon. &gt;&gt; I heard it. &gt;&gt; You really think you're not going to trust me? &gt;&gt; Oh, you think the war guy doesn't know what a gun sounds like? &gt;&gt; Leonus, what would you like to do? I turn and I look at the princess. Ignore them. Stand behind us. We're going to go out and handle this. &gt;&gt; She's like, "Did Did you see those people? They're they're hurting people." &gt;&gt; Just stay backstage. Stay backstage. &gt;&gt; Are you laughing, bro? &gt;&gt; Why are you laughing at the princess? &gt;&gt; I'm thinking about what Gork said. And &gt;&gt; your untimely comedic comment, Gork, &gt;&gt; All right. I shoot I shoot uh my dragon wing long bow at the man in the hood. &gt;&gt; You can go ahead and roll for it here as you pull the bow out and it crackles with electricity as you pull back the string. You don't even need an arrow. Just electricity forms is uh you fire a bolt outwards. &gt;&gt; I roll a two. So I have a 12 &gt;&gt; dungeon master &gt;&gt; on my first on my first attack. Your first arrow goes h hurtling towards this person and you literally see they hold their hand up and swat it away &gt;&gt; without looking up. &gt;&gt; A baby arrow. &gt;&gt; Did you shoot a baby arrow? &gt;&gt; You should have used your adult arrows. Man, &gt;&gt; Leonus is feeling a little sweat on his forehead after that first shot cuz it's it's been again I haven't been getting a lot of sleep and it's and it's it's getting to my head. &gt;&gt; It's okay. Fire another round. I can take another shot. &gt;&gt; You absolutely can. &gt;&gt; I rev up. Pull it back. Electricity crackles through my bow. &gt;&gt; You hear thimble in your voice. He's like, "Okay, little F, little F. All right, pull it back. Tinch your core. Tense it up. All right, here we go." &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. You've been doing this for a while, but you just did this really bad job a second ago. &gt;&gt; Tiny, but I hit what I was aiming at. Okay. &gt;&gt; Uh, nine this time. So, 19. &gt;&gt; As you see, the arrow flies towards them. This time a field of electricity or of energy just crackles in front of them, just bounces off. And you see the head start to raise and you still can't make out the features, but a pair of bright blue eyes are start glowing under the hood. And you see the other two, the ones actively doing the shooting, turn and look and they pull their heads back. One of them looks like a purplish red human, but they have a pair of curling horns and sharp pointed teeth, which you all would have recognized as a teling, a person who has a demon somewhere in their ancestry. It's like a it's like the mutant Xgene manifests sometimes and you're just born as a teling. The other person looks like a man who is sort of pale with like very slightly uh sunken eyes and a dark circle and also has a smaller pair of fangs but otherwise looks like a human. Um but as all of this is happening uh between Gorg and Ran, who has the higher dexterity? &gt;&gt; My dexterity is crazy honestly. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you're a very fast 450 lb. If it's got to be if I'm being real, &gt;&gt; probably you. &gt;&gt; You'd hope it's wrong. &gt;&gt; It's on ability. &gt;&gt; 16 plus three at the top. &gt;&gt; Well, good news. &gt;&gt; Crazy. You're faster than me. &gt;&gt; It's not crazy. &gt;&gt; It's crazy. &gt;&gt; I got good news and I got bad news. The good news is you're going to go before Gorg. The bad news is you're going to go after the shooters. So, Leonus, you see the Tling turns and looks at you and holds her pistol up and she just says, "Revolution now." and shoots at you. What is your armor class, Leonus? &gt;&gt; 17. &gt;&gt; My armor class is 17. Yeah, &gt;&gt; she is going to hit you with her first shot. Um, which does nine piercing damage, &gt;&gt; dude. And give me a constitution save, Leonus. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Leon hurt. &gt;&gt; Might be more. &gt;&gt; Leoness, it doesn't We don't know if it hurt yet. Leon &gt;&gt; Leon, how are you? It's an eight. &gt;&gt; You all see as this like bolt hits him in his shoulder, his blue seal flesh is exposed for a moment and you see black cobwebs start moving through your skin as you have been poisoned &gt;&gt; for another nine points of damage. &gt;&gt; Just &gt;&gt; another. That's extra, dude. &gt;&gt; Yes, that is extra. The other one uh turns and points their pistol at you, Gorg. And but &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; Right off of right off of your chest. Just and looks down at the gun. Perfect. &gt;&gt; Made Horizon strong. &gt;&gt; Ran, this is all happening right in front of you because you guys haven't broken up yet. Leonus has taken this hit right next to you. Gorg has had a bullet bounce off. You are actively taking fire. What would you like to Okay, I'm going to take I'm going to take a shot at uh of Guiding Bolt at the uh the one with the blue eyes. &gt;&gt; Perfect. Saw. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. Make your attack roll. &gt;&gt; Dude, I roll like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] constantly. Nine. &gt;&gt; What does your guiding bolt look like as it goes off, by the way, as you fire this beam? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, it's uh I pull out the back and it's a big arrow of sort of like translucent like white light almost like a like like that John from Smash Ultimate. I can't remember. almost like &gt;&gt; and confused at what their cause is. I I say, "No one throws tomato soup on the Mona Lisa." &gt;&gt; And then I take a shot &gt;&gt; and it crackles towards this person and you see they just tilt their head to the side slightly as the beam like flies past and like smashes into the ground behind is now chaos is starting to erupt. You're seeing people are running, scattering. Other guards are starting to come into the nexus. You see Sanca turns and looks at all of you cuz he was standing there with you and he says, "Protect the princess. Neutralize these foes. I have to lock down the nexus." And he vanishes. &gt;&gt; How convenient. I always go somewhere. &gt;&gt; How convenient. That's saying this is feel like this happens. &gt;&gt; She's like, "This happens a lot." Like what? &gt;&gt; It happens a lot. Princess Selenia is like I just I knew I wanted some excitement but I Oh, okay. All right. I'm just going to the You got shot. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Isn't it gross, princess? &gt;&gt; He's going to be all right. &gt;&gt; But York, it is your turn. &gt;&gt; All right. All right, everyone. Just chill out. So, uh I I identify there's there's two of the guys and there's one in the back and he's evil, but one of them has small fangs, you said. So to be to be clear, there is a hooded person who's yet to reveal themselves. It's just glowing eyes. Uh there is a female Teling uh that is the one that shot Leonus. Uh and there is this other actually ran. Give me either perception or nature, whichever is higher. And give it advantage, which means you're going to roll twice and take the higher. &gt;&gt; You roll like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; I roll crazy bad. It's insane. Uh, higher was 15. I mean, &gt;&gt; it's Ran, are you high right now? &gt;&gt; Canonically, you are high right now. High right now. &gt;&gt; All right. Hello. &gt;&gt; The dice are helping you tell the story. &gt;&gt; Uh, yeah. 15. &gt;&gt; With a 15, you you think you know something about the man with the fangs. Uh, but you probably got to get a little closer to him. You know, like there's something about that guy. &gt;&gt; How close am I right now? Uh, I'd say you guys are about 60 feet away right now because they are out in the crowd with all of this happening and you guys Yes. And you guys are behind the stage. However, Gorg, again, it is your turn. &gt;&gt; Can I roll an athletics check to uh do a cool spin move before I attack to impress the princess? &gt;&gt; Uh, you can give me either athletics or performance. Yes. To see how cool you can do this. &gt;&gt; Well, it life is but a performance. So, &gt;&gt; whichever is going to be higher. Why don't we throw this guy like a Koopa at the &gt;&gt; Hey. All right, everyone stand back. I'm rolling. I roll an uh 11. &gt;&gt; So, uh 11 is literally just above average. So, you tell me what Gorg does. Like, you do it, but it's kind of &gt;&gt; So, I take out I take out my like my my What is my weapon? &gt;&gt; Your vicious trident. I take out my vicious trident and it's got little turtles on it and I'm like spinning it, but I'm like kind of doing it slow and bad. And then I do a spin move uh about four and a half spins. Uh but on the fourth one I get really sick for a second. Um also the smell of Leonus's wound is really gross. &gt;&gt; It's disgusting. &gt;&gt; He's poisoned and he's like drying and it's infected and so I like almost &gt;&gt; so I spin around. I almost throw up &gt;&gt; and then I look at the princess and I wink. &gt;&gt; She goes all in front of your daughter just &gt;&gt; uh for the record your wicked trident like all of you have these like elaborate weapons, this crackling bow, you know, this huge axe, uh these cool shorts swords. Um actually long swords I believe you've got. &gt;&gt; They're very long. &gt;&gt; Very Yeah, very very long for changeling. Yeah, absolutely. The vicious trident, however, looks like nasty and barbed and rusted. It just like you would not want to prick your finger on this thing that he carries around with. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's it's part of it. &gt;&gt; Oh, bro. Dude, I hate when you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pull that thing out, &gt;&gt; but it's vicious. &gt;&gt; It smells like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; I could stab you and smite you and pump you twice and you're done. &gt;&gt; You pump You shouldn't pump that dragon twice. &gt;&gt; She's right. You say that, &gt;&gt; Ran. When you say that, you see GJ's head kind of pops out and you feel this wave of emotion from her like &gt;&gt; just disgust from this young dragon. &gt;&gt; I thought this was sativa. Sorry. &gt;&gt; That's what I thought. &gt;&gt; I'll ch I'll chill on you, &gt;&gt; Gorg. I'm going to give you that. I'm not going to take your action for that. So, uh what would you like to do? &gt;&gt; So, I'd like to I I want to target the uh the smaller fanged um uh enemy &gt;&gt; and because I say take this baby dick. because they have smaller fangs than normal. And &gt;&gt; so you're not saying take this baby dick. You're saying take this baby dick. &gt;&gt; Embarrassing if you still had &gt;&gt; It would be embarrassing for me to say that, which I don't. &gt;&gt; All turtles had them. Then it'd be fine. &gt;&gt; No, turtles are &gt;&gt; Do you have a baby tag? &gt;&gt; Apparently it's like a cobra. I believe we were &gt;&gt; Yeah, they they've seen that. You smell disgusting, so I don't want to hear it from you. &gt;&gt; I I heard what you heard. &gt;&gt; Uh I roll for I'm sorry. What is it? &gt;&gt; Oh, what is it that you would like to do? &gt;&gt; Uh just an attack with my vicious trident. &gt;&gt; So, you're going to have to move towards them. Uh I didn't say you can move 30 ft. I didn't say they're walking towards you, but I'm going to say they're kind of like just walking forward blasting at this point. So, you could get to them &gt;&gt; with their blunder muscles. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I start pistols. I got a little bit of throw up on my mouth and I'm &gt;&gt; h I roll a a a nine. &gt;&gt; You swing right at this man and it's just like again you normally you meet sort of force with force. He does anything but. He just like rotates and when he rotates he brings the gun up like he's going to put it under your chin just like looking you straight in the eye. But you do have a second attack. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So I try again. And that's 22. &gt;&gt; Uh, more than enough. So, you tell me how you hit this guy. You're not going to kill him with just this one hit. But, &gt;&gt; so he puts his gun under my chin and I say, "Yeah, that's you thought." And &gt;&gt; are you okay? &gt;&gt; And I like because I can't think of something fast enough because I'm genuinely afraid he's going to blow my head off. I just decide uh to attack it and I kind of like slide it. I do a sweep and I sweep under it. &gt;&gt; Well, are you going to smite it? &gt;&gt; I'm going to smite. &gt;&gt; Uh, again, I remind you, you can do just a level one smite, which is just sort of like a tap, or you can use a higher level spell slot if you like. &gt;&gt; This is the level one smite. I'm saving my big pumps, &gt;&gt; my level two pumps &gt;&gt; for the strongest enemies. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And uh I I want to announce that to the team and also the enemies. &gt;&gt; You think it's dire enough right now to use your your &gt;&gt; Leonus? I know this guy might be scary to you, but this is not like a two pump. &gt;&gt; I'm poisoned. &gt;&gt; That's a good idea. Save your palms. &gt;&gt; Is you are attacking this guy and you guys are bantering. He look He's like, I'm I'm sorry. Am I Am I Am I not holding your your attention currently? &gt;&gt; No, you're fine. Uh but yes, I &gt;&gt; So, you're going to roll your damage there again. Uh in DND Beyond, which we're using, there's not a way to add the smite. So, two of these D8s, these like diamond ones. Roll those for me. Just give it to me when you got it. Nine. &gt;&gt; Nine plus your weapon damage you roll just for the vicious trident there. &gt;&gt; Five. &gt;&gt; Five. Perfect. It is like is that all you And then the explosion goes off. Uh you tell me what does it look like when your holy energy radiates through your divine smite. &gt;&gt; So because I went for a sweep move because he already kind of had me on the ropes there. Uh it it I I do a sweep and it's kind of like in anime or media scrolls where uh they it's like for a minute it didn't nothing really happened. There's like a little latency and then light just comes up from the ground where I swept it and it burns him. &gt;&gt; This is just for Dawn from Elen Ring. &gt;&gt; It's kind of &gt;&gt; It's very much like but as he flies up I see a tiny little bulge in his pants and I I'm like I realized that he was right. My perception check that he had a baby dick was correct. &gt;&gt; Out in the crowd is all of this is going down now. Uh you see this hooded person pushes the hood back and stands up for a moment and what was once a living elf. She looks very similar to the arch druids you saw that I said they look almost like super elves, &gt;&gt; but she's very clearly dead. purplish white skin, sunken cheeks, sunken eyes, but that intense blue glow. And she just kind of like calmly looks around, even though literally all hell's breaking loose around her, and she says, "This whole thing is a sham. Your forging is a sham. Your terror den are a lie. And we who stand at the crossroads will tell the truth." and she holds her hand up and in front of her you all see a storm cloud begin to form right in front of her with like wind and electricity and lightning going through it and it just starts crackling and sending electricity in random directions actively attacking the crowd and she turns and looks right at you Stone Beard and she says huh hero let's see if you can actually surely do something right for once and just holds her hands out as this thing is happening here. And it is your turn, Stone Beard. &gt;&gt; I I just want to say, have you guys ever noticed that it's always Ron's guys that are &gt;&gt; It's weird. &gt;&gt; It's always Ron. &gt;&gt; It's weird. &gt;&gt; Leonus Halt, focus. &gt;&gt; Oh, Mr. I have plenty of undead friends over here. &gt;&gt; Technommancer. Technommancer Zyra, who is like still on the stage kind of covering her head, is like that is a harmful misconception. &gt;&gt; I know. I know. This [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is crazy. Why don't we just dip? &gt;&gt; All right, Leonus and Rome, I'm going to leave my my Eldrich Cannon. And I'd like to summon I summon my Eldrich Cannon Protector &gt;&gt; right next to them two. What does it look like when you're it? &gt;&gt; It it it comes out and my it's like normally my cannon, but when the protector mode uh happens uh like a shield icon pops out the top, but uh outside of the cannon, which is like a beautiful bronze rusted, you know. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Battle torn cannon. The shield is a bright pink. &gt;&gt; Perfect. &gt;&gt; Uh and just kind of has a glowing hue. &gt;&gt; Perfect. &gt;&gt; Listen up. If you stay within 10 ft of this cannon, it will heal you at all times. I'm going to enter with Gorg and we'll fight close up, but keep your longrange attacks going. And then you said they're within 30 ft at this point, I imagine. &gt;&gt; Uh, if you move, they will be. &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. So, I'm going to I'm going to run straight up to them. I will use my bonus action to activate rage and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bust out of my shirt, my my pink frill shirt, if you remember that I had all the &gt;&gt; forget the pink shirt. Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; And I And I turn back I turn back to San Kofa. apologies about the shirt. And then I go for one beautiful attack with my great ax of warning and I lift it up. It's It's just And it's a one hand, too. I put it all the way back like Odell Beckham Jr. &gt;&gt; And then and then I'm going directly for the woman who called me out, the the elf that dead elf lady. And I'm dropping it right on her skull. And I roll a massive 11 &gt;&gt; as the X comes. &gt;&gt; Excuse me. &gt;&gt; That was damage. That was the wrong thing. Roll the roll the attack. &gt;&gt; I pull it all the way back one hand and then I drop it on and I roll a 19. &gt;&gt; Oh, you bring the axe down and she looks at you and she reaches up and catches it bare-handed. And when she does, you see it bites into her hand and it starts to like bleed a little bit and she just looks at it and she goes, "Okay." And I keep it down and I'm holding it there &gt;&gt; and then I go, "Yeah, okay." Too &gt;&gt; damn 19. And she catches that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's kind of rough. &gt;&gt; But this brings us back around to the top with you, Leonus. Uh, what specifically does your um your shield do? Yes, I waited till the exact second you put food in your mouth to to ask you this question here, Stone Beard. &gt;&gt; What my shield do? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Uh, heals. &gt;&gt; Yeah. How much? Because it might be very relevant to him, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I'm I'm down a lot. &gt;&gt; Well, the good news for you is you have my Eldrich Cannon, which I gave to you very kindly. Uh, emits a burst of positive energy that grants itself and each creature of your choice within 10 ft of it a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 plus your intelligence modifier. &gt;&gt; So, it's 1d8 plus three. &gt;&gt; I rolled an eight. So, &gt;&gt; 11 11 temporary hit points. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you're not there. It was over by the &gt;&gt; Okay, that's what I thought. But the back &gt;&gt; I just wanted to roll in. But my question is why are you two as men hanging out near that shield? &gt;&gt; Cuz I'm poisoned. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Um, but it is actually your turn. Yes, &gt;&gt; Ron. I'm a little worried. I'm a little worried that this this your friend &gt;&gt; don't call don't call her my friend. I don't know. I don't &gt;&gt; I don't know her. &gt;&gt; Is impervious to my attacks. &gt;&gt; And said like what are you know every fish? &gt;&gt; Focus on the back. You know every bisexual in the village &gt;&gt; on the battle. &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah. Well, I have I have 11 hit points. I know that as a character somehow. &gt;&gt; Pimple on your shoulders. Like I mean I know every bisexual in the &gt;&gt; I'm not pimple with a pimple. That's &gt;&gt; actually hang on. Ran, do give me a perception check. &gt;&gt; I'm just still holding my axe. I'm like, what are you doing? &gt;&gt; We're busy. Hold on. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And blood's just running down her arm. &gt;&gt; Perception check 15. A lot's happening with explosions and guns, but you swear you almost hear like somebody whispering before uh Leonus is kind of like not now. Like it's it's hard to place though cuz it isn't a small voice. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] was that? &gt;&gt; Again, focus on this. I am going to I think we need to flank the remaining enemy. It seems like we can't damage the uh hooded figure for now. She has some sort of electrical field that I'm worried is blocking my bow attacks and not to do with my aim. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. Classic Leonus wants to hit it from behind. All right. Let's get in there. &gt;&gt; I will misty step. &gt;&gt; Oh, all right. &gt;&gt; Uh to the other side cuz I believe it's sort of like a stadium or a staging area. So, I'm going to misty step into the stands behind where these people are. &gt;&gt; Perfect. Uh when I miss step there is sort of a a bubble of water at my feet and then a mist or like a sea spraying that comes up and I disappear. A little bit of the salty water it disperses into the air. Some of it gets &gt;&gt; gets on Gorg shell shell gets in his mouth. &gt;&gt; I like when he does it. &gt;&gt; It's a few Bonnie We don't have a lot of Bonnie moments being &gt;&gt; this is one of them. Yeah. And I teleport into the stands and I decide to use my long bow against the remaining human figure. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he looks he looks kind of human. &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; actually, you know what? I'm going to let all of you give me nature checks. &gt;&gt; Nature time &gt;&gt; again. You can do this with advantage. Um &gt;&gt; 19 &gt;&gt; R 19 &gt;&gt; 17. I'm so full of nature. &gt;&gt; Very nature, miss. &gt;&gt; I eat berries. &gt;&gt; I got 13. &gt;&gt; 13. Perfect. You should You're supposed to be pretty good at nature, but &gt;&gt; I know seven &gt;&gt; Gorg. It kind of makes sense that Gorg and Stone Beard realize this, especially as you as you've gotten closer to them, right? This man is a dumpier. He is still alive. &gt;&gt; Bottle of champagne, &gt;&gt; but that's an expensive bottle of champagne, right? But just like the woman has a demon ancestor, this man has a vampireic ancestor. A vampire may have been a parent, may have been a grandparent, some somewhere in his line, there was a vampire and it comes out. So, he's got undead traits, but is not actually undead. &gt;&gt; I I think I think this man's been sucked. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; The man's been sucked. Don't you feel &gt;&gt; sucked? I think I get I think I get what he means. &gt;&gt; I think I think he has vampiric ancestors. Wait, are you sure? I'm pretty sure &gt;&gt; this is the best team. Sorry, but yeah, while she's actively sassing them. Yes, please. &gt;&gt; I I I rev up the longbow again. Another little crackle. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; A bit of thunder and uh I give it a shot at the at the dump here. &gt;&gt; I believe in you. &gt;&gt; Uh oh, that's not bad. Uh 10 battle. Dirty 20. Dirty 20. Uh, that is enough. That is enough to hit him. &gt;&gt; Excellent. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; 10 damage. &gt;&gt; 10 damage. Excellent. Give me your second attack. &gt;&gt; And 17. &gt;&gt; Uh, 17 is 17 total. &gt;&gt; 17 total. &gt;&gt; That is actually not enough. The first arrow hits him in the back and then the second arrow he just like turns and he's like, "Oh, we're doing this. Okay, let's do it." &gt;&gt; Does he get advantage if he shot from behind? &gt;&gt; He does not. Not specifically. Holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; But that is a that is a hit and a miss. Um &gt;&gt; nice change of pace. We landed one. &gt;&gt; That's what you say. &gt;&gt; It's been a rough few weeks. &gt;&gt; That looked like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] man. &gt;&gt; I hit him. &gt;&gt; I hit him. You missed last time. &gt;&gt; I'm still going to chill at the &gt;&gt; You also missed last time. &gt;&gt; The dumpier has now taken a few hits. Um the tling has not taken any. True to his word, the dumpier turns and returns fire with his gun. Uh, what is your AC? &gt;&gt; My 17. &gt;&gt; Uh, this time he is going to miss wildly as he's like trying to shoot, but Gorg sort of all over him and like boom, just shoots wide. Uh, the Tling is going to try. Actually, the Tling turns and points her pistol right at you. Point blank, Stone Beard. But when she goes to shoot, you see this woman that's holding the axe, motions with her hand, and you see the pistol moves wide and misses. Like, and she just looks at you and she says, "You haven't figured it out yet, have you? Do we hook up before? Just you're &gt;&gt; you're celibate. I'm not celibate. You guys started this." &gt;&gt; You told them you were celibate. &gt;&gt; I'm not c No, I didn't say I don't heavily implied heavily implied as celibacy. However, that brings us back around to you, Ran. Uh, as both enemies have missed with their attacks. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, can you remind me what the cannon does for my &gt;&gt; It gave you the temporary hit points and that's just it. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, I have the I have the plus 11. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, I should go for an attack for sure. &gt;&gt; Uh, would would you make sure that they don't have to stay close to it? I I don't remember with that ability off hand. &gt;&gt; When you create the cannon, you determine it appearance. It has legs. &gt;&gt; Oh, you can direct the cannon to walk or climb up to 15 feet &gt;&gt; by itself, maybe. I I can't tell. I can't tell based off the reading. My gut says you got to be within 10. &gt;&gt; I will I will double check it, but in the meantime, do what we can. &gt;&gt; Can just think he has to be near it. And just push it into the combat. Like, hey, hold on, guys. Oh, I'm coming in. One sec. I'm It's making like a big like I'm moving a boulder sound. &gt;&gt; Perfect. &gt;&gt; Uh I'm like, "All right, I'm here." And then I want to take a guiding bolt at the teeth. &gt;&gt; All right, go ahead and roll your attack. &gt;&gt; 20 16 plus four. &gt;&gt; Uh dirty 20. That is enough to hit her. I have the I have the the cannon and am I near Gorg? &gt;&gt; You could be. Let me just say for again for for for people that are trying to figure out the terminologies. Dirty 20 is when it totals up to 20. Natural 20 is when it's a 20 on the die and that's a crit. Uh yes, you could get close enough to Gorg. &gt;&gt; Okay, so uh after after seeing Leonus fail an arrow, uh I I run and jump off the back of Gueorg and I fly into the air. I look over at Leonus and I say, "Watch this pussy." And I fire the arrow. &gt;&gt; Oh, have at it. So damage is 16 + 11, right? &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Uh the 11 is your temporary hit points. Um but if you did 16, it's 16. &gt;&gt; But I don't have the Oh, &gt;&gt; bro. That's hit points, bro. &gt;&gt; On top of on top of &gt;&gt; ironing, buddy. Okay. I'm over 28. Okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a it's a separate pool. You you'll go through those first. &gt;&gt; So 16. &gt;&gt; Perfect. Um, a guiding bolt has another benefit that when you hit them, you make it easier for the next person to hit them. Uh, because they start glowing. So, as you hit her, she lights up. The next person that attacks the teling will have advantage. Perfect. Anything else from you, Ron? &gt;&gt; I guess I could use bark inspiration. &gt;&gt; You could. Yep. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um, who's next? Who's &gt;&gt; uh Gorg is next? &gt;&gt; Inspire me, Ron. &gt;&gt; I guess I'm close to everyone. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; but me though. So, Gork, you have an extra d6 that uh you only you can only use it once, but you use it when you want &gt;&gt; on an attack or a saving throw or a skill check. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So, Gorg, it's your turn. &gt;&gt; Who has been targeted so far? Who &gt;&gt; kind of everybody is at least the only person who's actually been seriously damaged so far is Leonus, but I mean, &gt;&gt; I don't think they've attacked me yet, have they? &gt;&gt; Uh, no. Actually, no. You haven't been shot at yet, which we shall have to rectify. &gt;&gt; You know, you know what I'm about. Well, I'm still I'm still locked in combat with who I have determined to be baby dick um of the pterodin. &gt;&gt; It's a harmful stereotype, I guess. &gt;&gt; And uh and I'm trying to finish the job. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; So, uh it's just it's another vicious trident summer. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And we're going to we're going to roll for that. &gt;&gt; So, let's do it like this. First, just give me the attacks and then you give me all the damage afterwards. H I roll a one plus six. &gt;&gt; So again on a one you definitely fail. Something definitely bad happens. You you tell me what happens uh when you're trying to hit this here. &gt;&gt; So I'm like guess what? It's vicious trident summer baby dick using the bic inspiration from ran that means so much. I also want to impress Stone Beard. He's an he's he chose me to lead the charge because I'm weigh 450 lbs. This means a lot to me. I take out my trident. I do a cool spin move. It actually looks kind of cool. Princess, I wink at her. She's not looking because she's scared. And I thrust it. &gt;&gt; And as far as I get. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's just completely off. Like you very much like Star Wars kid that old video of him doing all the twirls and just wildly miss just stab at nothing and like all three of them stop and like &gt;&gt; But you do however have a second attack. So go go ahead and try. &gt;&gt; It was a good attempt Gorg. &gt;&gt; Thank you guys. Usually the first one doesn't go well. The second one will surely &gt;&gt; I said all that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to you. &gt;&gt; You see she turns and looks at you. The one who still hasn't let go of your axe and is like this is the best and brightest the Terraran have to offer. This is the future of the five kingdoms. &gt;&gt; Stone, tell her sometimes you roll bad. &gt;&gt; I I didn't even need to come here today. But you but you do have a second attack. So just give me the attack. &gt;&gt; 19. &gt;&gt; Uh that is enough. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so even though I miss I I kind of like I I roll with it, right? and I roll with it and I come around and I do another spin move and then I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I like and I actually use my trident and I just whip him on the ass with it with a blunt end. &gt;&gt; Uh just and I assume you still want to smite. &gt;&gt; Oh, we're smiting. just give me the damage when you got it. Because while all of this is happening, she looks at you, uh, Stone Beard, still holding on to your axe, and she just says, "I would kill you with my own bare hands, but I think that would be doing you a favor. So instead, I'm just going to kill everyone else." and she goes and in front of you, you see this noxious poison gas starts rolling out of her mouth while she's maintaining eye contact with you in swarming out in all directions. Uh, I need all of you to give me a con save. &gt;&gt; I literally can't be poisoned. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you absolutely can't. &gt;&gt; I Okay, &gt;&gt; I think I'm worse than you, man. &gt;&gt; 14. I roll a 14. &gt;&gt; I roll a 14. I have rolled &gt;&gt; for a total of two. &gt;&gt; Two. I rolled a three. &gt;&gt; It's I I'm gonna say Leonus. It's like you very much see the poison coming and it's like, "Oh, I need to hold my breath." &gt;&gt; Just take a big Yeah. &gt;&gt; I take a big huff of the poison on accident. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right before you suck it in, I go, "Don't breathe it in. &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, the pain, &gt;&gt; don't breathe this. It might not be that bad though. Um, it's mildly bad. Okay. &gt;&gt; Damn. &gt;&gt; 23 points of poison damage. &gt;&gt; Oh my god, dude. Thank god you had Stone Beard's weird shield. &gt;&gt; Wait, are you dead, &gt;&gt; dude? I'm I I do not have a lot of I'm I'm feeling bad right now. &gt;&gt; You see just like a huge smile comes on her face as it's just like rolling out of me. &gt;&gt; Is everyone around us dropping dead? the like a lot of people are choking and coughing and starting I mean people are trying to clear out but I mean they it is very much just like uh starting to get them. &gt;&gt; So nine plus six &gt;&gt; okay is &gt;&gt; 15 perfect &gt;&gt; I do 15 damage and uh and it really hurts him and he hates it. &gt;&gt; Perfect. It does really hurt him and he does really hate it. &gt;&gt; He said out my balls. You see as this like this cloud of poison rolls out. It rolls over the teling and the dumpier too. And both of them are like &gt;&gt; and you see the black websing over like they're getting hurt too but they're just still they're in it with her while she's doing this. However, um it is your turn, Stone Beard. &gt;&gt; Okay. So I still do. She still hold my axe. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; What causes this? That you kill the lives of the innocent? Perhaps if I met someone innocent, I'd let them go. &gt;&gt; Oh, so the common around you deserve no life. &gt;&gt; Commonborn, look at this place. The nexus is a fortress of the Pterodin. You're all soldiers, and anyone foolish enough to have brought their loved ones into a war zone deserves what they get. You shouldn't die. &gt;&gt; Hey, tell him, Stone Bread. &gt;&gt; All right, then. Then I'm I'm raged out of my mind. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; And it's like it's it's like pulsing now cuz I'm pretty [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mad about this, man. I'm like, "No, I'm actually fuming for real." &gt;&gt; For real. &gt;&gt; You hear is GJ is trying to like move down into your deeper into your shell. &gt;&gt; No, get in there. There's air in the shell &gt;&gt; and you feel fear coming off of her, &gt;&gt; dude. It's okay. &gt;&gt; Yes. Stone Beard, your turn. &gt;&gt; All right. So, I would like to first swing down my great axe of warning &gt;&gt; on main girl. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Uh, I get advantage here. &gt;&gt; Well, if you attack recklessly, uh, you will get advantage, which means it's easier to hit her, but it'll be easier for them to hit you back if they choose to. &gt;&gt; I'm reckless as it gets. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And I roll a 22. &gt;&gt; More than enough. And and so I I go I pull it out of her hand and I go forward jabby style straight for her open mouth where the poison's leaving out of &gt;&gt; and it and jams through her head. Give me the damage. &gt;&gt; So I do 12 damage total. you very and you see like uh her those blue glowing eyes just sort of like narrow a little bit uh as the uh axe jams into her mouth. Perfect. Uh anything else from Stone Beer? &gt;&gt; I would like just to send a message for my bonus action to send Coots onto her head and just start [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] clawing out her hair and it's just frizzing it up, you know? It's just making it look a lot worse. &gt;&gt; Yeah. just trying to look cool while I'm doing this. Yeah. Has his like coots on her head. Leonus, you hear thimble on your shoulder. And he's like, "Hey, hey, buddy. I don't I don't do well with um poison, so I'm going have to get out of here, but I I I just I just need you to know something. Um so I can like read people. I'm really good at it, right? And I'm really good at it when they're undead, right? Some of this is probably obvious. She's super [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] evil. She's so evil, right? But like emotionally, she's so calm right now. She's not mad. She's not scared. She's just like, "This is a day at the office." It's so weird. &gt;&gt; Then you're This is You're terrifying me. Also, you're leaving me. You told me you would leave me. I'm intending to survive. No, maybe you also should maybe be not here so you can live. I I admittedly was thinking along these limits. &gt;&gt; All of you give me perception checks again. Not you, Leonus. &gt;&gt; Juicy 17 21 &gt;&gt; 21 R and Stone Beard. I'm going to give this to you two. Um, you all notice in the fog as the poison is all over the place, you do see the outline of a little person. He's still invisible, but you kind of can make it out on his shoulder. Like literally like pleading with with Leonus like like let's go. &gt;&gt; Bro, you you looking you seeing that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You see that? &gt;&gt; Leonus, we'll have to have a conversation about this later. &gt;&gt; But for now, please attack the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I &gt;&gt; It's a little man. I see a man. &gt;&gt; I can't see anything. &gt;&gt; You can't see it. No. But it is your turn, Leonus. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm Leonus, do the self spray thing again. I like it. I'm feeling a little overwhelmed. Maybe a bit of sensory overload on top of the two batches of poison I've taken, can I can I can I recommend a move like you might you might you might not realize this, right? Okay. So, like there are some advantages here. Just like you want to bring her down, right? Just concentrate on shooting her. Not the bow. Just He's like, "Hold your hold your hands up, man. Hold your hands up." Uh, roll your Eldrich blast for me. &gt;&gt; Like Ricky Bobby. &gt;&gt; Whole uh describe for me is like crackling energy is going to come from Leonus &gt;&gt; and shoot at her. You tell me what it looks like. I have been I'm on on a knee in the stands and I I'm frustr simultaneously frustrated with thimble and and in pain and very fearful of returning what of what I might go back to having already visited twice of having visited the beyond twice and I really really do not want to go back. So I I flex my my my lats a bit and &gt;&gt; okay &gt;&gt; and I I push forward out of my chest a sort of thunder there's a thunder clap or a thunder sound right before I push my hands together and push forward this giant bolt of electricity towards uh towards the woman that is attacking Stone Beard. &gt;&gt; Because you can't roll for this, I'll roll for you. But because I roll like a god, I got a natural 20. &gt;&gt; So, but at least it's for you and not against you, you know. &gt;&gt; You see, &gt;&gt; this is for you, Stard. &gt;&gt; Two of these beams come out of your hands uh shooting at her. Uh so, uh Eldrich Blast does a d10 of damage. Uh because there's two beams and one of them was a crit, you're going to roll three of these. You need another one, too. breasts. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Cuz there's two. &gt;&gt; Oh, 10, &gt;&gt; five, and three. So, 18. &gt;&gt; Excellent. You see these two beams like And you holes get blown out of her like and you can see her rib cage and inside her ribs has that same blue energy and a second one blows off like part of her face. Uh, which is kind of has her skull exposed there. uh with the glowing blue eye uh is you have done quite a bit of damage and you hear a thimble in your ear. He's like, "See, see that's right. Okay, I'm going to go cuz I'm no use to you." D I hate that you're right and I hate that you're leaving me, but thank you [Laughter] &gt;&gt; as as he sort of flies away from you. This might be all I can do for now. And I misty step uh out. There's like these channels where people were running out of like the stadium or like the the staging area before and I misty step further away uh as far as I can to make sure that I'm a little more out of the action. &gt;&gt; Perfect. And on the other side of it, you realize what a nightmarish scene this is. Is this like yellowish poison is creeping along the ground and people are just collapsing and trying to like drag each other out of it. And you see a lot of the other pteroden like rushing in trying to like cover their mouths and get people and some of them are succeeding and some of them are just collapsing as well in the midst of all of this. &gt;&gt; I feel like I need to help some of these people. Uh but I &gt;&gt; that's not why you left. &gt;&gt; I will leave. I noticed that he's gone, but I do really love the salt spray come down. So, I'm doing this, but I'm pissed. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the end of my turn. I'm a little more Yeah, I'm like shadowed out of the way in this uh this exit of the arena. &gt;&gt; Perfect. Um bad guy's turn. The dump here draws his sword. He's got a gun in one hand and the sword in the other is going to attempt to attack you twice. Gorg missing wildly just like clanging off of your shell. And he's like, "What the hell is this tux made out of?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, I know. It's it's it's just paint on my shell. Isn't that funny? &gt;&gt; He's like, "No, that's stupid." &gt;&gt; Well, I look good, so you're still weak. &gt;&gt; And since we've established nobody nobody was paying attention to ran, uh the teling turns and looks at you and she goes, "The hell? What What is your AC, Ran?" &gt;&gt; Oh, 16. &gt;&gt; 16. Uh, she is definitely going to shoot you cuz that is 16 on the die. Uh, give me a con save ran. &gt;&gt; Uh, three &gt;&gt; center mass ran. Uh, into your exposed chest with one of these bullets for nine points of damage. &gt;&gt; Oh. &gt;&gt; And you also take another nine poison damage. &gt;&gt; So, wait, just nine or &gt;&gt; nine and nine? 18 total? &gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is. You see the poison start spreading across. &gt;&gt; Oh, I hate when you get shot, Ron, and I can see your organs. I'm so tired of seeing your organs. &gt;&gt; Oh god, inhaling poison sucks. I don't want to do that. &gt;&gt; You do that every day when you smoke. &gt;&gt; I do what? &gt;&gt; It's true. That's smoking. &gt;&gt; She's like, it's it is true. It's going to take years off your life. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm going to take all the years off. &gt;&gt; Am I close enough? Am I close enough to hear this? &gt;&gt; Are you're 100t away? Don't talk. &gt;&gt; Don't talk close. &gt;&gt; You're not close enough, &gt;&gt; bro. You got to quit smoking, man. &gt;&gt; It's bad for you, &gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Uh, that's the bad guys. That brings us It is your turn, Ran. So, remember that nobody attacked the Teling. She's still glowing. So, the next person that tries to attack her will have advantage. Uh, but it's your turn. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to use a guiding bowl on the Teling. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, this time you roll with advantage. You can roll twice and take the higher. &gt;&gt; First roll 20 24. &gt;&gt; Perfect. More that you roll the damage. &gt;&gt; Damn. That's right. So you double the damage cuz uh &gt;&gt; damn [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So she's like click blam and you're like &gt;&gt; uh 22. &gt;&gt; You She shoots you and you and she looks down and there's just a hole in her chest and she looks back at you and she goes and collapses. &gt;&gt; Oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; you undead guys are so hit. &gt;&gt; I can't I can't really see. I killed her. I killed her. &gt;&gt; I did kill her. It's gross. &gt;&gt; And you see that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] still a pile of &gt;&gt; or blew a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hole in her like 50 cents. You moved up in the tier list. &gt;&gt; Having brought down one of them, you technically still have a bonus action if there's anything else you'd like to do. &gt;&gt; I used the rest of my turn to move uh next to Stone Beard. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Starting to feel like him and I are the only ones we're going to land any hits, &gt;&gt; you know, which brings us right to Gorg. This is this is a great time. you you were engaged with the dump here. Um uh this other undead woman is not far away. &gt;&gt; My uh BIC inspiration had turned from inspiration and now it's just pure spite cuz I don't like the way I'm being I'm being talked to by Ran the gross undead. &gt;&gt; There's organs everywhere. I can see bones. And I &gt;&gt; You spent half the battle drinking my salty spray. &gt;&gt; You're nowhere near us. You're nowhere near us right now. &gt;&gt; I did drink a salty spray. I I do like when he missed these steps. It is so fun. Uh but I I do I I want to switch targets to the uh the person attacking uh or that Stone Beard is locked in combat with. &gt;&gt; And you know what? It's double smite summer. &gt;&gt; Perfect. Uh because she is very much undead, your smite will hit harder against her as well. &gt;&gt; So first, give me your two attacks. &gt;&gt; God, I'm going to do so much [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] damage. It's going to be crazy. &gt;&gt; Oh, don't get overconfident. You got to hit first. All right, first one is a 17. &gt;&gt; Uh, that is not enough. &gt;&gt; Okay. God, &gt;&gt; but you have the BIC inspiration. So, roll a d6 and add that to this. &gt;&gt; Five. &gt;&gt; Okay, that is now enough. &gt;&gt; Ran, what do you say to help him hit? Cuz it's going the wrong way. Like, it's going wide. I say, bro, remember what I said? Be a dick. Your hair looks frumpy because of the cat in in your hair. Your hair looks The cat made your hair frumpy. Terrible. &gt;&gt; That'll work. Give me the other attack first. That is definitely going to hit. But um you're going to roll a bunch of dice here. &gt;&gt; Another 17. &gt;&gt; Uh that one is not going to make it. And you don't have another B inspiration. So, but you're going to get her than once. So, you can give me the damage and you roll three. Well, okay. Actually, let's clarify. First of all, would you like to use a higher level spell slot? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'd like to use higher level smite. &gt;&gt; Perfect. I believe you've only got level two spells. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, that is already going to make it 3d8, right? From a higher level. &gt;&gt; She's undead. That's going to make it 4d8. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So, give me the damage for the vicious trident and then roll 4d8. &gt;&gt; Dude, that's so much. &gt;&gt; That might be a d10, actually. &gt;&gt; And here's my here's my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] damage, dude. &gt;&gt; Go. &gt;&gt; All right. Big numbers. &gt;&gt; 6771. &gt;&gt; 21. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, it's another three or did you include that there? &gt;&gt; No, not with that total. The 24 plus the the four original four &gt;&gt; 28. Perfect. &gt;&gt; Gorg, you come and just smash into her and the light explodes and you guys see like most of her flesh is like blown away and you can see through her rib cage this glowing mist and everything. And she steps back and pulls the axe out of her mouth, Stone Beard, and looks at all of you and she says, "You think you've won? You fools thought you won last time. Elf, watch them die in chain lightning shoots through the three of you. and through all the diplomats up on the stage. Just electricity goes through all of you. Give me dexes. &gt;&gt; The wonder from Nazi zombies. &gt;&gt; While this is happening, you see the electricity burns off the poison as it is just like shooting in all directions. And she just looks at you smiling and just like drops to the ground afterwards. Uh, deck saves. &gt;&gt; I rolled a dirty 20. &gt;&gt; Dirty 20. Three. &gt;&gt; Three. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; Dirty 11. &gt;&gt; It's always dirty, man. &gt;&gt; Good news. Bad news. The bad The good news is, Irone, you're only going to take half the damage. &gt;&gt; Huge. &gt;&gt; The bad news is quite a lot of damage is about to come down range. Um, I need all the D8s here actually. &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; Cuz this is pretty significant. &gt;&gt; I don't have any. &gt;&gt; I got one. &gt;&gt; All right. This might be No, this &gt;&gt; This is crazy, &gt;&gt; dungeon master. This is so many D8s. &gt;&gt; Uh I I I need at least one more. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Dude. &gt;&gt; Dude, there's &gt;&gt; We are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dead. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm feeling a a wave of uh &gt;&gt; Put it on the remorse or regret, some sadness that I left my team behind &gt;&gt; and we can't hear it cuz you're gone. &gt;&gt; No, I'm I'm just No, you're feeling it quietly. &gt;&gt; She took the time to say this to Stone Beard, but looks right at you, Leonus, and like does this. Yeah. So, this is a significant amount of damage coming down range here. &gt;&gt; God, dude. &gt;&gt; 47 points of damage. Half though, &gt;&gt; I don't know if it's going to matter. What is What is half of that? That's &gt;&gt; 23. &gt;&gt; Can Gorg or Stone Beard survive 47 points of damage? &gt;&gt; I can't. &gt;&gt; Can Ron survive 23? &gt;&gt; Most, but no. You see your friends collapse, Leonus, as again she falls to the ground and you see that bluish light in front of her swirls and shoots up towards the ceiling and the body just stops moving. You three are in what are called death saves. So, here's how death works in this game. Ironically enough, the shoe finally on the other foot. &gt;&gt; Well, well, well. &gt;&gt; Just to be clear, like while I fall and while I die, I go, "Why did you leave us?" &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; And I collapse on the ground. &gt;&gt; I call the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and my the light from my cigarette face. &gt;&gt; It's like slow motion. Leonus is she smiles at you and they all simultaneously look betrayed and disappointed. But the way it works in Dungeons and Dragons, when you drop to zero hit points, that is not automatic death. You drop into what are called death saves, uh, where you have, uh, up to three rolls where if you get 11 or above, you move closer towards living. You get 10 or below, you move closer towards dying. &gt;&gt; Is a net one instant death, not 20 instant. &gt;&gt; Two failures, a net 20 is two successes. If someone hits you while you're in death saves, you automatically fail. So like if you get dropped, but somebody like keeps stabbing you basically, then uh you will die. &gt;&gt; That's fair. &gt;&gt; However, as all three of you collapse, you see yourself in a place of swirling mist. And the three of you see each other. Electrical burns all over your bodies. Hey guys, &gt;&gt; no one else is around. Not Leonus, none of the crowd. &gt;&gt; Are we like still slumped over like getting up or? &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Hey. &gt;&gt; Oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; How long have you been up? &gt;&gt; Uh, just got up. Don't be worried. Horizon is probably here. &gt;&gt; Where are we? &gt;&gt; I would have thought hell for him. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Well, we're all here. &gt;&gt; I'm a paladin. &gt;&gt; I don't think we're dead. It wouldn't make sense. &gt;&gt; Well, well, well. Will you look what the cat dragged in? And out of the fog, you see a pair of red eyes form. And a man comes walking out, who you recognize by reputation, if not by appearance. His face is horrible and rotten with glowing red eyes, but he's wearing a black metal iron helmet in black iron armor that is like chipped and danged. You know the face of the creeping knight, the god of Mory immediately. &gt;&gt; So this is my god. &gt;&gt; This is your god. I'll leave it up to you to what extent Ran worships him. But this is the god of Mory. That just comes the god of death. Yeah. Well, you three boys made it here this time, but not that skinny elf. &gt;&gt; Wait, you've met our skinny elf friend, Leonus? &gt;&gt; I have made Mr. Leonus Au's acquaintance. He didn't tell you all about me. Maybe he did, but we just didn't. We don't listen to We &gt;&gt; bring us back to battle. &gt;&gt; Well, problem there, champ, is you already done lost that battle. You got a real different fight on your hands right now. &gt;&gt; I I have to defeat you then. &gt;&gt; This [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] guy, he's got to defeat me. &gt;&gt; Why are you laughing? &gt;&gt; It's a undead thing. You hear another voice say, "You should not antagonize them. They are fighting their hardest." And behind Gorg, you will see a man appear whose skin is the color of seafoam and a palish whitish gray. And he has hair like seaweed, uh, interwoven with like long blonde dreads and wearing armor made out of coral. And he says, "Gork." &gt;&gt; And he actually puts his hands on the side of your head so you can't turn yet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Gork. &gt;&gt; Hi. &gt;&gt; I believe you have some misconceptions about who I am and what I'm like." &gt;&gt; Who are you then? &gt;&gt; Turn and face me, boy. I make metallic freaking as I turn around. &gt;&gt; Uh, yeah. No, you like you're like a coral like warrior. I don't know. You look great. &gt;&gt; I am Horizon. &gt;&gt; No, no, the Horizon I know is &gt;&gt; and he like literally like puts out and shuts your mouth. &gt;&gt; No, I'm not. And while this interaction is happening, you all see behind Stone Beard what looks like a pair of eyes that are made out of flames. And a huge almost colossal dragon's head comes into view. is Maracana, the god of Tennela, your homeland from long ago, &gt;&gt; sort of slides out and says, "Son beard." &gt;&gt; Well, this is a great family reunion. Now, can one of you bring me back to battle? &gt;&gt; Whoa, these boys are in such a hurry, Ron. I don't understand it. I &gt;&gt; I think I I think it's the whole sobriety thing. They don't really have that where they're from. &gt;&gt; Oh. a different pace. &gt;&gt; Patience of youth. &gt;&gt; Listen, hold on a second. Your friends are down. The diplomats are down. The enemies are down. It is just like literal and figurative bombs have gone off here and there's almost an eerie silence. Uh, what is Leonus doing? &gt;&gt; I immediately run as fast as I can. I'm pretty far away, right? So, I run as fast as I can. takes like a 45 across the stadium. &gt;&gt; The Uber The Uber's 20 away. &gt;&gt; It's going to take him a bit. &gt;&gt; And I go to Stone Beard first, naturally. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; And I I check I check on Stone Beard. &gt;&gt; You touch his Do you touch his chest? &gt;&gt; And I touch his chest. And I can tell he's barely hanging on to life, but I'm hurt. I'm exhausted. Thimble no longer with me. And I'm a little frantic. I I I feel like the only thing I can do I would like to attempt to do something like using healing spirit for example, but I'm tapped out. &gt;&gt; This is excellent. All of you give me your first death save. &gt;&gt; Oh, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] big big juicy numbers. I got 19. &gt;&gt; Perfect. &gt;&gt; Oh, hell yeah. Big juicy numbers. I got nine. Uh 13. &gt;&gt; 13. That is a failure. while you're hovered over me. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; I I like you put your face your hand on my cheek. &gt;&gt; I go stir &gt;&gt; and a scowl forms on my face. I almost feel your presence around me &gt;&gt; and bitterness is there. &gt;&gt; Leon, it it is like he's slipping away. And back with you guys. &gt;&gt; I'm here. I'm here. &gt;&gt; It's like you all can see from where you are what Leonus is trying to do. And you see the creeping knight looks up even past that and off in the distance you all see like a pale light. It's almost like a full moon behind the clouds. And the creeping knight looks up and he goes, "Yeah, Asher doesn't like to slum around with the likes of us. Hey, um, Stone Beard, no disrespect, Mr. Dragon, your buddy does seem worked up." And as he puts his hand on you, you do feel your life essence slip away a little. And he's like, "I don't know if you're going to make it, brother. Would you like my help?" I slap his hand away. &gt;&gt; What's your name, foulfaced friend? And why do you touch me and drain my energy so &gt;&gt; I didn't drain anything, friend? Would you like to introduce me, Ron? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, this is like our guy, you know, you of your guys. This is the guy &gt;&gt; is your friend. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I wouldn't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I wouldn't really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with him because of the whole like your life almost just &gt;&gt; what's his name? &gt;&gt; Uh the creeping knight is what we call him. &gt;&gt; I am the creeping night. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's like it's like a two first names type. &gt;&gt; It's that dramatic like Jim. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's like he's kind of like always like that, but like I I would kneel. &gt;&gt; If he's your friend, can you have him bring us back? &gt;&gt; I I can try. Hey, uh CK. Uh so not Louis. Uh, could you like maybe bring us back so we could like fight? Also, there's not a lot of smoke shops here. A little change maybe. You see, Horizon looks at you, Gorg, and he says, "You four, even Leonus have a destiny. There are things that you must accomplish for this world. A time of great peril is coming. You must be able to meet it. You've only gotten the smallest taste of what it is that you were up against. &gt;&gt; Even Leonus, &gt;&gt; a woman's voice that you don't see. You don't see another face. You hear a woman's voice say, "Especially Leonus." &gt;&gt; My god. &gt;&gt; And all three of them look in the direction of the voice and then just sort of like look back at each one of you. &gt;&gt; I I I sit on the ground crisscross applesauce. I start refusing to talk to everyone. I'm pouting. &gt;&gt; You're pouting? &gt;&gt; I'm pouting. Hold on. Hold on. He gets like I had kneel down in front of him. What's up, buddy? What's up? &gt;&gt; There's four gods. Four gods around us. Well, there's really five, but again Oh, thanks. Thanks for chiming in. I appreciate that. &gt;&gt; You all are having a moment. Oh, don't mind. &gt;&gt; Hey, with me, buddy. With me. &gt;&gt; We have five We have five gods around us telling us about our destiny. Yet, they have to keep us in purgatory so we can't continue the battle. Dude, we have we have one thing that we need to do here, and it's get back and win this fight. And you know what? We need you. So, I need you. &gt;&gt; How many gods does it take to get somebody back to battle? How many gods? &gt;&gt; You all don't understand how things came to be the way they are, which is why you don't understand what's happening. Meanwhile, Leonus, you said you were out of your spell slots to be able to cast your healing um healing spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes, I am out of spell slots. So, I've been I've been trying desperately to figure out a way I could bring back my friends. I think &gt;&gt; you just sat there going, "Hell no." &gt;&gt; The single hand beating on the chest, &gt;&gt; please. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I do know that one uh one thing and if you could tell me if this is something that changed. I don't have to sleep. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; The only thing I can do is rest as quickly as possible to access some of my remaining power. I go into a meditative state. I can't do my long rest for 4 hours. But what I do want to do is do a short meditation to find the nearest portal since we're in the the Nexus or the Terran. Presumably, we already walked past a bunch of portals to find and go to a portal quickly that &gt;&gt; uh I can go into. Is there some plane that I've been to before where I could seek an item or something easily accessible that would help them recover? Leonus as you are frantically trying to figure this out as you know you actually have the magical ability you're just simply exhausted is in fact all of you give me another death save &gt;&gt; can do &gt;&gt; same thing pure &gt;&gt; this is a one this changes the game for us &gt;&gt; it's crazy it's crazy that your thought to save us is to just go to sleep &gt;&gt; I'll just I'll say that from beyond the grave &gt;&gt; uh I rolled 19 &gt;&gt; 1912 12 &gt;&gt; 16 &gt;&gt; 16 That is a a success for each of you. Leonus, as you are racking your mind here trying to figure this out, &gt;&gt; you feel like a hug come from behind you. You don't see anything, but it's like if somebody's embraced you from behind and a head sort of lays on your shoulder. &gt;&gt; It's like, &gt;&gt; Leon, &gt;&gt; would you like to be able to help your friends? &gt;&gt; Yes. Diseodied voice for the third time in the past week. God, &gt;&gt; it has been I want to help my friends. &gt;&gt; An eventful set of circumstances for you, hasn't it? You know, even if you help them, they're not going to thank you. &gt;&gt; Feel the head sort of press against yours. And it's like, &gt;&gt; you still want to do this even if they're going to make fun of you, blame you. If I don't do this, I'll regret leaving them for the rest of my life. I and I don't have any other friends. &gt;&gt; You know, whatever they say about you, you are a real hero and you feel a kiss on your cheek. &gt;&gt; And you you regain a level two spell slot. You feel like &gt;&gt; energized. So Uber Eats is here. &gt;&gt; So I fold &gt;&gt; and I Okay, so now I have healing spirit. &gt;&gt; Uh am I able cuz I'm I was with Stone Beard. My hand was &gt;&gt; They're all kind of close around. I believe &gt;&gt; chest before. Can I use it on all of them at once? Is it &gt;&gt; I believe I believe it is an area effect for that spell. And even if it wasn't, it is going to be now. So yes. &gt;&gt; Okay. And uh I with this new with this new found energy and this realization that I uh through and perhaps through the love that I have for my friends and the regret I had for what I've done. I roll my d6 to use healing spirit. &gt;&gt; You roll it. But I'll come back to you in a second for the numbers. But this time, Leonus, you see when you do it, just like you saw with the arch druids, like leaves and flowers come flowing in in a smell of almost like the perfume of the forest as you begin this healing for you all back in this dark place. You see, they all kind of like look off into the distance and the creeping knight turns and looks at you and he says, "Son, I know better than most what you've been through. I know better than most what you're going to go through. I gave everything to save this world. And do you want to know why we're not going to bring you back? Why? We're not going to save you. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; Because there's some things a warrior, a soldier has to do for himself. And sometimes you got to rely on your friends. And you all wake up with Leonus standing over you. &gt;&gt; I instantly throw up because of most things. Oh, &gt;&gt; it worked. &gt;&gt; It worked. You guys &gt;&gt; Oh, you're Oh, you're back. &gt;&gt; You guys are back now. &gt;&gt; You guys are back. &gt;&gt; I'm so &gt;&gt; You're okay. &gt;&gt; Leonus. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; Did Did you do this? &gt;&gt; Yeah. I brought I &gt;&gt; When you all look at Leonus on his cheek, you see the imprint of a kiss in a green lipstick that just fades. Like while you're looking at it, it just disappears. &gt;&gt; You're left to get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] That feels wrong. &gt;&gt; Is that why you went? &gt;&gt; No, I've been here the whole time. I ran over to you guys. Little guy. &gt;&gt; Who's the little guy? &gt;&gt; Little man that you're that you're with. You know what? Stop. Halt. Leonus. We owe you many thanks. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry I left you guys behind. And uh but I'm just glad you're all right. &gt;&gt; Well, it's because you left us behind that you were able to save us. So, I think we owe you an apology. &gt;&gt; Sorry. Can I roll to apologize to him? &gt;&gt; Let's see. Uh, &gt;&gt; settle internal. Is that a charisma? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'll take charisma. &gt;&gt; Roll if you have to. You're a very charismatic to really charismatic. I want to roll. I I want to I want to make it feel like he doesn't need to need to apologize. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, that would be deception because you can't make him feel anything, but you're basically trying to gaslight him. So, I would say that's deception. That is a deception. &gt;&gt; I would like to &gt;&gt; Oh, we're doing a gaslight check. I'm sure he's got a I'm sure he's got a plus 15 modifier gas. &gt;&gt; My deception. Yeah. All right. We're rolling deception. Oh, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] It's a six. &gt;&gt; Well, Gorg, &gt;&gt; you give me a bad non-apology. &gt;&gt; No, I think that you are, you know, maybe that if you hadn't left and you would have been in the uh the outer uh beyond with us. &gt;&gt; Wait, &gt;&gt; I think that would have been more productive, but you decided to leave. &gt;&gt; You &gt;&gt; you guys went to the beyond. &gt;&gt; I I think he's a &gt;&gt; What did you say? What did you say? &gt;&gt; I think that you It's nice that you healed. Um I guess if you if you think it was nice, &gt;&gt; I'll just jump in and say ditto. Re &gt;&gt; you're going to say ditto. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm going to add a ditto to that. &gt;&gt; It's okay. I apologize for our team. Did you guys see or talk to anybody while you were &gt;&gt; Dude, it was crazy for There's like four of one person was pretending to be Horizon, which is annoying. There was &gt;&gt; It's like George's powers shut off. &gt;&gt; There was someone was pretending to be Horizon. There was the creeping knight. Do you like being dead? I don't get it. &gt;&gt; There was like five gods. They were all pathetic. They talk about destiny and fate. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to worry about it, too. I'm not going to lose sleep over this. I think, you know, if you do lose sleep over this, you kind of probably aren't cut out for this kind of warrior stuff. &gt;&gt; I did. They I think it's appropriate if you lose sleep over that. That seems reasonable. &gt;&gt; Scary, but like do you I I need to ask one question. Did anyone make you any god, any being make you an offer while you were there? &gt;&gt; No. just chastise us. &gt;&gt; Yeah, pretty much just like hung out with tree shield and then we woke up. &gt;&gt; There's the fake horizon and yeah, &gt;&gt; cool. &gt;&gt; You I mean you woke us up. You healed us. So it's like we didn't &gt;&gt; What I will say I'm not going to tell you how Ran feels. Only Ran knows how Ran feels. &gt;&gt; But culturally in Mory, the dead are all super fine with it. It is a very zen relaxed place. They're in no hurry. That's their whole thing. They like we have all the time in the world. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. And so, uh, people just like work on their technology and pursue their passions even though they're like some of them are shambling corpses and stuff, but everybody's fine with being dead. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, you you were just like not I mean &gt;&gt; I mean that's kind of just our vibe. &gt;&gt; You vibe of that. &gt;&gt; We just vibe. We just vibe and like cuz we don't have to worry about [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like you worry about like falling over and dying. &gt;&gt; I hate your god. &gt;&gt; Your god was mean to stone bread. &gt;&gt; Well, look at him, bro. &gt;&gt; What is that? He's wearing a fan. &gt;&gt; Did you see that? He Did you see your god how ugly he was? &gt;&gt; He wasn't ugly. Really? You think undead features are ugly? &gt;&gt; No. No. He had a face like burnt papermâché. &gt;&gt; Don't let him get to you. We all get a little rounder with &gt;&gt; it gets to me. The creeping knight got to me. &gt;&gt; Rounder. &gt;&gt; Hey, creeping knight. Wherever you are, you're ugly. &gt;&gt; Sean, don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] say that. &gt;&gt; You have no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] idea what that guy can do. &gt;&gt; And that was Horizon. &gt;&gt; No, it wasn't. Why? Why is that? Why is the Horizon? &gt;&gt; Don't even just don't. So you guys saw Horizon and F &gt;&gt; it was some other dude. &gt;&gt; There was some of the sultry voice. &gt;&gt; Horizon I know is a beautiful buxom turtle woman &gt;&gt; and that person was not. So &gt;&gt; and you saw the dragon uh Marana which would be the god of &gt;&gt; Marana. Marana was cool. &gt;&gt; You have yet to encounter Marana. I I have only met I've I've met the god of Mory and I've met uh the the &gt;&gt; You have met the creeping knight. You have met Horizon and you have met the goddess of Waldo. Okay. &gt;&gt; Leo, what are all these questions? Are you implying that you've made a deal? &gt;&gt; No. No. I just feel like I've make a deal. That'd be ridiculous. In my studies in the scrolls sometimes gods seem it seems like you keep asking a specific question about gods and deals &gt;&gt; and you're always freaking out. He wouldn't lie to us. You wouldn't lie to us. So I appreciate that. Your honesty matters a lot. &gt;&gt; You saved our lives and you've never lied to us. And &gt;&gt; Stone Beard, give me a charisma save. &gt;&gt; 15. &gt;&gt; How does Stone Beard actually feel? Like the things you may not say out loud, like in your heart of hearts at this exact moment. How does Stone Beard actually feel? I know he's lying to me, but I don't want him to lose face in front of the group and admit it to everyone. &gt;&gt; Uh, how are you feeling about what your experience just was of having nearly died, of having seen these gods? Like, again, deep down inside, &gt;&gt; there's a terrible pressure of duty due to the gods prophecies that we must now impart on. Uh, and I think there's frustration because I've been through this before in the war where the gods send you on a mission and it feels like they're playing a game yet they lift no hand to help you in that game. So, &gt;&gt; I think it's mostly frustration and anger uh at powers I can't control. Stone Beard, even though you don't say that out loud, &gt;&gt; you hear a very small voice say it's it's okay to be frustrated. It's it's it's okay to be scared. It's it's a lot. This world is a lot. And you all see a small person appear on Leonus's shoulder, and he's holding his bow, but he's not pointing it at you. And he goes, "What you did was very brave. you. Yeah. I I couldn't have done this. And And what Leonus did was brave. It was smart. You're right. If he hadn't fallen back, you all might be dead now. I mean, you guys you guys are heroes. What What is your name, little one? I'm Thimble. I I instantly freak out and I say, "Master, &gt;&gt; sorry. Sorry. It's just &gt;&gt; It's a monster. &gt;&gt; It's on your shoulder, Leot. I want to save you. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I should have told you all sooner. &gt;&gt; I'll cut its head off. It's fine. &gt;&gt; Do not cut Dibble's head off. &gt;&gt; That's I mean, you can try. I will put this in your eyeball, man. I say I'm trying to be cool with you. &gt;&gt; Is this tissue? &gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] He did already put one in you. &gt;&gt; Oh, you're the one who hit him earlier with the &gt;&gt; I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] my pants when that happened. &gt;&gt; I know. It was awful. &gt;&gt; I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] my shell. &gt;&gt; I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up my back. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Like a diaper blow out. &gt;&gt; Does Does he still have his daughter in his shell? &gt;&gt; Yeah, she was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] freaking out. &gt;&gt; GJ, this is a perfect segue. GJ kind of shimies out of your shell and flies over to you, Leonus, and immediately starts nuzzling and you just feel waves of gratitude coming off of her &gt;&gt; that she does that. &gt;&gt; Coots also jumps up and just starts chilling with Thimble, &gt;&gt; just kind of like sniffing at Thimble. Hold on. Just visually, just visually here, I've got three things. I will I will say immediately when Coots goes towards Thimble like he pulls a sword out and he's like ah you're not the first cat that's tried it and then like oh oh &gt;&gt; Coots just pawn at the sword. &gt;&gt; Oh, we're doing this. &gt;&gt; I'm a little I'm kind of like this, you know? &gt;&gt; There's quite a lot. Yeah, &gt;&gt; there's the Can you guys There's &gt;&gt; No, you're a little zoo now. Just make this quick. &gt;&gt; Oh, sorry. Yeah. Uh because you're right. Uh, Thimble is pretty small, but again, GJ's the size of a cat. So, uh, he does sort of like fly away and he goes like, "What? What is what's what's her her? Is it a heroot coots?" &gt;&gt; Made her myself. Yeah, our friend [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a dragon. &gt;&gt; That is This is my cat. I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; That is Jesus. &gt;&gt; So, I just want to tell you about our friend [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a dragon. &gt;&gt; That is a specific response. But, um, I mean, and and you see, he just kind of like put his hands over GJ's ears. He's like, "She she's a baby. Don't just let your mother &gt;&gt; You shouldn't speak so callously. &gt;&gt; Oh, she's going to learn at some point. &gt;&gt; I &gt;&gt; I mean, while while we're talking about gods putting their fingers on the scale, like I've been sent to keep an eye on Leonus to help, but I'm here to help all who &gt;&gt; Petraor. &gt;&gt; Who? &gt;&gt; The goddess of Walden. She's so &gt;&gt; Are are any of us from Walden? &gt;&gt; Uh, no. None of you are from We've all been there. Uh you you two are from Leo uh the the the pirate kingdom. Uh you are from Tennela the the the realm of men. You are from Mory the land of the dead. Uh you don't have any team members from Waldain which is uh uh the the lands of forests and the elves and in and nature spirits and none of you are fromu which are the heavens um which is where the angelic and celestial beings live. Now, Thimble, why were you sent as a sort of some sort of tutorial item for Leonus? Is it because Leonus' proficiency in combat to die? &gt;&gt; Is it cuz he's so slow? &gt;&gt; Maybe it's gives you like the slow rotate and looks at you, Leonus. And it's like &gt;&gt; to help &gt;&gt; help with help me &gt;&gt; stuff. &gt;&gt; Just help me. &gt;&gt; Just help you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. things &gt;&gt; totally of your own will. Just God's having fun. &gt;&gt; Hey, Leo. I'm getting the sense that you're just you're not really being honest with us. &gt;&gt; It's &gt;&gt; It hurts when you do that. &gt;&gt; You just look frozen. &gt;&gt; It can be hard to open up to you guys sometimes. &gt;&gt; You guys are dicks to him. I'll say it. He didn't want to say you guys are dicks to him. Did you see you're alive because of him? And you do see like he very much starts to like turn red. It's like you guys are so mean to Leonus and like he does nothing but fight for you and be nice to you and like you see Coots comes towards him and then he's like, "Okay, I'm cool. Okay, I'm cool. I'm cool. I'm cool." &gt;&gt; And in fact, all of us look around and presumably the bodies of hundreds of people around us, dead and fallen on the floor. We can't talk about your hatred for Leonus. him [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a dragon right now. We have to help. &gt;&gt; And I assume there's a bunch of Terodan sprinting around counting up bodies. Where's Sanc Kofa? Sanc Kofa. &gt;&gt; After a couple of moments, uh, you see there's like a shimmer in front of you. It's sort of like a flash and he's standing there. It's like running his hand through his hair and he goes, "Yes, &gt;&gt; how can we help? He looks around and he's like, "We have to find who did this and we have to get revenge." &gt;&gt; Didn't Didn't we already kill them? &gt;&gt; He goes over and he looks at the body, which now is not glowing blue, and he says, "I fear it is going to be more complicated than that. Where's the princess? &gt;&gt; That's a good place for us to stop. There it is. Hey, that's a good place for us to stop. &gt;&gt; I told her to stay backstage. [Music]
