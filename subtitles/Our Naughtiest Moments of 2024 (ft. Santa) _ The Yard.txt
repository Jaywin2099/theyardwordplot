fell asleep and didn't do it the average college student right now just I didn't type it into chat GPT dude that's a different level laziness cuz it does it for you yeah but how you we already know a lot about Santa I feel like what you what do you know about him if you had a you know you're Santa tell us tell us tell tell us tell us do you know yourself yeah partly yeah I've been alive for thousands of years is that true you talking North Pole talking to that north North Pole one you've got moues of feed so you're feeding a bunch of elves you got a whole bunch of people working for you you feed the elves yeah you take care of them it's like a city You' seen Pro express no I haven't they feed so you got to feed them go watch that go watch theut seen in Polar Express when they go down to the chow hall one of them get sh it's a whole city dude it's and they have a sewer system Apartments all that there's are there just work on sanitation what do you say what someone's got to clean the sewer system the elves you when they take shits and pee yeah I don't think I don't think elves are they I don't think they just solely work in the workshop I feel like they probably like maintain the city too there's like an elf coffee shop right cuz you need a coffee shop yeah dude you're Santa you can't be saying probably asking you got know like a lwig version of Santa like I don't know the name of I do my job I pay for presence is not the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mayor of the North Pole he's the May oh he's not what is it some elected elf yes dude there's local elections but I'm saying it's different I do my job I mean that'd be good because if it was a multi- Thousand-Year dictatorship where one guy controlled a subservient group of people called elves wait this is a good idea we had a society who and we have subservient people already the sexist one don't be the racist one yeah you're you got to you can't have both different it's different when it's a different space what do you mean it's the North Pole what does that mean to you it's the North Pole it's different there's different rules this is with the same thing the Europeans thought when they went to other it's like the ocean like you can kill there it's not against there's no land in the North Pole it's just solid ice there's no land is that that that's a fact I look up north pole facts like two nights ago just out of curiosity did you do that before we asked you to do this or after I lived there for a long time but I just wanted to know this was before in bed 2000 years you've been there it's like I thought there was land under this the whole time it's not as cold as you'd think in the Summers it can get up to 32Â° f is ice not land huh is ice not land famously well I think it's technically you're standing on it is it ice I don't think land is things you can stand on I can stand on you oh but I'm not land stand on Ice H you there is okay that's what you're saying I'm on your team here just to

not wake up and be like babe guess what I F dream you believe who I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the other girl I had sex with in my dream she was so beautiful no she's not real I made her up she's probably like a combination of all the other beautiful girls I've ever seen all the things you wish you could be okay sorry pause Santa this next one's a lie yeah can you read the next one Santa yeah please formed a sexual relationship with his cat consensual oh well that's good yeah what's that about well why is it naughty I got my cat spay I guess that's what this is referencing no no you prevented your cat from getting spayed because you wanted to make it pregnant do you think my cat is currently not spayed and I also have tried to you failed your mission you failed which the pregnancy or the Spade the doctor stopped you you tried your best so I did it in front of the doctor you stormed theor all right okay your cat was in heat for so long we started to think you know what there's a reason for this failed to reply to a total of 263 urgent messages that's true that's my bad but who Among Us doesn't get a bit busy yeah dude there's that's fine messages who doesn't get busy with 100 hours a League worst fits of the year that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up why is that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up you by far had the worst fits of the year what it is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up cuz you got a nice I like your fit right now like thanks it's cute no yeah today's good today good also I if I have the worst fits then why does gifted hater keep [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] talking about me he can't keep my name out of his mouth Reas you just said it's because of the worst fits that doesn't make sense that's like his whole favorite thing that doesn't make sense I think it's cuz he SE he's obsessed with you right now bro he sees inspo the fits he's obsessed with you right now I know it's probably liberating to see someone dress like that cuz he knows that I'm not Shackled to what's cool you see his newest video oh he's going to love we talked about randomiz I watched five minutes and then my chat said skip skip skip so I stopped watching oh did you let them control you like that I I I I said guys we're going to stick through and then I got five minutes of them spamming Skip and I was like never mind I Buckle I Buckle to you folks unwatchable content blood wig wow is that something that happens to you a lot like you let the elves like run your life never no I rule with an iron fist in there dude you have to what are the five principles of being Santa be jolly yeah be humble okay okay uh diligent is a big one cuz you got to check that line twice it's the size of Rhode Island you can't just check it once so that takes up a good part of your year so it's Charly being humble diligence uh love is a big one but I feel like that goes without saying um right uh and I'd say punctuality is probably a big one really yeah you think you think you're punctual I'm pretty you only have one one day of the year to make it happen no no no there's a big leadup to it it's a whole operation you don't even think about the leadup that's the thing about they think the movie's made in the time it takes to watch the movie playing Christmas music is that part of the leadup is that you no no no no no no no no I I'm in the weeds I'm I'm you know I'm in the factory well drinking hot chocolate I'm most of the time I'm checking the list you're checking the list right talking about the list a lot chece Santa do you by chance have a COO who maybe you haven't checked in on in a bit you could be see messing with maybe I would sck to what you're good at and what other people do is that's delegation that's what I'm saying cuz when they got on you about the missing the messages it's like you're a CEO you can't I I can't be focused on and what if one of them's really important though Santa like it's like a like a a really important one that's like hey you need to check this like really bad well the thing about it is even if you really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up there's always a Christmas next year well it might not be cuz the Grinch that one year yeah hey [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the Grinch and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Krampus yep you mean that you guys are still beefing like that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Krampus and his green ass monkey dude last night last night yeah watch that monkey Grinch me and Alex were streaming last night and I said some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like like we're going to kill the Grinch and Alex like like very very seriously and sternly he's like we wouldn't kill the Grinch bro we'd kill crampus you would kill Krampus because Kampus hurts people yeah the grin also had a change of heart yeah yeah but the Grinch never hurt anyone in the movies he just tried to steal CHR that hurts people what are you talking about but he patched it up at the end he's cutting he's cutting the hams at the end said [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] The Grinch I'm telling you I wouldn't kill him why not bro cut his head off and show everybody CRA dude that was crazy while we're talking about it though Alex is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ass at games Jesus okay y'all couldn't get through two Santa what's up this a guy you might know him yeah he's pretty naughty probably you should be on your naughty list cuz he's so nice do you want to hear my impression of him what and we're spinning the wheel you can't get a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] double you I don't even I don't even get that reference yeah if you did you'd be busted up you'd be busted up laughing right now if you got it is he a god he's probably soome so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] man I I had us I convin myself like oh it's actually better to be funny than it is to be good at games he warped your mind he's probably funny as this guy this guy dead ass walks up and he goes you know what I actually think queso's fat he says that that was crazy it's like a thought and then he left and then Santa showed up yeah weird I I don't think he would say you ever see Oppenheimer yeah he's yeah he looks like that guy oh so he's beautiful he's got some piercing eyes sound a bad he sounds kind of lit he's also 30 and plugged in so oh he's super lit yeah he likes blade and second place goes to Nick come on come on come on come on come on you know oh come on bro 24 total okay what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is the photo though that's what that's a photo of you that is not a photo of me I assume Santa looked up Nick from the yard you guys have photos of you no yeah we all have photos of ourselves that's what you look like in real life what are my top five that's your face all right all right so there's only two right there's only two in the top five cuz cuz the second one is four the first one's show giant poop to Hank Green it was science related that man is a father dude that's not cool showing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to people is I don't like that it was like it was like a big it was like in a hospital like bed it was like the biggest Hospital poop ever taken wait I like Santa's like uh almost like morality he's like showing your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to a homie that's chill that's chill showing a poop stranger no poop what was a stranger I mean he was kind of a stranger they met that day yeah well a car well if you Google someone you're no longer strangers and then you meet them well that's nope that's what your you said that with conviction I did I shouldn't have that's that's a dangerous Sound by the second thing that Nick is naughty for and the final is and there's only two which is pretty good it's very big text and it says D and D what what does that mean those no one knows cuz we've never heard of it or seen it and probably never will is it like it's like a soda I don't understand do you know what D and D is Santa heard that was supposed to come out in March that's what that's what the elves are chatting about sant's got one elf just F5 on the patreon every day and every day that elf reports no new news well some of the I've heard some of the elves they they thought they think it's an elaborate joke they think it's not going to come out at all by the way those people are good at what they do elves yeah it work hard bro you know I wouldn't say those people that cuz they're not people you mean by that the elves I how to refer to them he said those people are good at what they they do is that not a nice thing to say um doesn't feel nice oh are you an elf [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] reporter like what is this why am I on blast you're not even an elf my 23 and me something I didn't share with you guys lot of Greek MoDOT of

and maybe you ignored the signs how would I have had the tools to see it coming couldn't you give him like a book that's like love and peace or something we tried we gave him candy we gave him a to train one year okay oh well he liked trains a little too much I just I I hate to get political on the show here but I was thinking I was watching a World War II documentary I'm like I wonder in

they're like landing on your roof going down the chimney leaving you goodies you go on that route yeah usually they do kind of I feel like that's part of the problem is that they would uh flood the

nurtur thing too yeah I feel like they're probably nice but feel like you haven't thought about a lot of this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Santa I'm bringing you real questions that I think about all the time but you're just like thinking about toys and Rhode Island and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you don't even [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] put a tree up or lights so or have you got anyone a gift this year I did I actually got everyone gifts but they're in my car did you wrap them no then it doesn't count doesn't count what they have to be wrapped they have to be wrapped yeah they have to be wrapped so wait if I got if I got my friend a million dollars I wrap it up is not a gift it's definitely not a gift not it's not a Christmas gift I'll tell you that mhm maybe you gave him a gift on Christmas like Christmas gift W that's powerful I'm starting to understand you Santa I still don't understand why you don't want to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dismal the Grinch in front of in Town Square in front of everybody but he changed is there capital punishment in the North Pole what's that the death penalty we don't even have police man real base [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we defunded that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's all it's all elf social workers the community decides what to do they C worked in the North Pole gone come on let's go what's the last crime that happened in the North Pole that the community kind had to deal with oh let's think let me think is it kind of like is it the type of place like somebody steals a bike and everybody would be shocked to their core yeah there was a hit and run though there was a h run a while back it's one car it's a slay wait hold [Laughter] on I need you to realize it it doesn't stay parked all year and just gets used one year I'm saying there's not a lot of people who drive that thing right no there's about yeah there's probably seven or eight of us and so one who are the seven people driving s that El they've worked their way up dude I'm telling you guys it's a whole operation you got to con see you got to con okay okay I get asked this a lot if you weren't doing the job you currently doing what would you do instead oh God major league baseball player I'd be a pcture for the Yankees dude you really think so Yanke Nick claws would be a closer you think if you're 104 High fastball you're you're on the Yankees you're on the Yankees last year you beat the Dodgers last year last like yeah they're in the World Series I guess this year would you be the yeah s you ever seen to you ever seen that movie with Dennis Quaid where he's like a really old baseball pitcher you think you'd be like him no I haven't seen that but I think I could do that I could do anything I'm Santa you can do anything anything [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you can't be the Grinch you couldn't you couldn't hate Christmas couldn't hit silver in League I couldn't you you don't think Santa could hit silver in Le not the way that bar moves you think Santa could hit so crazy it's crazy you play like Christmas Bard yeah I love Christmas like theme stuff all like it's sick you put a tree up at your house yeah of course a fresh tree fresh tree yeah I bought a real tree whoa I watch guys I watched three Christmas movies back to back the other day and made a gingerbread house what what Christmas movies um I forget the names but one was Ryan Reynolds it was a uh it was a romcom I forget the name the second one was the Queen Latifa movie where she finds out she has like huh just friends no lake or some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that one's fire but uh it was a queen with movie where she finds out she has like the brain anism thing and she goes on like this big Christmas Vacation uh that one's fire and then I watched red one the new rock how was it Santa so good dude looks terrible so good dude it's not it's awesome wow it's awesome yeah it's awesome as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's the rock Alex this right now is there anything you don't like anything don't like hate yeah and suicide boys probably I don't like suicide boys I don't like I don't like when things are done in bad taste right like when you tell your friend you'd [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] him till he stinks yeah that's not I don't like that yeah but that's not in B I don't like N I don't like things that are nasty I don't like when you show a stranger an awesome big ass poop that was on like a medical bed [Laughter] pan he was a scientist it's nasty dude wonder if he had like input he showed his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] penis YouTuber so what's the difference here you're being [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] weird wait my penis isn't nasty what's not could be I think it's easier to say his penis is nasty than a giant medical I'd rather see a penis a if a pulls his penis out right now God forbid he doesn't see that um I'd love you like that's awesome and laugh but if you show me poop I'm like dude [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] why are you show like that going throw up I'm going throw up don't show me like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] smoth despite being big poop is nastier than penis cuz poop you dispel penis you keep penis is on your waist but poop is natural and poop is waste everyone poop yeah but but like it's that's literally the you're getting rid of it excreted e you know what I mean like the whole point of it is you get it out of you cuz it's the worst parts of you no it's not the worst it is cu get rid of flies like it it's the worst if you kept it in you what happens dude flies I see poop and they're just like wow awesome dessert dirt I think about that a lot I was like I I think about I thought I had this thought as a kid I was like 10 years old now it's like it flies like poop that must mean it just tastes like ice cream to them yeah you it's just it's all the best [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I think if they could make ice cream they'd be doing that no they like poop cuz it's like it's their ice cream it's like hot ice cream that stinks and it's like gross as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah not to a fly that's what I'm saying think perspective a fly would 100% if they could just have ice cream every day instead of poop we have ice cream they go poop immediately I I would love to trap several flies in a box we do like a Mr Beast Challenge on a bunch of flies I tra 10 flies in a box with ice cream and human [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they go ice cream every time I like you're just contextualizing scientific studies as Mr Beast experiment yeah so I want the kids watching to kind of understand and then there's like a pirate software Tik Tok about it it's like the thing about flies eating [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is no cuz poop yeah there you go CU poop is not what flies what he draws flies with Joy so here's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] here's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Po and he draws and he draws the poop on like notepad that's cool uh all right not your nice streamer Edition queso nice as hell like the probably the nicest okay he's up there he's up there I feel like you got to be up there okay uh Caroline Quan I'm gonna say nice I don't really nice you

lover yeah why cuz a day of holiday cheer you had a stable family Growing Up Christmas lover you had yeah but then you got a new one he's awesome Christmas Christmas lover or Christmas hater Christmas hater let's go really let's go if I had to pick a side can you guys break that down like why you don't like what's wrong with it what where's the bad parts of it why don't you like Christmas I don't like doing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that I just got to take down like in a week what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] does that even mean what I'm sorry what's the what sense does that dude I don't think anything like anything tied to Christmas like the aesthetic or like the decorating the tree like none of that is it's a capitalist holiday fun thing for me I like the part where I just spend time with my family now I like that part he prob the Snowman had on you're not like that's not fun to me this is not fun for you yeah that's not a that's not CH doesn't do it for you this doesn't do for you this do nothing for you marvelous set okay the set is my probably my favorite part the set that's a part you're complaining about no no no now I'm realizing that people feel this way about their homes yeah imagine walking into your home and you smell fresh U tide and you see like sparkly twinkly lights and there's and in in buddy holidays is that what your house is like right now buddy holiday CH not rooting on an open fire and there and there's you're baking cookies Dr eggn tea cookies yep and and and you're doing all that and then like you're doing the same old [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like you're booting up a lux game and you want to see everything but now you just see it with twinkly lights and it's red and green dude the Summoner Rift should have Christmas lights all over it right now that' be that would be awesome wouldn't that be fire that's the thing about people like I don't know game developers whoever they're lacking if you're not doing a Christmas event what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is that about it's like R did a long long time ago I think it's went woke let me ask you something I'm Santa what about people that don't celebrate Christmas well [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] them [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] him okay but what so Hanukkah no Santa's got beef with Hanukkah wow [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that yeah you fck eight candles and all that no I want to drop off gifts at your house and you're going to you're going to deny me of that privilege you want yeah right so you're saying I don't get to bring you Joy right and that sucks for I that sucks for me I got an audio nice Sant Luigi [Music] mangion let's not put s on the spot um H I think probably I don't know maybe nice cuz he's doing it for the better like it's the same thing of like would you shoot a million or no Santa million dogs one human but would you kill one human to save millions of other humans yeah but were any humans saved by this action they could maybe it could like it could be the Catalyst you just reinvented the trolley problem but the easiest version of it yeah one the very first yeah and no dogs involved at all so it's even easier imagine the energy if you killed a million people it's all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I me look I'm personally [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up after you said Tom kench is nice he is nice and and adol Hitler's nice like that's been I didn't say I said he's probably he's ni you know why Tom kench ate that woman cuz she was a healthcare CEO mhm now exactly and now and now people it it's going to spark something bigger now sona's got Healthcare doesn't have to pay a giant [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] deductible in bottom Lane the premiums dropped dude after Tom kench took action I think I think I think Tom kench should not be considered nice purely off of being purely off the size of that tongue oh come on Purely off the strength of it that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up you saying he shouldn't be nice because of the time I don't think there's anyone nice with that that the fat tongue can't be nice but it makes you feel nice with it what about that I don't think he does oh he does I don't think he does okay you don't think he's nice with that tongue no really no dude you don't think if he loved you and you came home to Tom kench every night he wouldn't be nice I think he would be can we just have sex with your penis this time is what I would say probably what you said what about his penis if I'm Tom kench's wife Margaret kench well you'll be eat eating in a river very quickly this nasty work all in one bite I'm enjoying this candy you know what I like about Christmas we did sorry did you oh my god what what

actually went through more effort than normal to forget it uh what's your favorite Christmas gift Santa I think a GameCube when I was a kid probably was probably huh um yeah I did know but I I think

this is from my father before he passed my father's alive my dad's alive um sorry you didn't even want to put that energy out there I didn't I didn't want to probably a GameCube what's yours a we really you know that this is awesome you I don't even start with me dude youal you just said yours was a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] VHS Star Wars box set no it was DVD set [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] okay that's even worse cuz you're like oh my God I don't have to rewind it now I can rewatch yes I was really excited about that that's not nerdy yeah I didn't know do that this is new technology there's no way your best Christmas gift was DVDs swear to God ever I yes ever I remember cuz I opened my M you have an Xbox I opened my mom's bedroom and I saw the DVDs and I was so surpr I was so taken back cuz I didn't ask for it oh you sniped him I know I like I just like it happened to be like front and center and I remember like being super excited I like oh my God cuz I didn't even think that that could be a gift how about this Santa if if someone gets you a Christmas gift they wrap it and everything but you saw it before they wrapped it cuz you were spying like he did with I was I swear to God I was is that a Christmas gift it is but you don't deserve it and that and and that might hurt you next year o and next year what happened what you get what happened oh my father died okay Santa s dial back the dial back the punishment system what the dude you were givit and you took his dad's life the wrath of Santa Claus I had to I had to S I think you might if I could go back in time I would have shot Hitler in the back of the head what for sure how Noble of you I don't know if there the comparison between those two imagine imagine that's how World War II ended like it's like a giant Front Page New York Times Like World War II is over and it's just a guy in a Santa costume that's what red one's about actually it's not too far off kills ad off it's pretty similar to that type of deal yeah you guys should watch it man wait what was yours uh Xbox 360 yes it's all gaming consoles for you guys yeah we what's going on with that we one time Santa one time Santa you got me a gift of uh you it was a it was a box and I opened it up and I was like this is a box of yogurt flavored Cheerios why is this my gift Santa why did you do this that was probably a mixup and then I open I opened up the box and it had two GameCube games on the inside y you got pranked that was trick the elves elves are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] man I can't control them all Santa okay before against I had this friend growing up and his dad got him like you know like the Box in a box in a box and he kept opening it was a huge box he kept opening it and at the very end was a small wooden box just a cube that had an x on it and he went it's the new Xbox oh are you for or against thate [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I would have shot him if I saw that dude when I was I thought you were going to say it was going to be an awesome diamond ring and they got engaged this was a thing no it was his father yeah yeah I'm noticing you marry me S infractions of what deserve punishment mostly have to do if you've disrespected Christmas you've done anything bad outside of that he's like I me I'm merely a man dude one of the most evil things I ever almost did that I got got stopped I think by like my mom or like my grandma like that was a thing what you just described people would like do that they'd like re they put like oh it's a Xbox 360 like spins or whatever and when I was a kid I think I I must have been under the age of 10 uh I had this idea or maybe I was like I don't know I think it was a Guitar Hero box or something similar and I had the idea to like bring over I got Guitar Hero for Christmas and it was like the whole you know the Box had the whole guitar in it and so it was like the big one and I had the idea to like put something else in it and like give it to my neighbor as a gift but just wouldn't bear you're reusing the box of the present as a prank gift to prank another kid you put in it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I I'm a kid I don't realize how mean that is P with a bigu big picture of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in it or something no that would be better weirdo um and I I I literally I said it I set it all up myself and they're like my next door neighbor so I go to walk it over my mom catches me and stops me and is like do not do that oh my God and I was like oh I felt really shameful I didn't and then she was like I'm still going to let you swear a bunch though what did you put in the box I don't like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't remember but it just wasn't Guitar Hero or whatever it was I don't remember what year guar came out guys I spent all my money on Christmas gifts really all of it well no not exactly I spent money on Christmas gifts and then I went to go see how much I spent and then I realized that it was like way more and I was like confused and it turns out I have I have 74 subscriptions 74 I have 74 74 subscriptions to what I have 74 all sorts of awesome junk like Netflix and uPorn and crap what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is you porn I don't know it's on there I think it's one of those like you subscribe and then it just gives you a whole bundle yeah of websites so I haven't even used that one but now I'm realizing I spent too much on Christmas guy who subscribed to porn I haven't even used it I haven't I haven't even used it but it turns out I thought I hadn't over spent on Christmas I thought I budgeted my life I didn't and now I don't have any money well it's funny cuz you say 74 cuz over 74% of people have subscriptions they've forgotten about I know how to I know how to get rid of them well how do you even find out that they exist lwig it's called Rocket

no longer waste money on the weird stuff that you decided to thing Rock money is that it's a personal finance app that finds and cancels your unwanted subscriptions monitors your spending and helps lower your bills so that you can grow your savings I found out I was giving $17 to Wikipedia every month that's really I know they only ask for like three they asked for very little I don't know how this happened I think it's cuz I did every time wi races I think it's cuz I did a Wiki race and someone said donate to Wikipedia you're using Wikipedia and I said okay that's fair but then I did the monthly and recently I've come into some issues with finances dude you guys have no idea we saw the account dude I'm not kidding I'm literally not joking it's not part of the ad rocket money might have prevented this rocket money if you had an email that was like wow you spent a lot more than normal this month and it said 3 million you might be like where did that go a lot of you guys think you spent 60 bucks it's probably closer to 300 and for me 3 million find a subscription you don't want and press cancel for Wikipedia you can't cancel with buttons you have to send an email but Rocka money finds you the email or the phone number to call and send a message right away even though you should support Wikipedia rocket money has over 5 million users and has saved a total of 500 million in cancel subscriptions saving members up to $740 a year when using all the apps features so if you want to stop wasting money on things you don't use cancel your unwanted subscriptions by going to

Claus or more not close not santap there's like an 80-year-old that knows about Santa Claus and has no idea about Mr Beast and there's a bunch of those everyone in the world knows about Santa Claus there's countries that don't do CIS you're saying is Santa Claus more well known that Mr Beast yeah absolutely Mr Beast is pretty big man do you feel disrespected by that comparison yeah what I understand where you're coming from but what are you saying uhoh oh my God the Google Trends it almost [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] met I'm actually I'm honestly surprised by the that's past day go go back you go all time that was probably in like July though who's five years yeah past oh and then Santa at Christmas time he goes through a big spike in De people like Christmas are just like I should look up Santa Claus Santa so weird it's the same reason I Googled stuff about the North Pole do past five years past five years Mr Beast yeah oh look at that oh my God you're trending downward Santa wait Mr Beast is more famous more often in the year yeah but his Peaks are lower yeah he also dude I do things once a year Mr Beast drops a video probably what every two to four weeks yeah but L if you're a YouTuber you want that you want that Mr Beast line you don't want the Santa line but like no but that means that just means people are discovering PE but everybody already knows Santa there's also more ad Revenue in December so you're dumb you you did you did really well during Co was that you what the WAN thing oh that wasn't me put it up there keep it realer wearing masks in the north po that

beating my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bust it all on that blanket huh I didn't bust on the blanket it' be gross cuz you couldn't you bu I don't think I could bust yeah I think early days when I was first beaten oh nothing came out it was all pleas word it was all plge it was all it was all over the game I said it was practice mode I said before I there was this guy in school who uh who used to say he used to make fun of other kids he'd be like y'all have clear come yeah which was an insanely custom emote or emote insult did that guy get presents that year probably no his name was Nick fry but he's not completely wrong because I think usually when you jack off for the first time it's like but he was saying it to people without knowing that he would just say it to make fun he would say it to Mr Donahue the teacher L was asking if a bully in his school got presents or not no he didn't get presents thank God I was about to the whole fabric of morality was about to disrupt there if you said yes you got pres actually I think he might have got a dirt bike I think you might got awesome red dirt bike awesome red dir bike baring that John he said hey you have clear come I think I was a good kid I think I was just I think I was just rambunctious at you're not a good kid bad you pranked too much bad kid also you did that one thing that we're not allowed to talk about oh I didn't do that one you're a bad evil child 100% th it Alex though what you starting [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fires that was when I was 19 that was my grandpa's fault that was way way worse way do that mean it was his fault Santa do you have an arson charge no no we didn't get charged because he's so old but dude one time like behind my house like on our land were these like four houses like they're old old old old and like we would use them for um for like storage but they're like all this like brush and grass had grown up and it was like the middle of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] winter so it was like dry and windy and he's like hey come with me we're going to go we're going to go burn all this I'm like hell no we're not doing that it's like it's windy like that's going to be a problem no he's like well I'm going to go do it without you I'm like okay well I'll go with you so um we start doing it and I have screenshots from my like old Twitter I have like a photo of me and my grandpa starting to burn it and being like burn [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with my grandpa like I think the text was like or the Tweet was like um was like might might face four to six and stay Pinn for this and then the next photo I tweeted with it is like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] house just like on fire but basically what happened was we started the fire the wind had picked up and where the wood was so old it was easily flammable and it just like went up in Flames dude did anyone live in that house um a long time ago yeah but like I'm saying no one had lived there for like ever we just used it for storage but dude it's four [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] houses and it was the craziest [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ever my grandpa's old ass is like trying to like run around and like move around he had like he fell in the dirt I had to like pick him up with like the Flames at my back it's crazy a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] light pole almost like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] uh like fell over it was crazy my dog my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] wiener dog jumped out of the truck and was like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] scurrying around and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this is like one of those AI videos Chang all the houses burn down yeah all of them did it get close to like your grandpa's house uh no cuz it was like so far it like a field between it but my neighbor was a farmer and they like potato houses were right across like this like tree line like like a ditch and the it almost like burnt all their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up let me let me understand something so you went up to you went up to these houses you lit them on fire and then you went oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they're on fire no they're burning brush burning like dead grass cuz it was like it it had grown up so much oh he was just trying to get rid of the grass yeah the flamable grass that's dry it's just it's like an insane idea that's what I said it's a normal thing to do but what no sometimes you lit your acreage on fire that's just what you do dude funniest part the photo I have of me and my grandpa doing it he's wearing like a shyy and for whatever reason these like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like Air Max 95s that like my older cousin my older cousin was okay I get it now it wasn't his grandpa at all oh oh also he was like really short I don't know why and he kept calling me cousin and it was weird dude if my older cousin was a minor league baseball player and he would just leave like drip for my grandpa and so my Grandpa would just like dress like a former but would have like Air Maxes and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on time it was the funniest [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but yeah we burned down those four houses it was around no earlier when I said what's your most country story that you probably could have just said that one it might be the most country one yeah wait did the fire department get involved huh the fire department come and like yeah hell yeah okay okay oh absolutely so they got them prisoners working you can see the smoke from town like 10 miles away wow yeah people are asking me about it got be like not a lot of people in your hometown 6,000 that's not a lot but people saw it and were like mine's eight mine's five 11 probably like 2.3 million for a lot we're a bunch of little country pumpkins aren't we we are some country we never had [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dude we never had nothing and damn dick didn't even do anything wrong C Santa you pretty much have [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all year yeah I I could ever need you endless
