cool and British that happens do you ever use the app Yuka to like judge products to like see how safe they are when you scan that bottle it gives it like a six out of like a six what is Yuka on yuk let's talk about that real quick that's what you don't know about Yuka you go in you go to a store you scan any good it could be like food it could be sunscreen and then it tells you the ingredients that are in the product and then evaluates it on a scale of 1 to 100 actually can go to zero and if like Armani does and like Armani might be and then for example like I'll scan a a scan uh a sunscreen and it'll be like oh this is 20 out of 100 because it has these chemicals that are banned in Europe that like give cancer don't buy this one and then you scan other products that are like maybe it might be like 90 out of 100 this is really really good and uh it's super useful especially if you want version of Googling the product plus Reddit uh basically but more efficient yeah and it's I I think it's even healthier it's like going One Step Above can I tell you guys the most random Rabbit Hole I went down yes so what this app does that maybe Google wouldn't is it talks about like endocrine disruptors which are things that kind of disrupt like your natural hormones okay I was watching this podcast long story short it talks about how the length I'm so glad I can be cross on this podcast the length between a man's uh pee PE and his butthole is shortly sorry is shortening like evolutionary a crisis it is shortening dude our ts are going to do two chemicals in the product from and that's why RFK to be in charge wait wait what wa wait let me explain let me explain why this is important it's not just about the length between your but what else no no because this is this is typically um a trait that is more likely seen in women and it's not about ooh are men becoming more cuz we love that but it's more so that if that length is shortened your sperm count is also shortened by AIC so it's actually like an evolutionary am I going to have awesome breasts one day oh my God maybe heck you could have them tomorrow goddamn free country this Ain so bad I look I'm

they had Danimals drinkable yog sry when you drink it is that when it activates or do you rub it on yourself inside out and it comes oh wait that's dope that's what I'm say because it's annoying to like muuk and it feels oily but if you drink it and it's like got a tiger on it with cool like you know big eyeballs and we could do a sweep states where the winner gets to go hang out with Dylan and Cole sprous that could be lit that animals one of them dm' me recently really no way which one we all know I actually can't wait wait I'm terrible I can't tell the difference between Twins if you

okay but if you want to go like bar for bar you want to go bar for bar I'll go bar for I'll mine out too try try to top this one okay oh that's that's believable to me message message or slide slide oh and just fascinating conversation to be honest really fascinating cuz part of me was like what is someone that famous really like you know are they are they normal think so would you do you yourself like far away very bro like it's interesting the most exciting thing about my life is like my bedet okay well well first hell hell yeah I've come to realize that famous people's lives are boring kind of they just do cool stuff sometimes and that's the stuff you see day boring cuz you can't do you feel like part of that is like you just can't go outside anymore like you can't exist in like normal society without having your day constantly interrupted lot things is cuz people yearn for routine and schedule they yearn for like the minds Aiden I do think that's kind of sad and it makes me wonder whether like you can't help but kind of be mentally stuck at a certain age when you get that famous you're that famous are you respect respectfully real question are you that famous I don't think I'm that famous but I do think I have certain downsides of that came from like being public the extr public for so long I have all the side effects and like everything go to the grocery store grocer there's a special aisle yeah for me there's a video there's a video of Ronaldo from a few years ago Ronaldo tries to go to a cop and drink of coffee yeah and he and ronal and Ronaldo literally cannot drink the coffee because of how many people are coming up to him right that's to me like famous almost to a problematic level like unfortunately for them a living deity level of Fame though but you're famous F like you're like guys I'm as famous as all y'all like we're just little respect that's the dumbest [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I ever heard thank God you say cuz I cuz you know why I know that's not true cuz sometimes I put your face in a dumbass thumbnail and that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] goes bazooka I'm just going to start putting them in Random episodes yeah well guys if you just you know slide me a cut I'm okay with that what do you want what's negotiate all those people who are farming videos on me were just like sliding you know what we should pitcher uhhuh there's a product that our friends have been working on they' love they'd love to pitch to you they have been dying to pitch to is a good one yeah I think it's pretty it's better than Danimals drinkable sunscreen I'll say that much but I think that's kind of a banger well I do too but apparently my cohorts don't they don't want to drink a poke do you like candy do I like candy question like every American some some she's not American are you like a are you like a thank you I do I I want to say real quick I think Aiden and I have a special connection cuz you're both Canadian Canadian Canadian both bisexual Believe It or Not Moroccan yeah I believe it he straightens his hair know about me every day wakes up and heats that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up I sat in your chair when we did the garden episode and everybody was like that is so fitting personality wise we both just like the Happy go-lucky loving you know we just love everyone if you know what I mean very really I'm you think I'm introverted uh yeah I I was so excited to slide down that slide I went yippe you did go yipp introverts don't go yippe it's real it is real have to teach time well the difference between you and Aiden is that when I walk in this office every day we do the podcast differ is you the one difference between her a yeah is it no no weirdly enough exactly the same but I I walk into this office every day I see him and it's the worst time it's the worst part of my day do you understand that it's the worst because because there's this idea that he's like oh I'm I'm Aiden I'm happy gol lucky guy oh you're an Uber driver I want to know about your life but he's actually evil and evil torment you know what's crazy evil torment she's lowkey Aiden pill the Ubers really oh i y to you about the Uber stuff yeah yeah but you're kind of Chatty sometimes in Ubers no I love talking to Ubers but I've had some tough moments where they have not loved me back wait what yeah well one instance in particular that I was telling L about the other day what happened okay so you know how there's different kinds of Ubers there's like uh and there's a certain type of uber that's like an Uber black which is a bit more like a private car well I ordered one of those because I was finishing up a podcast with Lily and I know this is going to go against my point of I'm totally not famous but I prefer those cars because sometimes I go in the other Ubers and they're like are you Poké man and they're driving me to my home the rules different when you're girl so when you're in a larger car I kind of just be doing this look we can pull to Google Trends to just stomp out the famous argument if you want but and I have a fake name in Uber so I'm like you know try anyway so I call your name is John Williams that's weird dude you made that your music is incredible please not dos me in this episod I will get it taken down okay anyway so I call um an Uber block which also tends to wait for you for like allow to wait up to 15 minutes thank you very much it says that when it pulls up you drive one bro put the Uber black in the bag bro don't chab oh don't CH I just saw the oh don't CH great brand they're really bad for your feet hurts how how old were the kids who made those you think three to six go continue so anyways I called the car and you know we're wrapping up the episode and they're like Frick we forgot to film thumbnails so I'm taking a bit extra cuz I'm I'm filming thumbnails and I feel really bad because I'm late to the Uber and you know I'm like 8 minutes into the 15 minute wait and I'm like I'm so sorry I'll be right out anyways I finish I go out I go into the car bro is pissed really basically pissed I mean you can tell when someone's energy is just like I am not happy with you it permeates yes it does like the aura is red it's actually the same energy that when lwig is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] late every single day of the podcast oh I felt that off of YouTube Right today right interestingly enough when he comes in late no energy he he's so happy yellow he's like that's when you got to like hold your phone and be like four Four's too high I go like three I don't bring that energ here can we talk about you being like we we'll have a sectional we reprimand him just we've done it over the years we will break your legs so this guy's pissed off in the Uber yes so I walk in he's giving me kind of the cold shoulder I sit and he goes do you not respect people's time oh I've said that to him I mean he fried your ass up you my Uber yeah you just start crying Ian no I initially I I feel really bad I'm like oh I'm so sorry um you know like I got this kind of car because usually it has to wait he's like even then like do you think the world revolves around Jes oh my God you sound like the incels online you sing my haters but you're driving me and he's like a bit of an older guy he starts driving I kid you not it feels like if it was my dad reprimanding me for the entire like 25 minute ride wow but also he's not my dad and I'm paying him wait he kept he kept [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on you yeah what God but yeah cuz at a certain point you should stop even if someone's late you should stop W this is your house well well what what if they keep doing it well yeah what if they keep they do it again to be fair this was my first time meeting this guy yeah time and I would and I would say the most productive thing is to move on well but what if they have what if you pick them up again oh would that solve it would that go back in time and fix it no you know what would solve it is maybe arriving on time what if Poké man had told the driver that her butt will be in the seat at 12:00 p.m. in the seat the butts and seats have to be here at 12:00 p.m. it wasn't in the seat of anyway so he's kind of la la and initially I was I was trying to be nice um because I'm like oh this must be some kind of misunderstanding I really did not mean to come across like that and I halfway through the car I get pissed because I'm like this is character defamation I literally I start telling him check my Uber rating I'm like a 4.9 with like 2K rid I'm a good man sir I like to be very respectful towards all my drivers I try to be as kind as I can like it is absolutely not a scenario where I like Baseline dises respect my Uber drivers or lift drivers like why would that be the case they're doing me a service and there should be mutual respect there for that anyways here's the cherry on top we're nearing the end of the ride he starts saying the least you could have done was let me know that you'd be late and I go I did I messaged you he was like no you didn't message and you didn't call and I was like and he's wrong yes oh he's wrong so I said I said maybe actually maybe your driver was slime all along dude no maybe your driver was slime all along oh no and then you scroll up in the group chat and then you find where you said the exact time and then you reply to it and it phrases like death note oh my God my last message slim slime camps the group chat slime is not this Uber driver is that right yesterday yesterday yesterday you were came in that group chat e sometimes so so what does he what does he say to that so I say actually I show him the logs I'm like look I messaged you and I said sorry I will be right there he w0s Y what a a him wait that's actually huge that they don't double down and here here's the best part so we're like you know we're like 3 five minutes away from my place and he his mood just like all of a sudden he feels guilty he feels bad he's like you know I've just been [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on this girl for 15 minutes that's crazy man wrongfully so and he's like oh I didn't know ghost quad you can tell he's like and in the back of my mind I'm like I never do this I give every single Uber or lift driver I kid you not five stars and I was like I'm going to dock him one star dude wait wait wait wait unless he apologized right do you have anything you want to say before I get out of the car still opening the door we pull up to the place the door opens he goes I'm sorry young lady it's been a long day you know I've had some very mean like ride or passengers and I was like it's okay have a good night and I gave him five stars wow so he dodged The Executioner's blade yep and then did help and then did driver did not arrive you charge back charge back start a new account John Williams 2 yeah so I mean some Uber drivers awesome sometimes you get a little CLE and then you solve it yeah you Uber everywhere hell yeah I've never been I've been thinking of getting my license again just for content to be honest I got it it expired I'm like should I get it expired no damn you should get how long they last it was a Canadian G G1 or G2 no G2 or wait it might be different by province cuz I don't think BC has G's you from Canada well anyways in Canada it's like different [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] letter whatever you should get your license get a get some Lambo start whipping and start barking that John yeah start barking that and then run over L okay that's a cutie joke sorry I thought it was a l joke a lot of people run me over I guess Lily and I both seemingly joked about running over L separate instances by my recollection by my recollection there were two people in the car that hit him women want to kill lwig what do you think that is think they fear me think that I think they fear me because of what I can do to them I think you like it if people fear oh my God I threw it in my mouth that was I like that I have a murderous intent it's funny with our friend group that we don't threaten to run over lwig we threaten to drive into buildings ourself yeah to get his attention to get him to you know schedule things oh my God are you guys that neglected oh God do you need do you need like maybe like three awesome friends who also work for you do I ever and we work so hard we work tireless and he doesn't and he doesn't yeah no that's fair doing that yeah zipper says four I mean if I did that my kind of friends would just like come cat it we like that we do like that one Evolution wait you never pitched your your idea well first before I pitched the idea I wanted to say I was driving to LAX two days ago and uh so the fast L on the left is a guy going around uh like 90 to 95 and a 60 uh on the freeway right next to the airport and I'm in the second lane and I'm merging over to the left lane and he is going from the second lane to the first Lane going 90 so I merge over and I cut him off but I'm like there's no way I would have known he was going that fast so I cut him off and he like honks the horn and he just keeps honking the horn he's like holding on to it behind me and I'm just like oh it's crazy yeah cut him off whatever he then drives next to me and drives my speed and I'm not kidding he holds his middle finger out the out the car for like 10 minutes like he just he just follows me until we eventually have to go on different freeways and I'm like driving like I'm doing the thing where I'm like I don't see him but I obviously see him I'm just like's and he's just doing this he just lay on the horn and he does that for like 10 until we finally MH have you guys seen the show beef no exactly the whole premise is like two people get into like a road rage kind of incident and then just stalk each other for weeks on I've been upset lately why it's cuz every time I look over at Aiden and he has that disgusting attempt Patchwork adolescent facial hair that honestly looks it looks bad but in a way that makes me like Angry like if you put if you put like monster in a Chia Pet like like just all that could grow Aiden why don't you get rid of it rid of it lwig I don't have a

the episode with someone who probably has never used this product I'm not going to lie Poké man you watch I did this I did this once oh yeah he did do this voice dude a guy stalked someone who pissed you off on the road so I was driving back let be careful with the crimes we Adit to on our public show I was driving back to California it was a two-lane Highway and this guy is in a Jaguar it's white maybe I I remember it very clearly play CM uh well the license play bracket had a a doctor's office number uh for a Glend day I believe doctor's office and we're doxing him and killing him the guy the guy's basically going way too fast on a two-lane highway I'm the left lane he gets on my ass I'm like this is annoying I get over so he goes and he just blows past me I'm in a car that doesn't go that fast but I I just start gunning it cuz I get really mad and I'm just following him and I'm following him and then I see this number on the license plate bracket so I call it and it's a doctor's office M and I left a message MH and I was like the you're driving too fast you shouldn't drive as fast as you're driving because it's dangerous and then I followed him for like 10 miles and 10 miles is CRA this is you have said a lot of insane [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on this show this is top three at least and on my episode y you guys and then he gets off an exit but I followed him off the exit so the tone of your voice right there this is not b not B wait let's wait and see how it ends it might be bass imagine they get out of the car they kiss hug make up and then he becomes a patient at the guy's doctor's office yeah and then he's measuring my gu and being like I'm sorry it's just too your sperm count is too low you can never reason why I'm not joking we get off we got off the exit and then he turns into a gas station and I just miss the turn and I say all right GG and I he out [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] maneuvers you what was the end game he pulled into a mall yeah he see anymore I think the end game is slime sits him down like a Twitter DM and he goes why were you driving so fast I wanted why were you driving that fast I wanted to do that really you think that was a good speed to go I will say this was this is very this is like days after my dad died so I was really you're emotional pretty emotional you don't have to hold my hand it's okay I appreciate it thank you I really like holding hands did you guys know it's proven to really like lower your um sadness hormones what testosterone I'm doing my gu exercises I I used to always ask to hold people's hands and I was like why does this make me feel so nice you didn't have 80 boys who liked you or anything or anything well typically to be fa it also wasn't like that in high school you know I wasn't like that were you not come on no I was like um I was very like nerdy student counsel were you were you like midf fragging in high school midf fragging was what was your GPA or do you have that in Canada oh uh I had like a 93% average how's that what does that mean Aiden how that for out of 100 I think we can figure it out that's just what is that I don't get it is that good no she said it it was like you know when someone says like my SATs were this and I'm like that's a big number I don't know what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that means3 out of 100 it was pretty good yeah it was P whatever admission you need to probably I'm your dad it's an A minus the a minus a 8 93 is an a not not in Canada okay I I get kind of confused in America GPA does 4.0 mean you never get like a question wrong you always have A's kind of you have you have A's you have straight A's which usually means that you've scored 90 above 93 on everything yeah 94 and you never had a class that like dipped below that also like in high school at least here like sometimes teachers just decide your grade like it's not really Rel to how you perform it's like if you're a really good student and you generally do well and you mess up on one test there there's Beggars for sure in my school there's like I literally I literally passed high school cuz a teacher liked me I failed a task I failed a whole class kind and he was like I'm giving you a c cuz I think you shouldn't have done this bad my be that kind of teacher my math teacher homi me I would have failed High School really yeah I smoked a lot of weed I played a lot of Nintendo DS enough I love Nintendo DS with games play play Pokémon in class I Love Weed what's strange it was when Diamond and Pearl came out so I was like how am I supposed to live my damn life in this stupid school full of junk food understandable so so he homi me and uh and I he's probably dead now cuz he was old how probad bet what was your first video game um like ever it was maybe some Pokemon or Zelda game actually Diamond and Pearl I remember specifically I wanted it so bad and I was like Dad can you please buy me this DS game please and my dad is so cute he was like I'll buy you the DS game if you bike all the

French girl who says the Tik Tok challenge o she did a French one she sounded exactly like lwig Burg amazing you are from Quebec so uh when I first IM when we first immigrated from Morocco to Canada we lived in Quebec for like a year or two years and then we moved to Ontario but French is my first language and I love at the grown age of 28 years old to still use it as the excuse anytime I missp speake we're the only two the same age I am ESL we're the only two the same age we we're the same age how old are you guys uh Aiden's 30 28 29 29 I'm 30 I'm 27 how old do you think he is him yeah as a

today he's bald you know what one day I had to pull up and see that too it was the worst [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's a good thumbil I guess I I made you who you are now now now Pokémon just what how old do you think I am I don't have I don't have a lot I have a lot I certainly can't work hard do you want a a a bit response or do you want an honest response honest respon H Hest respon honest as God is honest response your skin is great I would give you 28 to 32 what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] range is that 2 so she means 32 to 34 but I will say like sometimes your your demeanor and um how jaded you feel at times I'm like it's giving 58 no no you an old man's Soul I'm not an old man's Soul experienced a lot when I was playing Nintendo like Nintendo DS nend dogs when I was playing nintend dogs you were playing nintend dogs but you were really high so true I feel like you've experienced more you never smoke that good [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm not you never chief that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm really not a smoker no you never chief that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you never chief that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that cha you Tang the roach damn listen we're not going to talk about drugs here Pokey gave up smoke like Snoop did in French say I am poke man and I woo tank the roach is impossible that makes sense cuz on your podcast yes Lily's the drugie she really is and she just won't quit yeah what's Lily doing wait can we talk about the podcast real quick please would you guys be open to coming on the show and and I make you all sit in one little chair cuz we were thinking about guests and I was like yeah we could have like individuals it would be so much funnier if we just forced you all into a crammed space like the Cowardly kids from down the lane yes and we're all s or like you all come out of a little car like clowns and it's just like Pokey I would love nothing more to sit on Aidan's lap for two hours oh my god really are we stacked on each other so there's an order here ludwick's obviously the strongest our bottom we actually had to figure this out once we did a Christmas card we did a Christmas photo together bottom he doesn't give bottom he he takes bottom he's strong enough for the bottom we have photographic evidence of you being the bottom not giving he's the strongest giving the generous bottom can we go back to the strength the bottoms have power bottom they generate an enormous amount of power an enormous amount an important amount of power and that's why you have to be it fair enough uh I think that is a horrible idea but I will do it really I think six people is too much what if we're oil up what if we're butt ass and we're oiled I have one request naked wait then it would be harder to stack no we would we would fit each other what Jesus Christ oh gay sex with a friend is a bad thing we like Lego we'd be like Legos from the FL it is like Lego's butts your butts what are you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] talking about we get all oiled up we get a little crazy why are you getting involv mang they play they play Jenga with us where your Jenga pieces episode yeah we're all oiled up butt ass butt ass and a little gray you never want you used to get butt ass with us what makes me gray oh he doesn't get butt ass with he doesn't get butt ass with us dud he hasn't gotten butt ass in forever I got butt ass with you two weeks ago with your 19-year old friend you can't keep saying he's 19 years old it's weird when you say he's 19 years might have turned 20 recently Derek is older than me Derrick's 19 19y old friend he goes to weball Aiden is like crazy I loveball isall aw it wait okay are you ever nervous about going to weisa I'm never nervous about around people that oh if they recognize you no someone recognized me and I was in the cold put the fear in her head I mean she must have thought of it no fair enough fair enough I feel like I'm more comfortable going to bath houses in foreign countries that's why nobody I have I have a hypothesis I want to see if you support this I was thinking about this and I was doing like a little survey of the friends that have gone to Wiis Spa over time and I I of the friend cuz some people aren't comfortable with going they don't want to go be naked around their friends I get it I don't uh but I'm I'm chill with it and I've noticed a theme that anybody who's not American seems more likely to be comfortable with it and anybody who is American seems particularly uncomfortable with it I think that's completely factual it makes me sad because when you go to Europe or when I speak to my European friends are just like let's all get naked and have fun who cares a bodies it's a body nips out yippe yeah I don't know why in America we're so maybe Aiden it's because one time you pissed on the floor as a joke you think did you no I think it's our Christianity yeah it's you think to be honest I haven't watched enough of the yard to like have these kinds of understandings of you guys so when I hear Aidan pissing on the floor I'm like confusing that's not giving a in my mind it's confusing and it doesn't seem like me does it's because Pokey he made that up dude that's crazy there evidence evidence right that's the thing you know I have an affinity towards Aiden because we sat in the same chair so I believe that he sends me pictures of his penis for funas that was that's fine he is it to be the victim let's get real let's get real hon is this har in the workplace the victim we won I think that picture was hilarious was it what he's laughing PR picture it's a great photo yeah yeah I could draw that picture from memory these days guys this morning I woke up I was in my bed my Helix sleep bed that they sent me and I was just thinking godamn it feels good to have a helix Sleep mattress really do you see the picture of him you see the picture of him D I walk in here after taking a huge dump and he's showing them a picture of him of my juicy ass he thought he thought you were breathtaking woman and he was afraid to com I thought it was your girlfriend I'm like why are you showing me this and then you're in your Helix sleeve mattress it's cuz you look so C uncomfortable and when he found out it was you he started talking about you and you saying he would do irreparable things to you I was talking about how ghostly I would make it oh don't don't you thought it was my girlfriend you wouldn't why would you well he didn't make those comments didn't make those com no I was just like oh that seems appropriate yeah anyway he looks to sleep has a sleep quiz to find your perfect mattress that you can lay down with your I look look I'm usually a skeptic of like do these quizzes work I took the quiz and then they sent me that mattress and I liked it a lot it was a perfect mattress it was a perfect one for me why would you not want more information exactly this information scared you are you a liberal what are the Sleep zones I think it made your ass look better yeah it did the it's probably the memory foil and the cooling features makes it Su and tight so it's a temperature controlled ass wait you tell me if it gets hot in there it gets even bigger that's it's actually a little flab that's right Tyler so if you want if you want cake like Nick apparently has or you just want a comfy night sleep that makes a lot of sense go to helixsleep.com slthe yard

you need a mattress you might as well get a helix Sleep mattress thank you very much for sponsoring us use code the yard Nick Pokemon man let's change the subject I'm sorry Pokemon man I think I wrote a a list of things that I wanted to talk to you guys about so I actually want to double check it well I got one you uh Lily or Michael you have to shoot one in the head you uh myself good answer good answer good answer they need to stay together forever and if they don't I will be dating Lily Pichu which is also fine I respect that thank you so much she ly in the bag of the skull oh you know what I was going to say just realize what you said speaking of Lily and the podcast love him so much now that I have a podcast I realize how much freaking work it is so I really want to commend you guys on running this thing for so long you know what a round of applause for for all of us all of us who who do equal amount of amounts of work on this show like to not commend L for not showing up on time all the time if you really break down the hours we really don't even get paid that much that's crazy it's true that's crazy split it up you look at the ratio of time in to money out for each of us for each of us why did you start a do one I cuz you just you were biting our [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] huh just say it I was biting your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] let's go I I checked the patreon I said oh my gosh gir honestly okay so at some point like two years ago I woke up and I was like I cannot stream 6 to eight hours every day for the rest of my life love it but at some point 10 years in you're like time to try something new though I still love to stream do it like two three times a week I was like let's explore other media podcasting was one of those mediums did a solo podcast realized oh my God I can talk but I can't talk that much only Rob Dear deck can handle that smoke yeah it's a lot only Rob only Rob solo podcast he say he does 20 minute episodes on businesses is that what he does yeah it's crazy every once in a while we do uh if someone's like late to an episode we punish them by making them do one alone a whole episode whole episod premum so it's like oh the premium so I had to do this yeah Aiden had to do this I was late to an important episode started balling his eyes out dud you cried at the end I didn't cry at the end he talked himself into tears by himself it's our most it's our most watched episode on patreon left to your own devices you will just simply cry yeah I'll let it does I'll let it my God let me long enough let me know if you watch so I'll put your uh your picture on our website proud subscriber of the sourp is your highest tier what's your highest tier oh the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we have a $69 tier that's kind of a joke tier um but the actual highest tier is 25 not a joke do it okay small it's a joke it's a joke in the sense that you don't really you don't get anything except for the secret stuff SEC list if this episode gets 20K likes I will $69 sub and I'll watch the crying episode oh that sentence and you'll invest the S finish by sentence Olympus never heard of okay I will say I think you should move from three levels in the sour thing to five and then I'd love to try it but Pokey there's three medals yeah sorry this is I'm crossing my arms on this one oh yeah hump wait I swear you were asking something yes I did a solo podcast and then I was like oh my God talking to myself gets difficult you were you were doing that Audio Only too right I think no I was doing it not on YouTube so I did it on Spotify and I had video there and I was just like I just felt like a solo yapping podcast didn't belong on YouTube but then I also learned Spotify has like no real algorithm be very curated yes very Cur it's very curated and honestly if you don't have a Spotify original like tough luck bud MH so when I did a guest episode with Lily I was like oh my God our chemistry is so good should we kiss but instead of kissing we started a podcast yeah that's kind of how very similar to how you need some way to like unwind the tension oh very true is that what you guys do here every week unwind the tension and Zen we [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] was good before we had the podcast there would be issues like one time he had a had a stream for slim gyms and uh and we were a part of this and so we get we're getting crazy we're like the slim JY suck and fuckathon and we're we're on the stream talking about how who's going to suck and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] their way to the top for slim JY he gets a very angry message from slim jib that this is not going well apparently it didn't why because I people remember slim jyms better than ever because of that St they're a multi-purpose food has this podcast made you more money than it's lost you money and opport question you know what he would never dig into the numbers cuz I'm his numbers guy now I don't know the numbers but I what I do know is this podcasts has caused me the most headache not true the most untr you guys say vile [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about people constantly no what vile thing have Mogul male compared to Mogul M male famously yes you think MAA male has caused you less stress than this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] show when I say sauno is a diaper and I'm going to sail over the pyramids with him in a paramotor that's more stressful to you just so you know when he says paramotor over the pyramids that's a way for him to say kill him that's a that's that's a euphemism for killing for killing him to be fair i' I've never said I just mix metaphors here never said that about I did say sauno wore a diaper and in what I called content diaper play this was a long time ago I've taken my licks why do I feel like I recall this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out because batt there was a specific clip of sauno or something no I was just talking some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he just talked [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he's talk [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on several people Pokey and it always comes back to bite me one of 100% if you search think I don't think you have I don't think you ever why would I I love I love to put him on on trial but I don't think he's ever said something think about it he actually doesn't talk poorly of women ever damn crazy podcast in general isn't the biggest fan of women I've heard you had you've had like misogynist he once said someone is to do you feel like that's true this is not what I feel is true in this current moment this is just what the people are saying about the streets streets say you hate women bro they've said I love women let me ask you something po I once I have I have a male uh woman well I don't have M like a male order bride woman or like like a mailman but a woman male oh male like delivering like delivers my mail and got a male woman got it she she is so she's very pretty and I said on the on the podcast she's too pretty to be delivering maale face look at her face she so there was there a correct reaction to that it's a good it's good cuz I think that's how most people would react and but you guys did we did we made fun of you for like this is still a bit now because of how insane that is to say why is it insane let me assist you okay I feel like this might be an unfortunate case of not englishing very well as someone who's ESL okay we you should have said something like she was so pretty honestly I don't know what she's doing at FedEx she should be working at IMG models okay versus you're too pretty to be doing this is a little right you about pretty enough to be my wife it's like however I look I can do whatever I want [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah yeah it's it's it's it's saying that she shouldn't be doing something which isn't really for me to say exactly I understand well okay well counter one Aiden said that dogs should not go to public spaces if they if they're there they should be shot they should be shot by a police officer they should be shot police off should he does like I said that I definely that he saw a dog at AMC and and yelled at the owner yeah oh thoughts hey shut up Pokey that the fake news wres itself again wait one other thing I had on my list of things to bring up so you guys remember the Jake Paul Mike Tyson fight B I would like to discuss how the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] did lwig tweet like 10 things in an hour he usually doesn't I think I I think when big events happen he likes that why do you get on your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that sometimes okay do you want me to walk you through okay but I'll also say it was impressive how much I tweeted how much you tweeted and frankly I hate glazing you but they were Bang Your Tweets glaze accepted no legit and I was like he doesn't tweet like this part of me started thinking does he have a team who's tweeting on his have this is a lot this is guys I don't know if you've seen it was like 20 tweets I I didn't notice this go PE go the lo I know I mean I saw like maybe five of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] came over you goat it's me Shay drizzle mhm Shake drizzle Shake drizzle he's a yeah I'm sorry oh and it was all worth it that the best clip maybe ever you know what hey pack it up pack it up Podcast is over hey Mr President thank you very much respectfully real quick you're cuz you're an old League head you pull Shake drizis in highlights we're going to pull this up real quick you might have seen this back in the day okay I did you watch League content back in the day like 10 years ago I was 17 or 18 bro I don't think I was watching League I was playing League okay well either way it's me and Shake drizzle he's my editor okayo Shake drizzle love you so much that's he's going to start streaming and that's his sub sound dude she's so many sub why did you make AI Pokey your sub notification yes yes I would G him so bad you want to know what's crazy there actually is a league streamer I don't know if you get I don't mind whether you bleep his name or not but this is probably a clip that he would like whatever oh yeah using my voice AI as his sub sound and people were just donating the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] craziest [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] God he like he ha it's weird cuz it's funny when it's Obama yeah but sometimes it Obama coming on the podcast you're forcing me to say you know who's going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] suck some slim gym thing it's not the same actually what I do like that would be all so I feel like I cut you off about the shade drizzle no you're good there's an AI there's an AI Mickey Mouse that people do for German I love that one oh you're nice CU it's just it's interesting how there's there's like it's I if someone gets like XI Jin ping to like sing a country song I'm like I'm I'm all in but then there's a line that gets crossed yeah I get what you're saying and I'm with you I a journalist head off you say what do we need AI for we just no we just split a we split a blunt three pizzas you split a blunt split a blunt what a backwoods come on split a backwoods roll that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ourselves roll that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] our oh they help you do everything WR Rhymes better ma'am what strain uh it was an IND IND indic couch you're interested in your kids's hobby you don't understand what strain was it is it a certain kind Devil's lettuce this is like this is like when my girlfriend asked me about who's in top eight at smash tournaments likez she just she just loves me she wants to know how Josh did and she's like just wants she's excited I'm excited that's so cute so you're into couch St that's it bro I when there's a big event I I just start spam tweeting but only when there's a big event cuz I just I just say my so what I do is I say my thought out loud and if Shake Chuckles I tweet it I like that that's a good measure that is about itest not off not off the Backwoods Shake be laughing at [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] anything and I wasting about so you'll notice Shake has the the phrase I'm saying bro locked and loaded before you finish talking one two three three five six seven yeah seven eight this like 11 10 11 I think it was 13 total 13 yeah I was dropping the generous little Tweeter I was dropping him this is like me uh dude I can't even get you to tweet when your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] merch drops yeah no it's dumb as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] though so I don't do that understandable can I ask you have you ever heard of you guys can ask me whatever you'd like how about this one question each okay oh man I I love when when he Giggles in the background have you ever heard of Project M yeah you blew one time there's a lot of project things there was like a project something that was a riot game there's like project 2025 what does that matter it's definitely different from that for sure it's kind of a hybrid of both those I'm saying if you are if a sprous is sliding into your DMs if you mention Project M to him he might get excited and be like you have a 50-50 chance you have a 50-50 shot at becoming his best friend it's a mod of a video game okay yeah anyway sounds very familiar that's all I wanted to know okay your question SL my question um okay uh do you do you want do you want to start a podcast with me you Lily and Aiden wait that's actually a banger lineup That is a banger lineup Banger lineup and we leave all this crud behind we leave we leave all this and we use this set going to say we use this and we call it the garden and we call it the maybe like the Y I feel like there's something missing from the lineup I can't really no everything's there I feel like why after the yard the second word I could think of that was similar was the turd that's a good name for it the turd and we're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on them every week we're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on them every week once a week you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on we're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on that thing if you want some bonus [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we got [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on fear and who oh I did tweet out I'm going on uh the yard what should I talk about and will replied the fear and and then other people replied uh the socioeconomic state of the world o of course that had to mention whether I was cut or uncut that's key would you you've been on fear end right I was but I believe so forgettable right it's like so like I on it did his song Turn 90° to start the podcast at his desk oh yes we start talking when you started talking um I don't recall if he ever stopped actually yeah I don't think will was on the episode or maybe it was oh they didn't show up oh that's my favorite part about their show show up it makes it better cuz when you tune in you don't know who's going to be there I you know a lot that's really the magic okay chill on that I show I I've famously only missed like two episodes and one was against my will oh why cuz they're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] terrorists what terrorists Bo you loveing this word it was a rare time it was a rare time where lwig got a little real and emotional with his friends and it was like wow I didn't they hijacked an episode from I didn't want to miss that episode and we were like oh lwig no like oh damn didn't know you cared now you come sucking and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] at me only episodes showed up in a row and now he cares got me have you ever cried on camera uh yeah why the subathon right uh subathon but that was kind of not really on camera it was uh cue I think had reached out to my mods and they made like a book and it was like a like a book of my streaming career it was like on a fourth streaming anniversary or something that was the first time I saw you cry period the cuz we and last last I don't ever see him cryo he's a steel Fortress not last he a fortress is that true do you think you can break him down last time I saw you cry maybe given enough time yeah what and maybe certain drugs oo uh not not are you trying to get me to cry we get you on like a IA

you're by both balls are just up dude one time po man when I when lwig started streaming I don't know if you know this uh we all lived in the same house it was me Nick and lwig and lwig is like a couple hundred Andy and I had this bit where I would barge into his room and his camera was facing the wall but his door was facing out you know in his room so I'd open it I have my balls out so I've showed him my balls more than 10 times he would take pictures of them like what he took a Polaroid picture and put it under my mouse pad and then and then I kept it on my setup for a while just as balls as like a Keepsake but then one time like months later I was just streaming my like on my phone and I showed his balls on stream so his balls has been seen by many people yeah that was that was a mistake on your part that was but men are so interesting well you don't do that to your girls your gals you know freaking you show your balls to your friends what's the and my friends do sometimes send each other like sexy photos but it's never like oh my God here's my lady [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I feel like the difference in this context is like the girlfriends will send each other like the like evaluation like does this look good or like so is it for positive affirmation positive affirmation or advice to send to some El also sometimes to be completely honest sometimes it's like this is too good I can't post it online so I'm going just send it to my girl for the Gir and the girl for thep damn B you look so good you're like I like the idea valid if I had a vagina I would take a picture and I think I want to know what you would do if you had a vagina no this Ison you might like this it's going to beor like I'm sorry why do you think she would like this why would she I would take a picture of it and then I would turn the picture sideways and then draw a little eyes on it okay okay I kind of like like a little like right like a little puppet okay I have a question about the girls group chat though Jesus wait before your question I would love to ask like so do guys just think balls funny like forever 100% it's kind of just a universal if the shaft is in it is the day we met lwig we saw his balls and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this is real this is not a joke the day why she yes sir what's the C have you have you ever played Mafia of course of course okay so you in the night time walles and Dick were not involved it's house rules could it's cuz you're not playing competitive what roles do you play with so okay focus like someone who doesn't you know in the night time you know you everyone put their heads down in the night time yes so what some people woke up to the I okay here's the idea so you're like he's trying to get to make noise so we're playing mafia and then the the person who's moderating goes okay Mafia heads up and then when they do that keeping my eyes closed cuz I'm a town member and I really want the town to win this is Among Us I would show my butthole and then you would hear a noise from the mafia members cuz it would be shocked to see a butthole and then I would know to save the town's people who to vote out does this make me a criminal cuz I'm trying to make WR am I wrong for wanting the T guys uh I got a confession what's your confession your friends so we'll hear you You' dropped some pretty important ones lately my sneaky link decided to stop seeing me but you don't have a girl why how do you have a okay so well sorry that sounds sad it is sad a bit bummer so I'm kind of left to my own devices and speaking of device what's that in your hand I didn't realize I was holding this give me that it's the new F1 sv3 male masturbator pleasure console pleasure console that's exactly what I call Aiden but this one's a device that's right it's a device and because my sneaky link no longer wants to see me cuz he's busy in the North Pole or whatever you want to call it I have this new F F1 sv3 male masturbator it's at base control with new AI driven Sensations my God I think that's good for you solo pleasure is natural it is natural and it's enjoyable it's got smooth and flexible liquid silic two times more power than the last model and a bigger XL size option which I don't need that's not I don't think that's the one that you have judging by that one I don't think any of us really need it normal seems Seems one siiz fits all honestly seems pretty good but like look I just want to take the stigma of this away as you you you know some of you who listen to the bonus episode I recently had an episode with my own prostate and now uh this is for the front yes so honestly stick a little FY in there it feels pretty good you're exploring yourself two ends and I like that about you oh my God there's like an end there's like an ender on it and the fun doesn't even stop there did you go deep dude this feels crazy is there like a I got to be honest that Lilo Lilo I didn't go that thing probably feels dope Lilo is the only

hog and see how crazy he goes on it oh Lilo he'll Stitch you up so can I be honest this is fascinating for me I am have you guys done your mbti very unrelated it's a personality test yeah this is the this is the question I'm a data collector I love to analyze so this is a great um sample pull for men well in retaliation sorry I I well I wanted to I wanted to chime in and cut her off yeah thank you we heard it's good to have you here why women don't come on the par yeah it it is because of sliming not me okay I'm finishing my statement please go ahead so I love to collect data and um one time I was hanging out with this guy and you know still just getting to know each other um and we swung by his place and you know I saw the place real quick and he had a fake ball sack and I'm not going to lie I was I was revolted and Confused wait was he wearing it no no no no that's to me that was almost weird he just owned one I guess it's a joke respectfully respectfully you can't say this about our veterans yeah poy that's like makeup to us you got that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] blown off in Iraq and so I was it's a prosthetic can I can I judge a person's I guess emotional maturity by whether or not they talk about ball sacks a lot but I guess that's just like you can I had I bought a dildo one once as a joke uh in college I came back from a trip and I had a big old dildo and I I walked into my my my apartment with my roommate and I just peaked it out the door and I was like and it was like wagging he thought it was really funny very expensive joke I I put it in a drawer never thought about it again dildos if you didn't know this have antimicrobial uh surfaces on them and when they just rest in like a place like a drawer under clothes it a bunch of these like black spots started to develop on it and it was like my dildo had like a disease no it wasn't mold it was anyone who knows in the comments they will know dildo head it was pleasure juice it wasn't there was no juice it was no juice no I'm promising you no juice so you guys just love ball sacks because I'm not going to lie you just flashing your uh whatever in the middle of a mafia round fascinating well this is also it's an age thing cuz I don't think I would do that today I was 22 a got it here's the thing too when he did in retaliation I knew he was in another game I knew he was medic and I was out of the game so when when the moderator said medic raise your heads I got your lick I stood right in front of him he was close I stood right in front of him my balls are out and he just and he knew and he had to raise his head to make a medic decision and he just goes but you know there's levels cuz I think it's about threading the needle it's you read the room I think it's like there's certain friends that it' be funny with there there's definitely friends that I would not like for slime I know slime well I know what makes slime I know what makes slime laugh and if I send a picture of me camping in in a towel but the towel shows my flas of penis under it and I know that'll make slime laugh but most people I would not send that to well okay the first time yeah speaking of fake ball Prosthetics I ever talked to Aiden Ross oh i' had facetimed him and he said what up and then panned down and balls were hanging out of his shorts that's an insane way to greet someone and this is the first time I'd ever talked to him that's and it was a ball prosthetic it wasn't even his balls no cuz then he flipped back up and I think it was one of those cars with a Starlight roof sorry I'm on the way to prom and then he shakes the balls prosthe no like a Rolls-Royce and then he shakes the balls Prosthetics oh my God yeah you know what's crazy just like the duality of man to be honest because you know that's part of who Aiden Ross is but also if you guys saw his like stream with Trump I saw I'm not going to lie like a minute clip he was surprisingly professional yeah like ball dangling in his rolls but to be fair this also years ago I don't know if he's still dangling balls Pro fair enough this is kind of like this this week I saw an old friend of mine he's very close to me he's a doctor now and he gave me a knee exam and the help diagnose a problem with my knee right now and I was thinking about it while he was doing it I was like I have seen this guy blacked out shirtless in a bathtub and now 10 years later he's giving me a knee exam so actually I guess it's just the duality of human beings in general we're also multifaceted I and the other facet of this is I'm 34 years old spoiler really I know you your face looks pained because I thought you said earlier that you were 30 and now I feel like I was lying this is why everything you said about Aiden is a lie I was lying well there's video evidence for that but I'm the con of guy that if it's if it's still socially acceptable among my friend group in a consensual way I will be showing my balls and I will be doing it till the day I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] perished on this hurt there is a I think a bell curve where it's a bell I sometimes wish I had balls to show yeah I wish that I might were Aiden's was it how for it to hanging out of the shorts was it like a long proc no wearing wearing like a towel maybe we should asking about his actual B it was like it was like prosthetic yeah the prosthetic it different my first thought different my first thought when I saw the prosthetic s you my first time when I saw the prosthetic is damn he has long balls okay that's what I mean so he specifically asked for a long ball got long balls got long godamn uh for his ain't just unusual got long balls usually I'll hit till 25 like that we talk a lot about genell on this episode is that normal yes yeah isn't it freeing a little bit what I like about podcast is I feel like it's just a place to be a little bit more uncensored little goofy you guys are crass I can sit here and laugh at the crassness Marilyn Manson on the do you know about this do you know about this if we say Marilyn Manson do cuz every guy every guy knows this even know about uh your editor you think I know about Marilyn Manson yeah they are kind of the same yeah they are the same dzz they both went through the same surgery Marilyn oh I didn't know that what is what is it he got his ribs removed so he could he could Dingle his own isn't this a myth is this you want to know what's crazy you want to know what's crazy when I found this out in middle school I had a friend who was gay love him he was like I can do that no surgery needed I said oh oh that's game that's we talked a lot about that in our patreon episode that we did before this you think it's actually possible do you think it's even real I've seen it I've SE I've seen it with my own eyes I've seen videos is crazy though I wanted to see if it was real brother we that is patreon one of those like 360 camera povs dude the the train guy the train guy POV train guy most precious he would be precious do you think he has a ball prosthetic I think he has two less ribs in his body but just to see the trains from better povs poy you remember the first time we met no I'm sorry respectfully I canot really remember the first time I met anyone I'd just be meeting people do you remember uh the first time you met Pokey he was there the oh my God it was I was not there remember I only remember the first time I met Austin it was the offline TV Christmas party 20 18 oh really yeah I I was like out of town or something you out of town I was so like I want to go to my first weird big party cool I coach lwig on how to get into the party cuz you have been talking to zel right yeah you've been talking to zel cuz they did like Melee stuff and he was like how do I like asked to go to this party without being weird I'm like just Le you are asking something like that we snug into this joint and I and I said quote tweet and send the Tweet to him and then just put eyes emoji and then he did and he just dropped the the address and that's where we went we had no business being in this joint it was if you're listening out there it works it works it kind of does uh depends who you are but it might true yeah if you're if you're streaming uh and then yeah then we went in played smash within and I tried to talk to you and it and then you were talking to someone else M some someone I can't remember who someone important probably and then I was just waiting patiently and then slime next to me goes Pokey he wants to talk to you I remember this you are you are an evil Tormentor I'm sorry I got I got a cool girl to talk to my handsome [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Chad friend who looks like guile from Street Fighter oh I'm a monster yeah dude he was excited to talk to you you said and then you said okay and then I said hello and you went Hi and then I left and dude I forgot about I mean that sounds kind of dope actually and then I hung out with Lily zipper can you bring up the video I told you to bring up you got a video this not really it's not that crazy I mean that's not a bad interaction to be fair yeah I mean it wouldn't be horrible could be wor maybe maybe someday we'll have a friendship Arc and ball prosthetic hanging out yeah and then you're like goodbye dude tafo was there I remember cuz I was like oh thank God someone I know in this giant sea of people that I don't and tafo was wearing like this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up fit bro he had like a fitted ye he had like yeah he had Yee ye jeans bua jeans yeah I remember the Yeezys era I had him too it was I met licorice there C9 licorice the the league player I had a pile of laundry that I didn't want to fold I just left in the living room when we all lived together and uh it was there for so long and in protest of me doing this wore all of my clothes to the party just was he just pulled from my laundry do you get all your own clothes do I get all my own clothes yeah like do you buy them person I have a stylist that I will do fittings with maybe like every four six months it's great though it's like they just get a bunch of clothes you spend 2 hours try things on you keep what you like you leave what you don't want that seems like such a good idea it's just time efficient to be honest you won't you won't remember this Pokey but this is technically the first time I met you was at this event okay you remember this event what's it called gift the rift it is really long ago can we fast forward so maybe I can like maybe the next shot oh my God that's beyond the Summit House oh guys I'm wearing camo pants I'm filming this that's lit that's crazy shooting this he's he's behind the camera right now ly in the back I can't believe I genuinely barely recall this event it was so weird like it was such a cuz we like this Beyond The Summit was like a DOTA Studio had never done a League of Legends anything and also had never had like had never had like actual big streamers and so there was just like this you know wave of big streamers who were here one day time playing League yeah it was like a league it is I like the joke yeah uh it is the least viewed pokem man video on YouTube it is it is the the lowest that is our trainer I'm pretty sure like personal trainer yeah I could be wrong but I think that's our trainer zipper let's see the let's see the least viewed pokem main video is crazy let's check it out 400 views god dude that's hilarious cuz I've never seen this year I know that's crazy you could beat everyone who has seen it okay there were a lot of weird things that happened back in the day in the league scene I feel that kind of just like went under the radar and I'd like to quickly tell a story I've never told before as a new leag because we're all kind of new le started playing My Tom watch the episode where you guys talked about playing League I'm also considering a league Arc welcome back it's a disease welcome back it's a disease welcome yeah uh I'm reading I'm reading book right now I'll do that today because I need I I need to get back into it before I stream it sure what do you play I like to play or ADC or support okay we'll have a good time how you feel about Tom kench love me too fiddle six love amumu solid honestly I know you play him and I think that's good because when someone's trying to rank up they should play a champion like aumu that is great for the team that has good AOE that is kind of pretty good at clearing what a what a political answer tell us League te diplomatic what about an aggressive Lux mid me you you play Lux yes I play Lu smid twins oh God okay leak T back in the day way way back in the day I was in college still before I went full-time streaming but I was playing League all the damn time only 16 17 yes we're the same age so what year of college what second okay so 2016 2016 um I was approached by some people who were looking to make a reality TV show I'm going to yak about five girls that play league okay oh my God the humanity and here's the thing this I'm not going to lie back then I was like decently High ELO not like super High ELO but I was also in school and I'm like D1 before there's all those in between tears whatever that's real and I was like you know what if I actually like grind it out I could probably hit whatever or something if I really try hard with a coach okay so they're trying to basically do Sirens but TV show oh and you know when you're like a smaller streamer and you're like eh I'll hear anything out you know I'll just I'll sus it out they get us a coach we are doing like lowkey scrims I've never talked about this we're doing like scrims post Stream post classes whatever and this is also being run by a director in Hollywood like you Google him you like wa you know that's what they were trying to pitch but they needed the people they needed whatever whatever we have this coach we have a team etc etc I have the old emails too they fly me out to LA and I take a meeting with the director and in hindsight in hindsight it was almost like some weird ass date cuz it's like me and this old man did he like take this old man yeah like having a dinner and obviously you guys know me I'm like yipp doo about everything ever so I'm like yippy yeah this sounds cool I really like the girls and the coach is really nice and after the obviously I'm like okay got to go by I leave I have a great time in LA go back home ghost like the whole operation and I'm like like did I do something wrong or was it weird for me to meet with him in the first place oh his name and Harvey that's that's that's Rift haral what you guys think just no funding or that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up that it's it's it was like a pipeline well there there was a lot of problems with the production you wanted to piece it together and we frosted date angle was going to work but like you weren't into it no but also would it be normal to have like a dinner with a director that you're going to work on something if you're like a if you like I could see like a like definitely like a director being like I don't know how to put it like if it's a one onone I think it's a little weird whole we five you feel you if you were the it's like if moreal lead if you're the lead then I guess meeting is like oneon-one but also cra where was it where was dinner this is kind of important um it was it's cheesecake we got to shoot this guy in the head yeah we're going to kill you bro kill you bro it was like a Soho House type VI okay so yeah there was definitely a level of I'm flaunting you know try to trying to it was just the director and I mean it wasn't like fully go yeah it was just the director and it wasn't fully ghost after it just kind of like got weird after it was like WD it was like yeah we're really trying and then kind of fizzled apart was that your first like I was that the first time something like that kind of fell into your lap and you're like like oh I'll see what this is about um yeah I think it really was the first time yeah cuz that was before I was even a full-time streamer yeah man that sucks too cuz like you said like you're a small streamer or whatever you like try to like sure this could be a cool opportunity and then he's just like Netflix we're going to pitch it to Netflix yeah you know the the usual and in hindsight I'm like were they really trying to do this thing or know were they just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] around things die uh there was there was that one show with low TI your God on it but that was a reality show you got voted off yeah on TV it's crazy uh before we wrap this up I'll steal his favorite question and ask please in your career what are you the most proud of that you've done or worked on um I think I am the most proud of it's kind of cheesy but honestly just being like the most followed female twitch streamer because it feels like not an achievement just on my own because it's like everybody who's a content creator has really cool goals and achievements and on one hand like numbers are just numbers but on the other hand I can be like oh in a way I kind of pushed how far along female streamers were by achieving a new goal kind of on behalf of all of us yeah which is nice that's cool uh final question have you heard of Brian Silva Silva sounds familiar I don't think you don't think she has I think she's seen a video of his for sure but she must have who is it he's a dancer among many other things well thanks so much for coming on no thanks for coming on it's a passionate one exotic it's not sexual guys he
