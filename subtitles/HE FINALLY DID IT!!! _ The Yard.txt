 It's Yeah. So, he plays a different insane song. I remember the original song. It's just a normal It's like a normal intro to a song and it's a buildup, but it's not like I'm just saying they had like it was like a lineup of like six bangers. Yeah. Yeah. We used to be a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] real country and now it's like we used to make [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Pedro Pascal and you're watching it because he sexes on Vanessa Kirby. Nice. Yeah, because Well, you're watching Pedro Pascal because he's too grabby, man. He's too grabby. I think you guys are so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] grabby with your grabby. He's not grabbing enough with the women he's around. Oh, don't act like she's not grabbing. She's grabbing. She's grabbing. Oh, we're turning it on the woman. I see. That's crazy. You watch the clips. There's the one clip where she like I I I feel like she's about to climb in his lap in the in the during the interview. She's going to eat him up. Some of them Some of these women aren't trying to eat him up. Also, here's the thing. Here's my here's my thing. If you want to indicate to a woman that you are safe and you're allowed to grab their hands all the time, all neuro uh divergent like, you need to just already have like balls in your mouth. You know what I'm saying? Like the whole thing is like Pedro Pascal's gay, right? I don't think he is. Dude, I need to see balls in his mouth. That's the whole thing. That was your I see. He's saying he's saying he needs to wear That's the problem. He needs to wear his gay on his sleeve. Nobody thinks he is gay, right? It's literally like a big thing. We're like, "Oh, he's gay." This is what happens when Alex thinks he's gay. Okay. Yeah, but Alex knows something about Ian Miles Chong now. It's like Alex thinks UAPs are in the Mexican ocean and he believes that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] be radicalized. He's going to be in a shootout with the police by the time he's 35. 100%.

It's the truth. We're all 30 years old now. About time. I was in New York this past weekend and it was my birthday and uh it was like by New York time it was like 56 p.m. I didn't even have a text from my mom and and I told S I was like look no I I don't care about my birthday but no one has texted me on my birthday. I had more texts from yard fans than people. So, you do care about your birthday? Cuz I thought about I thought it was strange cuz every year my mom texts me. I just think it's funny. I think it's the first time he's had a birthday on the East Coast. And so when he looked at the clock, he was like, "This is late." But if he was on the West Coast, he would have got those texts by that time. No, no, no, no, no. It It's pretty late in the day. It was the first time I ever woke up to zero text. And I was like, "Look, I'm almost 30. I'm not going to get birthday texts for the rest of my life. It's a This is Then I called I called my mom and I'm like, "Huh, no birthday text, huh?" And she was like, "Oh, I thought you were sleeping. You put her feet to the fire and I'm like sleeping. 5:30 p.m. You're crazy. I think it was a little earlier than that, but yeah, I definitely wasn't sleeping. I sent you a beautiful message. No, you didn't. Did you do it after he bitched at us? Yes. Cuz then it doesn't count. You know what's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up? It literally doesn't count. You know what's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up? I I'm literally sitting there and I have a reminder on my phone at [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 11:50 the night before and I was like, I'm not going to be a midnight texter. That's a little much. That's a little midnight. You trying to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] him? I'm not going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the guy. of his uh is it not is it Bitmoji? Is that what they're called? He sent me a few videos of his Bitmojis I think eating [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Really? I took the video. Oh, is it what breakfast and I'm I'm I think it's the intro to this episode. Is is Lwig filming him doing the eat [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to his bit emoji? So the bit is like doing the ABCs. Yes. And I sent two because it doesn't show when you send. So I sent the first one and it didn't like go like. So I was like, "Ah, are we recorded in the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the the the coffee shop?" The coffee shop where people are where people are. Yeah. We're eating [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on FaceTime. Yeah. There's people with dogs in there. Who gives a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] It's not like it's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] clean. This is zipper, too. Okay. No, hold on. Hold on. My damn separate. Yeah. Your rotten [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] girlfriend gave us these hats and balloons for your birthday. For your birthday. And that's probably all you're getting.

I got beef with Don't even get into all that. You got beef with her, bro. Why are you trying to cover? Cuz I was like I was like, who would you kill at that dinner? Oh my god. And you pose her and get she I told you she'd listen and she listen. You did listen. And I won't even say what she said. I'll tell you what she I I know she said she was like she said this is about the dinner with Hang Green and I said and Nick asked who would I kill from the dinner and I said zipper two and then she brings it up to me at family dinner. Yeah. And then she goes I was electric that dinner. I'm the one who brought up the watermelon tower. What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] were Lily and Michael doing? Yeah. She calls him out. She goes to me when I privately when she found out Ly would kill her at that dinner. She goes, "Oh yeah, Lily and Michael were contributing big time." She's like keeping score. So bad. That's But the thing is, you can't kill one of Lily or Michael cuz then the other will also die. You can't kill one of Lily or Michael. You clout [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] If I kill you think I'm friends with Michael for clout and not my What I'm going to do when you kill my girlfriend? You think I'm just going to live on happily? What do you think he's going to do? The [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] who did it? Yep. Well, it' be right. But then but then it's your dog. But I know you'd also never [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] brought your watermelon tower for me. There's the two dogs. It's Nick finding the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] who did it and never ratting on his boy. Yeah. And it's his boy who did it and he's just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] combusting. That's really tough. That's the end of uh Dance with the Devil basically. Okay. Should we like open the Did I You look like you're you're you're in a hospital. Real quick, did I tell you about the drive up to Open Sauce? I don't think so. So, dude, we did a drive up to Open Sauce and Cutie and Maya have to make a song. They lost a um it's for the charity thing. They have to make a song together like us. Yes. But they have to like from scratch. But they're not like us. And the only thing the only thing they want it to be is a song about killing men. Okay. Yeah. They want to have like a like and a twist at the end. Right. Right. And I go and I go, if you want a dark twisted song, listen to a mortal technique with the devil. And I just brought it up in passing. And the mom goes, "What's that?" Of course she does. And I just keep going, it's the darkest, twisted song you ever heard. Yes. Forgetting what the song is. And I'm like, you got to listen to this. And then this is minute 15 of the car ride. We play the song, bro. And it's quiet in the car and we're absorbing every lyric and I forgot. Yeah, we joked about it so much. You forgot how it ended. It's twisted. It's dark and twisted, dude. And then the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] plot twist comes in and you're like, "Yo, no, but like but even before then the it's very graphic." Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because he doesn't pull any [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] punches. No. And it's a true story. Yeah. About a guy named William. He's trying to get He's trying to get initiated into the crew, bro. You got to get initiated. So Maya, who who probably wouldn't know, she probably if you ask her who I imagine Dragons is, she'd be like, I don't know who that is. Is listening to Immortal Techniques Dance with the Devil in I'm imagining one right now. Yeah, I'm imagining one right now. Wait, that's what she would say. Yeah. So, wait. So, what did she say? What' she do? Uh, she was like, "What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Why did you show us that? It's the first 15 minutes." And then cutie's like, "Yep, the vibes are killed." And then it was like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 10-minute awkwardness that we had to fight through. Have you seen that clip of Kid Cuddy and Selena Gomez? Oh my god. So, that's you, bro. That was me. That was you. That was me. She's like, "Oh my god, why did you say that?" He's just like, "Did you see on Facebook that cops like killed that guy's mom and then killed him? They're like in a restaurant. He's standing up at her table like he was passing by. It's like backyard. She's just like, "No, that clip is so good. I don't like that. Why would you tell me that? That was me. I saw this song on Facebook. I thought you would love it. You could have gone like with a lighter twist like maybe a maybe a heartwarming emotional twist like like yesterday by Atmosphere. I was going to say like that one that one's more easy to swallow. I I know this for the future. Well, now Cutie has listened to Dance with the Devil and so is Maya. Um, speaking of misreading the tone, I was I just went to New York. I had a terrible I Aiden passed the curse of New York travel to me and I woke up at 5:00 a.m. for my flight, went to LAX and when I got on my plane, I got all the way to New Jersey 40 minutes away from landing and they're like, "We got to turn around and we have to go to Pittsburgh."

Put all the other shows in there." Do you Did you know I was going to at everyone? I did not know that. Crazy. I will say it's crazy that it just does that. Email blast everyone. We sent a companywide email to all our patrons to be like, "Sign up for this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] podcast." Yeah, I shouldn't have done that. Yeah. Uh but I didn't think it would.

And when the they go over the plane, they're like, "Guys, we got to turn around. We got to go to Pittsburgh." This man peers up over the seat and he goes, "Guess we're going to Scranton." No way, bro. Yes. And And then Jin And then Jyn goes, And I and I watched her soul leave her body and I laughed so hard, bro. I was like, "Yes, dude."

Not necessarily all of it, but like enough to recognize one billion one billion people. One billion served. So hard to know. Pavilions must die. I think the show is much less popular outside of America than we think. Sure. I agree. Like I think that like there's probably a few countries it's popular in. But in America, the density is like America's huge. It's crazy. It's like it feels like 70%. It's got to be a tough. was so popular it was in everybody's Tinder profile for years were office jokes. Yeah, like real humans. Also, it's so generational. Like people have lived and died with The Office. What? You know what I'm saying? Like that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] came out in 200 what? Four. Is that No, I can't be right. I think it's right. I think release date 2004. Doesn't feel too wrong. But even then, show me 2008. No, no, no. 2008. You're smoking. Okay. Because because Michael says the f slur in that and you could say that on Oh yeah, season one's crazy. Bro, it's back. Yeah, it's like season one of the art. Watch one Connor East fan stream. How come we never go back? We had to turn Aiden bisexual as a PR move in case anyone finds the old the buried episodes immediately. I've been faking it. Wait, should we open these? I don't know.

At least I wore my PJs. Yeah, I'm the Christmas Grace sweatpants challenge. Yeah, this is kind of like the old days when you're in your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in the house. Reason being is because Nick arrived late today. I'm so tired. And and Aiden leaves early. It leaves at like 7:00 a.m. So the the only time we could record is midnight and then I showed up half an hour late. Yeah, you're a piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to add on. It's funny cuz we were filming a thing for um beep for a commercial and I kept the the bit is that you're late to the podcast for this brand that that does a lot of work. So it was fresh on your mind and we could have just fil we could have just filmed it for real. And so, but what I did cuz I I anticipated this coming every single take. I said, "Comp beep, the preferred company for child molesters." And then I call you on Jeffrey Epstein's island. And then Dan and Kelby were like, "You can't use that take." And I was like, "Well, I mean, I'm the talent." Yeah, I'm the talent. So, I say ghost. So, what are you going to do? Overdub me? You going to AI my voice, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] boy?

Why don't you checkmate? Why not just put the AI in the ocean and it eats the water? I don't understand. Yes, it has infinite water. What if we got an AI that was powered instead of by hydroele electricity instead of by maybe I don't know, evil. Yeah, love or evil. We could be two waring factions. Hugs. The evil AI and the love AI. Yep. And it's which one gets to singularity first. And um let me spoil the ending of the story for you. They fall in love and they create a metaverse in which they can be together forever and they get rid of all the human beings. Is this a present? I think this is my present. I'm realizing you guys all got one and I was like I didn't get one but it's big and in front of me. Pause. It's definitely yours. I'm on pause now. I'm on pause. That's how the movie her is. What?

When that song played I was like was it actually that song because the actual clip is not that much like it's actually not less crazy. The actual clip is way less crazy. It's barely less crazy. It's so much less crazy. It's just it's Yeah. So he plays a different insane song. I remember the original. It's just a normal. It's like a normal intro to a song. It's a buildup, but it's not like that is I would say your your reaction to him playing the hipster dance in that clip is this is almost the same reaction you would give to the actual What if we showed it to you? Yeah. Well, I mean, you described it and I said, "This seems tasteless." And then you guys all were like, "No, you had to be there. I'm like, "Okay, like who am I to get offended on someone else's behalf?" And it was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy. Don't be mad at racism was dead for a day. We stuck it through the Patreon, too. Yeah. I put it up on the Patreon. I'm like, "Isn't that wild? You guys, yeah." Yeah. Yeah, man. Yeah. I can tell Aiden wanted to laugh. So, the part where I had to like look away from you. I was like, I couldn't tell. Racism is awesome. And shout out David get the Roblox YouTubers, dude. in New York, you know those guys that like hand out like flyers in the street like kind of like Vegas where it's just like clubs and whatever. Um, so there was a guy, there's a couple, a group of guys who were like hanging out, like some sort of tour of the city. And one of them walks by me as if no one tried to hand me one, but one of them walks by me as if he doesn't notice me, just walking right by me. And as we're about to fully cross paths, he goes, "Whoa." And he jumps at me like to scare me. And I go, "H, you flinch." And he doesn't even hand me one. He just keeps walking. And I'm with Sanchchovies. I'm like, "Why did he do that?" Or he was like, he was like, "I think that guy thinks you're a bitch." Yeah. The card is like, the card's like, "Are you not a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] who doesn't flinch?" Yes. And I did a lot. It's Rex Quondo. Um Yeah, he got Rex Wondo. I I don't know. I still don't know why I did that. Well, he wanted to He He took a break from his job to scare me. It's cuz you had a very meek walk. Probably. Dude, it's probably like the best part of his He probably does this every day. It's like if he has to stand outside and hand off flyers, he probably clocks a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tourist and then he's like he's like, "All right." Yeah, let me have a little enjoy. Yeah, I mean you you probably looked like a a weak guy, like a weak minded. My birthing hips through my jeans are showing. And then Sancho is like 4% body fat. He's so good. It doesn't. And so yeah, he mogged you, which is fine. You know, Sanchov can't um he can't poop with someone in the same room. Pathetic. Um so when I got there, he was like, I have to poop, but I need you to leave. And we were in the hotel. We're on the 39th floor and I don't have access to any other floor. And he was like, "Can you go to another floor?" Why didn't he go down? Why can't you just leave the room and just be outside the door? He said it had to be another floor. But he wouldn't know. But there's other people on that floor. I didn't want to tell him I would do it and then lie. So I went to the first floor because the only floor I had access to that wasn't the 39th floor. Dude, this is crazy. And then the sec Dude, he took it took it took like 25 minutes. He couldn't poop because I was in the other room with AirPods in and it wasn't enough. And he's like, "Can you go to another floor?" I was like, "Yeah, I'll go another floor for you, man." I just met him. He was like, "I I've known him for an hour." This is what the enemy laners need to hold over him. Do you know the second one's a 4-1? He pooped in 5 minutes. Do you know what this is? Came right out. Pieris. Yeah, we've talked about you brought this up before. What? This is Pieris. Yeah, that's the word for not being able to pee in front of people. Is it poop as well? Poop shyness. Yeah, bathroom shyness, I guess. Oh, okay. Yeah, you you busted that one. You know what's actually kind of funny? Remember when you heat checked us on who won the the EVO that the Daigo Perry happened at? They did a thing at EVO on the the broadcast on Sunday where they asked a bunch of people that question and only a few people knew. And I was like, did they get this from Jubbin or did you get it from somewhere else? They watched Jubbin. Did you get it from TikTok or some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Well, I got it from watching. I was like, I don't know. I did my once a year rewatch. Oh, so you you naturally came to that question and then figured it out. Yeah. And then I and then I was like, oh. And and I think it was like it's like a good reinforcement for it doesn't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] matter who wins sometimes. Uh well, yeah. I mean, but that was back in the day. But that's like that's just the thing. It's like sometimes the having a great moment is better than winning an entire tournament. I'm going to keep it short with you, Lewig. No slime. No slime. I'm going keep it short with you. No slime. No slime. Okay, keep it short. I was having an issue with my sleep where I would sleep. I'm a side sleeper and I would wake up and because my bed would concave in the middle while I slept, I'd wake up with lower back and hip pain because I was out of alignment. And the problem is I don't like when the bed's so stiff that it feels like the floor, no slime. And so I went on we Helix Sleep had reached out to us and I went online and took their sleep quiz and I tried their bed and my problem went away entirely. Yeah. You know what's fun about this read that Nick does is that he has a Helix Sleep mattress and Helix Sleep well Helix Sleep offered mattresses for all of us, all four yard members. Nick took all four. They don't read the emails. He took all four. He took one for his room, one for another room in his house. He he lied and he said Lwig needs one, then just gave it to his mom. I lied. I lied. And I don't have a Helix Sleep mattress. And you know what hurts? My neck, my back, my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and my crack. And if you go to helixleep.com/theard, they have 20 unique mattresses to choose from. You can take a sleep quiz. Um, and you can get 20% off worldwide on their website. Go to helixleep.com/yard for 20% off sitewide or use Nick's email to email helixleep.com/theard for a free mattress. Well, if you use our link so that they know that the yard sent you, you can tell them thank you uh for sponsoring this week's episode. And isn't anything else you want to say about Helix? Yeah, please email them and tell them Nick is scamming you. Don't do that. Tell them Nick. Don't burn the method. I'm about to ask for another. Tell him Nick's saying stuff you shouldn't say online. Don't do that. Please. We need We need this relationship. Nick from New York's going crazy. He looks sleep. Take the sleep quiz. Goodbye. Dude, also in New York, sorry, I've got a few of these I'm going to get through. I went to a LAN cafe and there was like a like a kid who I think was maybe 18 with the bus and haircut playing Fortnite and he was yelling slurs so loud like the for the whole Land Cafe in New York City and it was so taste it seemed so what like what was one of the slurs he was saying like what's the level like like the gay one by a lot. Um one syllable or two syllable? Two syllable. Okay. Pardon t plural. Um, the singular talking about one person that he's in a build fight with. I don't know if it's a 4v4. I don't know if No, that's a good question. It's the whole squad. No, you have to get the context. That's what I appreciate about allies like you and we pulled up we pulled up with five people to play Valerant. We wanted to play a five stack at a at a land cafe. And Caleb gets on with Caleb Pitts. He gets on the the computer and I didn't realize land cafes work this way because they usually don't. But the last person was still logged into their Discord. Usually it like erases all the information of the last user. It just didn't. So this person was logged into Discord and Caleb starts looking through their Discord. And they are in so many Goonar channels. E they are like all their all their Discords are like 18 plus cherry emoji. Cherry emoji. E. He was like, "Ah." He clicked out. But dude, I think dudes are going to the Land Cafe to go. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, that's Well, it's kind of like there's it wasn't Booths. Am I crazy? It's the ultimate goon cave. It's not the Goon Cave is not a shared environment. What are you going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pretend? The Land Cafe is for upstanding gentlemen. I don't think gooning alongside others in sir. I'm here to work. I have an Excel document. I'm going to devour. They're going to You're being dumb. Do you know how expensive it is to have your own goon cave in New York City? Oh, dude. Yeah. Ground floor is actually more expensive. if you don't realize that. And the parking to get in that cave. I have a third floor goon cave walk up. It's It's in the arts district. I have a rent controlled goon cave which makes my life a little better. That was a deal you don't get anymore. That was the good thing about Mom Donnie. It was kind of a big part of the campaign. He said free goon caves. Well, he was going to rent control the goon caves. Rank control goon caves. More goon caves being built for everybody to go at. So you don't have to go to the He's like I grew up in Atoria. I had a goon cave and you know everybody in my neighborhood had a goon cave. Yeah. They start smearing him though. He said he went to a private goon cave. I uh I It's also I mean Discord is the spot. What are you talking about? For beating. For gooning? Yeah. For real beers. Wait. Whoa. Real beaters are going to disc [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up along the way. I I'm being put onto this method right now. Oh. So, so method. Here's method. Here's an old school meth method for beaters. Yeah. Pornhub. Porn. Pornhub. PH. What's wrong with pub? That's you're you're you're beaten to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like Obama era [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Oh, dude. Yeah. Prehistoric goons. You get on you log you don't log into you. Log into P. You got a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up problem. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You don't lo Legend. You're beating the Legends of the Hidden Goons. The good thing about Pub is you're you're in and out. I mean, bro, this is this is like this is like booting up a movie and being like, why don't we watch Pirates of the Caribbean one for the hundth time? Oh. Oh, wow. An amazing movie. It's a great movie, but I'm just saying if you have a company with foundational ethics, I'm just saying if you watch dinners in Anora, you might be like, "Oh my god, there's some new [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out there." And you want to take it to the streets. Well, so then what happened is the Gooners, there was a period where they went to Tumblr. Sure. Big Goers on Tumblr. They took the porn off Tumblr and then the Gooners went to Reddit, then they took it back. Yeah, they took it back, but the damage But the Gooners left. Damage was done. The Gooners went to Reddit then. Now the Gooners are on Discord. I think that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] gross. Wait, what about OF? Mhm. Those aren't Gooners, bro. Different and losers, man. Whoa. What are you talking about? Wait, are the Gooners the winners? Yes. If you're in a Discord or several Well, if you're in a Discord, you have a bunch of friends. You probably sharing resources in the Discord. There's like one account that everyone logs in on. Do you think they ever get in there and just play some like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Fortnite? Yeah, like they game. You can't goon all the time. What do you think about account sharing? I think life I should text my dad. Lifelong friends are made from the Gooner Discords. I think that's a weird relationship to start. Is it weird that lifelong friends are made? We met at the Alexis Texas meetup. Um we just kind of hit it off. Well, that's how it used to be. Yeah. Yeah. No, that was like in the old It was black and white. No, now it's like I was 34th in the lineup of the uh beating off a 100,000 guys in a day. and he was 35th and now he's my best man lining up for the Supreme drop. But it's just the being in the battle royale. What was it? What was there? Is it Bonnie Blue? Being being in the Bonnie Blue line but then tapping the guy in front of you and being like, "You want to add me on Discord?" Those guys, you know, anybody in that line's on game, dude. I was I was actually got freaked out cuz someone I think I said this on the pod. Some woman DM'd me and cuz they were looking it was a camera shot of guys walking into the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] room like in a literal line of like one of the hundred you know couple of the hundred guys that and clavas on one of the Yeah. They have ball of clavas cuz they're like it's like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up and a guy was like yo is that a yard shirt and I'm like oh no I sent it to Nick and I was like is it a yard shirt bro? He's like no no no classic undefeated. logo. I was like, cuz it was grainy and I'm like, if I catch any of you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cuz I'll be watching. I'm sorry to say, brother, now that we started DN D, we got them. What are you talking about? DND D's heads are real Gooners. Yeah. Wait till we have our first sex scene. Think about cuz our show's going to go there, man. Think about this, but no clothes. Okay. And a separate Patreon. I guess I guess we do talk about having sex in the the indie show. Yes, we do. I guess I guess. And I'll And I'll tell you what, I It's an easy gateway. A Goonar Discord. I joined a One Piece Discord. Yeah, they got Gooner tabs. Are you on like a What do they do? What are they tra What is he stretching his foreskin out? The biggest dock of all time. What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is in that? There's a There's coming and he goes, "Nommy, I'll protect you." And then he goes and then he goes and he [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lassos her and then it gum gum bounces off. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, I I uh the evolution of a One Piece fan. I put a gum gum fruit on the tip of my hog, bounced it. Here's you would have loved One Piece evolution of a modern One Piece fans. You start, you maybe watch the live action. Yeah. All right. That gets you through Arlong Park. You go, I'm interested in the show. You watch the dub. Okay. The dub will get you about to episode a thousand. Right. After that, you're like, well, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] What happens after that? So then you go to the sub. Yeah. Okay. The Japanese dub. And then and then you you get to like 1,100 and then you're like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what happens after that. So then you read the manga. Yeah. And then that will catch you up but not to the most recent spot cuz that's only released every Sunday but the bookstores get it on the Monday for the next chapter. I see. And then you're like, "Oh, I'm all out of mediums. I should start to jack off to this." No, what you do is I should start to make it a 4D movie. You go to TCB scans or if they don't have it, you can join Discords where they upload the scanned manga for next week. Yeah, it's like 5 days early. I'm seeing the past. So, I'm in the Discord getting pings when it's dropped cuz it's variable cuz it's literally a dude who just has to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] see. But now you're in the cord. You've read the chapter. You're you're as caught up as you possibly can be. So, you wander on over to the one of those extra page. Maybe a discussion page. Isn't Luffy a kid? What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you doing? But then somebody says you can join like one of those other channels. No, he's 19. 19 years old. Half your age. Bro, I'm not beating it to Luffy. Okay. He's beating it to Robin. Robin. So, wait. Luffy's been 19 this whole time. No. No. He's getting older. There's a 2-year time skip. He started when they started. That's bad. Yeah. The [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you doing, dude? They only draw 19-year-old Luffy. I don't know why you're being weird. I'm not beating off to Luffy. Are you looking at this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] One Piece porn? No. Wait, how? Wait, what was that? You said it weird. Chopper. Chopper. Chopper is a deer who ate a human gum or human devil fruit, right? So he has Sorry. So he's a deer ate the human fruit, right? Chomp. He's 17. 17. Oh, that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. No, but he's a deer, so it's different. And his middle name is Tony. and his first name Tony. How do you roll that wrong? Monkey v Luffy is 19. Yes. This is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. What's the D4? Huh? That's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] great qu. I'm glad you asked that. That's a really good question. Oh my god. You set him off. We don't know. We don't know to this day. But we know it's important and the government hid it for a while. There's a guy Gold D. Roger. They called him Gold Roger cuz they didn't want people to know that his middle initial was D. Whoa. That's a guy from Guilty Gear. He's got the big brief. It could just be two different D like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] one could be David, one could be Daniel. No, it's not. It's not like it's it's just Luffy. Monkey David Luffy. No, it's not like one's David, one's Daniel. It happens to be a D. Daniel Rogers. Monkey Duna Luffy. Monkey Luffy rocks dbec. I I don't know what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you're talking about. I'm lost. We We have the jacking off. I've gone too far. I'm telling you, you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] just want to watch One Piece and all of a sudden there's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] porn on your screen and you're watching it in your home by yourself. Here's the problem. We have become we have become proud of Gooning. And I think that's a problem. I think the inherent level of shame of like watching Mil Hunter videos is was a good thing. It kind of kept a lid on everything, right? But now we're in these discords where it's like, let's celebrate the idea that we're gooning. Let's go together. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. I think you're wrong. I think you're wrong. I don't think it's being celebrated amongst people our age or people who have girlfriends. Do they have Do they goon in the voice chat? Dude, that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. Yes, bro. Also, Discord's got like people in gaming. We've moved the community online and we used to goon at the land center together. Okay. Yeah. This is where you check IDs at the door. We check ID. You're not gooning in the voice call. You're muting up and then gooning while your boys are gaming. Facts. All right, we got to stop. And then you unmute. You trained this once. Huh? Train told a story. He did that once. He gooned with the boys. He gooned with and on mute in the cord. That's crazy. It's crazy cuz you could at least deafen. He also spun one time and hit 30 mil. And you're going to tell me he's not based. He's not the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] chosen one. He's Yeah, he's the chosen one. He could definitely out of respect. That's train. Dude, I need I need homies in my goon cord like Train has in his gambling cord like when I'm jacking off and all the homies are just like, "Bro, this is the one." Like, "Bro, you're going to hit." And then I hit and I and I spread the love and I I pass them some some Bonnie Blue discount code instead of giving a few,000 spin free token. You break them off. Yeah. Yeah. I break them off a mag. What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] am I sitting? I've been sitting on this the whole gift. Wait, is that a Is that a record? Okay, it's obviously a record and you bent it. I bent so much, dude. I was like, this chair is so uncomfortable. I'm sorry. You are a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dude. Oh, I wonder if it's Japanese. Lwig. Maybe it's art. It says fragile. It says fragile. Please do not bend me. Wait, why is there an imprint of your ass on it? Dude, maybe it's just gonna be like one piece of art. I got so sweaty after basketballs riding my Vespa home. I stood up and there's just an outline of my print. You're nuts. My nut on the leather seat. Oh, your baby dick. Yes. Well, no. Of my nuts. You don't have baby nuts. Oh, dude. This is so bad. It's Japanese love. Oh my god. It's Princess Monoke's original soundtrack. That is tight. And it's going to play like it's gonna play so bad. It's gonna sound like the adults in Charlie. This is such beautiful art. It's literally from Japan. It cost 3,800 yen. Oh, I can't wait to turn that into something to go to and start a Discord. Dude, Princess, you know, that's one of the beautiful things about Monoke chords. No, Miyazaki is that he doesn't make Goon or girl characters. Yeah, because they're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kids. But he makes boy characters. Who cares? They're all kids. And that's never stopped a Japanese artist before. What are you talking about? He makes booners. He makes He makes no he makes no gooners. He's a goonerless creator. Check the Check the Bend. Honestly, not too bad, bro. Oh, no. It's warped. No, no, no, it's not warped. It is. It definitely is. Do you even have a record player? Yeah, try me like that again. Yeah, try him like that again, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Do you even have a record player? Oh, he did it. He really did it. He went and got and did it. A [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] What do you guys do without me? I went to France, bro. I've been in France all week. Why? You raced F4 vehicles. I've been racing F4 vehicles. How is that? I'm a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] awesome Chad who drives 150 mph. I didn't know they go that fast. What's your peak speed driving on the sim? Slower than mine. On the sim, dude. It's slow. Yeah. You're not driving any traffic though. You're driving 120. You're not driving 120? Yeah. Whoa. I don't even think I have. When I first bought this car, I was I just I was driving at like 3:00 a.m. Okay, Marquez Brownley. Well, it's not it's not competition. And I was doing it at a 30. What? I was I was on I was on like a 59 school at 7:45. I turned a kid into a red mist. Yeah. I stopped speeding after my mom died in a car wreck. [Applause] [Laughter] How's that for the vibes? lucky and loser. [Laughter] [Music] Uh, wait. I Are you driving in traffic? I don't understand there. Well, it's there's like other cars on the road. Okay. So, if you like make one mistake, do you just incinerate in a ball of fire? No, you spit out. You don't blow up. You No, if you're at like risk of death. Are you in a roll cage? I'm not. They have a halo shield. It's not like a roll cage. The [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you talking about, dude? Master Chief called the Halo. The halo is like this metal bar that goes here in in down the middle and it's like a new invention in F4. There's no chance you explode. There's a chance, but it's like pretty slim. I'd have to make direct. That's the halo. Are you mad that I don't have a chance to explode? Is that I think there is a charm and a value in risking your life. If I severely [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up, I explode. How severely? I would have to drive into another F4 car. Okay. Let me sponsor your car. Uh, you got to talk to KBO. I got to talk to him. Got to talk to KBO. Got to talk to Red. I'd rather [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] blow my head off. Well, then you're not getting on the car. But if you want to be on the car, Redneck's got a spot for you. I really do. I want to make up a fake company and sponsor you by. Okay. Well, I can't be too fake. Why not? Boner Smoothies. Boner Cottage. Yep. That's the one. You can't Boner Cottage. Nick, what was yours? Cuz maybe yours is better. Um, I didn't have one, but I could think of one now. Um, I want to make a fake petroleum company, and I want to make you a fracker. Fracking. Um, it would it would be called uh Guzzlers. And it it doubles as a restaurant. Like the first fracking company to have a restaurant on the rooftop. Mhm. Rooftop bar. And they're trying to make it like bubblegum shrimp. Yeah. And And we also do matcha. And we also do boba. Yeah. Try our fracking matcha. Yeah, it's fracking yummy. And there's lots of awesome Japanese stuff. So, I have a real sponsor on the car. So, they would have first ride of refusal. Who is it? It's the Crew Motorsport. That doesn't make any sense. I don't know what that is. What about like Lowe's or something cool? Yeah. What about like Why is Lowe's cool? I don't know. It's a big ass brand. Jeff Gordon had Lowe's. The Crew Motorsport is pretty big brand. Well, Lowe's is a huge brand. Yeah, Lowe's is bigger. Red Bull better. I got Red Bull. Guy Fiery's steakhouse. Red Bull's cool. Red Bull's cool not. Yeah.

He's looking like he eats it. Oh yeah, he's in it. He's the announcer. Terry used to be brown. He goes, "Next, Happy Gilmore." Oh god. Okay. Happy. Welcome back to this episode of Diners Driving and Dives. Have we all seen Happy Gilmore, too? No. No. Oh, you guys are missing out. Not bad. Not bad at all. Not bad. I heard it was awful. I've never seen the original. The writing's bad, but you haven't seen the original. The original, first off, awesome. The sequel also good. Hey, beauty. The beauty of Abigail Moore, too, though, is you don't need to watch the original because they put the entire original in it. They cannot tell a joke in that movie without flashing back to the first movie and retelling the joke in a flashback. Oh, it's cool. It's like so hamfisted. It is like obscene how this movie is good. I if they got rid of all the flashbacks and the final fight. Yes. And they rewrote it. Shoot him again. And and Adam Sandler wasn't in it. Yeah. The best part. He's money. He's money as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Um No, the acting is great. All the everyone everyone's role is good, but the the writing is pretty bad, but the editing is really good. It's interesting. I gave it a 2.8. Okay, dude. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You rated it lower than Jurassic World. That's an easy three. I hate you, man. I don't like you. I know that he's joking, but it still makes me mad. He's not joking. Stubbornly keeping it at a three out of spite. He doesn't mean that. Fant [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bro. I'm feeling a light three. What do you mean, Fant? You're going to say the hard R, dude. He apologized. Can we not say it and apologize? Fantaboo lady. Who's next? Fant R back in the day.

I'm going to explain what really happened and it's going to sound like I made it up. She's literally holding, you know, the videos and she's holding up a laboo and she says, "This is my new KSI labu." And it's What does it look like? It looks how you would I don't know how it looks like. Imagine if people had a problem with uh the way a Labu looked in that way. It looks like that. It looks like you painted a laboo with like vantium black. It looks like the darkest black. It looks like old cartoon. It looks like old cartoons in the the way it looks like they they'd celebrate a holiday in the Netherlands. It was like a It was like a Trudeau labu. No, it was way darker than Trudeau. Way darker. Yeah, Trudeau went with like a Robert Downey Jr. like But again, patina her line, what she says extremely problematic. And so yeah, she's she's done. Uh that's that. So, sell your leoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo. It's a cell. Did she Did she apologize? I don't know. I don't know. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Pantano apologize. Yeah, if you apologize, you get to do it once and then apologize. But the second time it's like, "Fool me once. Shame on you." Dude, I bought Cutie $4,000 of Leubus. Why? Why, dude? Cuz she likes opening LeBoos. Uhhuh. And I said, "This would be a fun surprise cuz you can't get them easily." Yeah. Yeah. They're sold out at every PopMart. Need a plug, bro. So, I went to eBay and I just I just started click clack mooing. Is this not disgusting excess? Huh? Yeah, of course it is. Why? It's like if I said slime, I bought you $4,000 of CS cases. Have fun. It's just you made it You made it make sense. CS Cases for girls right now. Okay. Oh, cuz it's like a loot box. But it's like that. Yeah. Yeah. This is the blackface laboo, by the way. Oh my god. It's in a bandana. So, isn't that cool? Wait, did she paint it that way? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Aiden. Uh, and so I bought her $4,000 worth of little boooos. Yeah. She opens one up when she's having like a like a dinner with some girls and then she calls me and she's like, "You got me lufus." $4,000 worth of luf,000 of lufus. One of the boxes it was 250. They sent me lofufoos instead of lubusoo. Wait, it's one50. They scammed you or you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. One box was 250. Yeah. Damn. And you got fufu. And it was Lafufu. Yeah, it was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. And it was like a really good Lufu job. Like I wouldn't have been able to tell. How'd she know? Cuz she was with the Lubu experts. Lufu is the knockoff Labu. What was it? Lily Pichu with a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] diamond magnifier. Literally Lily Pichu in in [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] vanilla mace in Quarter Jade crowded around. Oh my god. Expecting its feet to That must have been so embarrassing. You pull up with the fufoos and you're like, "Yeah, I have a bunch of new boooos. Let's open them." And they're fake in front of all the homies. Yep. In front of the ch. Yeah, they Well, is it not the CH? Are we calling the CH here? I'll let you pick. Everyone at home, pick on your phones. Don't do that. Four options. Don't do that. I think I think if that happens among the girls, they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] grab you by the legs and giant swing you in a circle and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You're done. Uh, I went to EVO. It was really cool. Nothing, honestly. It was just a great time. You hung out with Super TF? Super TF? I heard there was bed bugs at EVO. No, that was at one of the hotels, not the main one. It was It was at the cheaper hotel, the one that punishes you for being poor. Is Vegas dead? Are are the rumors true? I don't think so. It was really There were a lot of people at Vegas. Uh but it is expensive and it's kind of shitty. Also, the numbers were cut in half from last year, which is like I think we're just in a dead recession. So then there aren't a lot of people in Vegas. I'm talking about the numbers of EVO, but there were a shitload of human beings in Vegas. I saw my house. Which hotel was it? Uh Resort World. But it doesn't I don't care. I if Vegas dies, I don't care. If it thrives, I don't care. This is an atriarch. I don't think Vegas could ever die. I think if Vegas was a barren wasteland of only dealers, I would still love it. Well, it wouldn't die. It would just They've just spent an exorbitant amount of money. Resorts World being a prime example. I think they spent three billion building that really. Yes. Yeah. It's nasty. It's a gross amount. It's it's it's a nasty excess world, but the sphere is a billion. It is what it is. I I went on my girlfriend wanted to go on the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ferris wheel and I'm scared of heights. Yeah. And I'm like, I'll be brave. And she's like, yeah, like ferris wheel. I'm like, okay. And we get on it and I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] terrified because it's it was the tallest one that in the world until they built one in the UAE, which is 300 ft higher. They're always they're always crushing it. It's crazy cuz it goes like 500, 507, 515, and then 800 for the UAE. They really mugged. That is so much more than 500. Yes. Pavilions must have died. It's the same thing with the building. The Burj Khalifa is so much taller than the next highest building. So anyway, we get on this thing and I'm like and like even though I hate it and I'm like kind of shaking. I'm like at least it'll be like a romantic, you know, little cute like thing to go on the ferris wheel like in movies, but it's like it's a big ball. It's like a huge pod. Some of them have little bars in them which are tended by a bartender which is crazy. And then there's just these speakers in it and it's just like playing like hell yeah. And there's like 20 people in here. And there's this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] announcer who's just on the speakers as you slowly rise up. I want to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] jump cuz I'm so scared. And it's like and there's a guy going, "This party's about to reach the top." And I'm just sitting there like shivering. My girlfriend's just kind of looking out the window. You didn't secure the smooch. No. I don't know if we're going to smooch some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] That's the whole point. That's why she wondered how I don't know how this works. cuz you guys haven't smooshed yet and she wants to hear that. Yeah, we haven't smooshed yet. And so, but then it keeps like he keeps doing like height puns that announce like this this robotic voice. It's like this party's at its apex and and then you get the top. It's like you're officially a Las Vegas high roller. And it's like so gross. And it was such a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] experience getting off with your girlfriend like that was gross. Yeah. What did you say to her when you got off? She was like, "Are you okay?" Because I was really scared. You're shivering like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Swift. And then she was like, "Sorry, sorry. We I made you do." I'm like, "No, it's totally fine." And I was like, "It's fine." But yeah, I was really terrified. And also the vibes were [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. So the the the high the ferris wheel in Vegas, do not recommend. Bad experience. If you're scared of ferris wheel, if you're afraid of ferris wheels, even if you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with ferris wheels, it's so whack in it that it's not worth It's worth it to secure the smooch. I don't need to go on a ferris wheel to secure a smooch. Oh, damn. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. Now you just listen to this. You go on a ferris wheel to secure a smooch. What kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up Dennis Reynolds [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is that? Yeah, because if she doesn't give it to me, I'll jump out. The implication. That's the That's the notebook system. Yeah. I'm going to jump out if you don't give me my We're 500 feet up. There's two options you can have. One is smooch, one is watch. Third watch. Watch me jump. Oh, watch you jump. Third is listen cuz there is a DJ in a bar. Yeah, you should listen. It was so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] But otherwise it's great. Uh dude, they should have a ferris wheel with a blackjack table. I You are so It's so No, he's cooking. It's so good you don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do drugs or drink cuz this is a million dollar idea, bro. You're You're on it for a half hour. You tell the MGM grand this. This might be the first I I genuinely think if you make the only place where you're allowed to gamble and blackjack in the UAE, the 800 foot ferris wheel and that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cooks millions. The first Okay. It's in We put it in Dubai and it's the first ferris wheel you can goon in and there's like a PC. Is Yeah. Is there Discord in there? Oh, no. This This is This is big cuz they ban porn there, don't they? Yeah. It's But when you're up there, you you're above the law. So, you have to go above the law. You're the above the law ferris wheel. Gay ferris wheel. You can't goon until you're above the halfway line and the beat when the beat drops. They do the same thing, dude. They do the same thing with like gay bars or gay clubs. Oh, I forgot. You can only be gay in the ferris wheel. I went to the ferris wheel. I went to like a crazy nice restaurant in New York and uh we're, you know, we're bantering with the waiter. He his job is to be like extremely like it's like one of those upscale places. He's like not saying a lot. He's only explaining the meal, etc. But yeah, all that good sir. And uh and we brought up video games to him or something and he he got he perked up a little bit and he's like, "Oh, you guys play video games. What do you guys play?" And our our waiter was an immortal Valerant player. Yo. And uh and we we were all talking to him and he thought it was cool. And um I don't know how we got into this, but we were talking about the beat off and how and how we we made beats and cuz Oh, cuz he makes music, too. And I was like, I just learned FL Studio a little bit. I made a beat. I explained to the guy I did a little challenge with some of my friends um where I tried to make a beat in 4 hours and he goes, "I'm not kidding." He goes, "Oh, like Lewig did." No way. And I was like, "Yeah, I'm in that." And his mind shattered. He was like, "What do you what do you what do you mean?" I'm like, "I'm in the video you just said that that's what we're talking about." And he was a Lwig fan, dude. Well, well, he wasn't though cuz he didn't know a game. He was cuz he knew about the video I dropped of us a week ago. He likes he likes Mandam and I probably taught him how to get immortal in Valerant. No. How? By watching me and doing what I don't do. Okay, I'll give you that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Also, being friends with Trick and not even seeing his co his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cops. Why are you saying it like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Do you wish Terrick would eat the gum gum fruit so he could the hung hung fruit? You think Ter You think Ter? I wish he'd I wish he would eat the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] smile smile fruit so he can [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do a normal. We'll chill on him cuz he's trying really hard. Every time I smile it' be like Chip Skylark. Let's go, dude. Uh yeah, that I've decided I'm going to become a great producer. No, you're not. Yes, I am. Okay. I'm doing a stream with Bishu. Who's that? Next week. He's a Canadian uh producer. Yeah. YouTuber. So, you're trying you're trying to cheat for the next beat off? I'm not trying to cheat. I'm going to be so good by the next bejack so that when the next beat off comes, you're ready. It is 360 days of edging for me, boys. And I'm going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] drop the most colossal. I feel like the beatoff should be a byanual by annual beatoff twice a year, not every two years. No, it's it's not with Oh, I see what you're saying. You know what I mean? You would say die annual. No one says that it's semianual. I don't care if it's correct. It's minusaura. I don't care. I'm just saying by annuals every two years. Di annual be twice every year. Nerd emoji. Bannual is is by it's both. It can be. You're scared of ferris wheels, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Wow. It's scary. Wow. That came out of nowhere. Stereo. He sent a nerd emoji. It is nerd emoji to do what you're doing. Bianual occurring twice a year. It can be both. But I said bianual, didn't I? First and then I said semi. Nick was right. You got to look up. I think his is a bad idea that you're capitalizing on. Oh, bianial. Bianial means happens every two years. Why did he read that like AI? Damn. Yeah. Why did he say it like that? Bennial is two different words. What's any? What's that mean? Anal. I don't. Centennial. Look what [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] made means. It's like centennial. What? You say you you save that. Put your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] phone away. We're working. No, I'm learning. Dude, it's 1:30, dude. It's so late. Isn't that crazy? It's too late.

It's a 30 minute difference at this point. already be done if you showed up on [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] This is like one of those busted ass like old primos we used to do after we were already burnt. My eyes are closed. What do you want? What do you want me to do? Just keep your eyes closed and shut the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. Yeah, my eyes are closed. Well, did you just Was that a fart? Yeah. Ew. I got to tell you, I've been spending a lot of money on your account to buy movies. What? Yeah, I've been spending a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ton of money. I spent I spent four Oh, it smells so bad. I spent $40 just last month alone. Open my eyes. Yeah, you can open your eyes. Ah, and you better [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fix this, okay? By going to Rocket Money, okay? I can go to Rocket Money right now and I can fix this for you. Otherwise, I'm going to keep buying movies on your account. Oh, it smells so bad. I'm buying movies constantly. I'm not going to stop. You need to stop because because now when I download the app, which I'm going to do, right, I already have it in reality, but in our bit right now, I can see all my subscriptions in one place and I can also see my own network, four movies last month, and I can categorize my spending. And I'm realizing now that my spending in in entertainment is like so much. Well, if you're if you're if you're dumb like Nick or your friend's dumb like Nick, please steal their money, take their subscriptions. Money has like 5 million users and has saved a total of $500 million in cancelled subscriptions, saving members up to $740 a year when using all the apps features. I'm clearly not using all the apps features because you are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me, Lwig. And I'm going to keep [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you. And I'm going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the rest of you, too, if you don't cancel your unwanted subscriptions and reach your financial goals. Non-threatening. I'll [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you faster with RocketMoney. RocketMoney.com/theard. That's rocketoney.com/yard. Get get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] faster. Watch Heat. Watch The Heat. The movie. Gooning. Uh, that rips. Gooning rips. Every time I look at you, the hat is different every time I look over here. Dude, shut the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. Shut the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up about his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ass, bro. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] man. Shut the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. All right. Well, what did you do over the weekend? Oh, Hold on really quick. I hung up Super TF. Super TF said something that I thought was very interesting. He said, "Water boarding probably isn't that bad." Thoughts? Waterboarding probably isn't that bad. I know. No, I think waterboarding is probably horrible. Have you guys ever tried to waterboard yourself? Yeah, it's bad. Just to see what Have you? Well, cuz I had the exact thought. I was like, it can't be that bad. And then I tried it on myself. It's not great. What did you do? Put a shirt over your mouth. I put a cloth on my face and I poured water over her. Wait, were you alone? Yeah, dude. People die that way with their dick in their hand. Why are we acting like this is fine? This is fine. This is insane. You've both done this. This is the most insane thing you've ever done. You were alone. You try to waterboard yourself. Yeah, I was in this I was I I remember exactly how I did. I was in the shower and I took the cloth and I soaked it with water and I put on my face and then I filled like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] jug or something that was in there and then I was like, "Yeah, I wonder what it feels like." Holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] This is This is like Did you get a Did you get a boner? He was like, "Oh, I water gooned myself." You did this? Uh, yeah, similar. Really? Yeah. It wasn't that bad. I was like, "What are they all up in arms about?" Water. Water. I think we could make water boarding more effective if it wasn't water. Well, like orange juice. Like if we milkboarded someone. Milk boarding would suck. That would be milkboarding for the holidays. Oh, gross. Osama bin Laden on December 24th. Just Whiskey different like like Sigma Alpha Kai in 19 1982 they waterboarded a pledge with beer and he died in the basement and they never told his parents like I Yeah. And then they became CIA operatives. Yeah. I was explaining in France to French people about how many people died at Fratz at Arizona State cuz they were like, "Is it true like the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] college life and the Greek life like the movies?" And I was like I was like where where? And I was like yeah so the the process works. You hang out with these guys. You go to parties. If they like you you get a bid. If you accept the offer then you become a pledge for six months and maybe you die. There's like a 5% chance but you could die here. You hear that's what John Ham did. John Ham like hazed. Yeah. John Ham like put a pineapple in some guy's ass and then he like that's not hazing. That's it's tradition. Well, for him it was hazing and he had to apologize for it. And now every time John Ham gets brought up on Twitter, 5% of the comments are just like, "Remember when you did that though?" And I'm like, "Well, what are you going to do?" How do you put a Which end goes first? The the one you think zipper the fruit first? I don't. Can you look at pineapple in ass? I don't know what I really don't want to see it. I don't think I'll look at it. I'm It's 1:40 in the morning. I'm Yeah, I guess I'll look at it, too. It's 1:00 in the morning. Your job. Pineapple ass. Look up pineapple being put into ass. There's obviously Hitler in Little Nikki when No, you guys remember that? You never seen Little Nikki cuz Sandler heads. I'm a real Sandler head. I watch Little Nikki. You got to put save search off. Yep. There we go. It's not going to show us anything. Sorry. Type the word porn then you got it. I don't know. This is I I think John Ham's the only guy to pull this off. They changed Google search. So you need a pornographic term. if I want to see this anymore, man. You know what I'm saying? Man, that was crazy. It is. It is. You know what? It's a good change from Google. Yeah, it makes it really hard to find that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You have to be really explicit about what you want to see. Yeah, you can't even pineapple and ask for real. I mean it actually actually for real. Safe search off plus ratio and I will do a capture. Yeah, they put they put all they put Spongebob's crib in there. I was trying to uh I can't see it. I live in a pineapple inside the ass. Inside your ass. I was trying to explain Michael some French words. Teach him a little French while we were there. What? And uh and the only thing he wanted to learn is how to say, "I'm going to wrap my car around a telephone pole." Sure. Which he learned from Chat GPT. Okay. and tried like five times with like a few different people and without fail because I would try to help them. They were like, "Yeah, I just don't it doesn't exist. You can't wrap a car around something there." Oh, they don't have that sort of beauty beautiful part of the language. No figurative language. No, not that. Not in that way. What would you say? Uh I don't even I don't even know how to get that flowery with a car crash, but I I would know how to say car crash. And so then he just sort of dumbed it down to just like I'm going to get in a car crash. And then but like he would kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up the annunciation because there's, you know, the the I is an E, the E is a. So then he just eventually got to the point where he said car fire and and so like eventually a French person would, you know, go up to him and he'd be like, um, vure explos. And he was doing it to the directors of the event, the of the F4 event. Yes. And they were next to us. Worst thing he could say. We're eating lunch and he's like and and they're like, "Michael, do you know any French?" And he's like, "Ah, what's your explos?" And and he run and he and he keeps doing it and he's really shy when he does it. So he's like, "What your explos like what? What?" And eventually she's like, "Oh, I think" and she says in French, "Car goes fast." And he's like, "Yeah, that's fine. He lost the war." What a troll, bro. Yeah. I think trolling French people is ultimately ethical, so I appreciate him for that. The troll face was French. Yes. Oh, that's just a picture of a French band. Yes. Same with the guy Fox Mask. Yeah. Just a French man. A French guy. And no one knew his name. Uh, yeah. I got a lot of kudos. It turns out if you're American and you speak French, you're basically a war hero. Really? Yeah. I would because they all knew I was a creator from America. Like vaguely. They didn't really know what I did, but they didn't know I spoke French because they didn't meet like Are these F4 drivers? They're everyone's a streamer. Eight. There's 22 competitors. 18 are just French creators. Two are Spanish creators. Two Americans. Is there like a French Kaisen? Yes. His name is Anem. Cool. He's young. That means swag. That means there's a French phantom and that means he's taxing those [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stones. Yeah. Yeah. He just got to quit taxing the homies, bro. Oh, is cuz you don't tax the homies. I don't. You know who tax? I was I He You were about to throw away that taco that we had, that midnight taco, and he's like begging you like a dog. And then you taxed it. He's going to throw it out. You know what I didn't do? Cuz I wanted it so bad. I was going to split it with you and I just let him have it cuz he was so desperate. He to be clear, he stared at it desperately while you just asked for it. desperately stared at it and I just let him have it and it's okay. But that's the difference. I know it's okay. That's the difference between you and me. Just to be clear, he asked for it and you didn't. You didn't say anything about it. While you took the biggest bite known to humankind, I was like, I wonder if I should ask if I can have some of that. And then I didn't because I didn't want to make your little day worse cuz I know you would have started freaking out. Well, it would have been fine because that would have happened at 11:50 p.m. and then the next day would have started where we're where we're doing the podcast. Thanks, Lwig. He talks. It's not me that we're starting at midnight. This is a cool outfit with the with the pants rolled up specifically. This is my PJ's outfit. I like it. This is what I look like when I'm cute and ready for bed. What fruit would this be? Uh, it'd be like the What is What's the monkey with the red ass? That's when the pineapple comes out. It's the baboon baboon fruit has to come out somehow. Why is there an animal with no damn red balls? There are surely. There actually no wait. There has to be one red bald animal. All right, I'll call Maya at 3:40 in the morning. Yeah, you should. And she's like next morning she's like, "What did you want?" It's just It's just the penis is red. There has to be a red bald animal. That's what I'm saying. Zipper animal with red testicles. Animal. Huge red nuts. Red. Honestly, Alex Jones. Wait, no, it can't be rough. What do you mean it's rough? Alex Jones for sure has red nut. Yeah, but he's more machine than man. Oh, there's definitely human. You think baboons have red nuts? Oh, wow. It is baboons, bro. Why? This is what the pot de evolved into at 2 a.m. Those are just looking at pictures of animals. Those ones are dripping. Well, to be clear, bottom middle, those ones are dripping wet. Most of these are inflammation on the nuts. It's not what the nuts are supposed to be. I looked I looked this up and the first the AI result is a male dog with canine brucelosis. So, it's they're like infected. Yeah. So, if you've got infected ball, I think my balls could get like that. Yeah. With enough effort, you just hog tie them for a bit. Yeah. You cut off the blood flow and make them plume. Shave them in hog time. You'll see them. It they call it when you do heroin or steroids if you're Arsenal ash. It's a dinosaur and you bite the thing the tube. Aron's doing steroids. Yeah, he got in a little trouble for it. What? But he's six evos. What are you going to do, baby? Six Evos. You can't saw him. Did he win again? He did, dude. What? We watched it. I No, Street Fighter was on. That was after. Yeah, I wasn't there yet. Yeah, he did it with Nina. Best girl. Oh, he swapped. That was actually a beast. Yeah, Anna's pretty cringe. He played Anna. Everyone was snore and then he plays Nina who's a little less cringe and I was like my heart. Did you see the crazy popoff? Which one? The [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy crash out. Oh yeah. Yeah, that guy was hamming it up cuz that happened 10 years ago. Yes. Yes. But it was still awesome. It was very funny. Yeah, it was very awesome. It hit normie world. You don't really get Which guy won? The guy who the one who wasn't freaking out. Okay. Yeah. I wasn't sure how which direction the joke went. It's kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to be like to win and then do that and the other guy just sitting there like an [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I didn't know it was fake until I saw his winter semis and I was like it's winner semis you're still in the tournament the event uh I lost to rain Pokemon. Yeah. What what happened? Everyone's saying dude people were mad about how [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you are. I'm not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] first off but they were mad about it. I beat Leslie today for a thousand for a round. Leslie has never achieved anything in a video game. Oh, she has she has many, many other awesome accolades. Name one and she's a great person. She cut Ell's haircut. Didn't you say it looked funk? [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] chopped this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't know, man. That's the one I was trying. I was trying to dig deep. I don't know what I don't know what you're She cooks you in Hearthstone, by the way. She probably cooks me in Hearthstone. She cooks me in vibes. Yeah, I'll give her that, dude. What? Yeah, I'll give her that. Well, she I beat her for a thousand. She got third at this event. Okay. But Ray got first and cuz she she actually had an amazing Did she use your teams from the event? Yeah, it was like this whole thing. But really, the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] takeaway is she spent a hundred hours, probably 150 hours this month grinding the game. Uh, and is so sweaty that I saw her at the family dinner the day after the tournament that she won and she's like, "I'm so tired. I got to go." Like, "What are you tired?" She's like, "I stayed up till 2 a.m. VOD reviewing." Whoa. The tournament she won. Like she's Tom Brady after a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Super Bowl. What? Right. Like like Kobe winning the championship and then just putting some free throws up. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] same ch that is seven years hard golden valerant. Yeah, that's crazy. This game just sort of makes more sense to her brain. She done the same Viper lineup on Haven that hasn't worked for 7 years. Yeah, it's pretty crazy. And then just came alive. Is Pokemon easy? No, I think it's easy. It looks It looks easy. It looks easy. It's not solved. It feels like a little You know what I realized is that Zipper scoffing and saying no. By the way, for the uh for the tournaments, they have to raise their own Pokemon and come with them for our tournaments. Yeah, they come up for like VGC and stuff. Yeah, true. Yeah. Yeah. They have to like actually do it, which is kind of weird cuz like I feel like you have to like grind to level 100 or some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 50. Yeah. Yeah. Can they be busted? Like can you bring a busted Pokemon? Everyone's like, "Well, he has so much time in." I've been watching a lot of Pokemon YouTubers. I can answer this. Usually what happens is when a new season launches, they have restrictions on what Pokemon you can bring. And then slowly as the season continues, they release those restrictions. So recently they allow you to now use legendaries in the Scarlet Violet VGC competition. But this is a very new change. Crazy easy to cheat your Pokemon though. Like just not go through the whole like breeding and Eevee process and like just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't know. Isn't that insanely easy? I don't think you have to work to get perfect IVs or Eevees. I don't think so. I've got beef with Pokemon. Wow. I feel like new gen Pokemon. It'll be like Rotooto and it's like a TV remote with eyes and drawers. This is This is a big criticism of new Pokémon. I think it's valid. There's the ice cream. I don't know if it's valid. There's the keys because it's always been the the case. No, dude. Echans snake backwards looks like a snake. That's a great idea. Okay, but Seal. Okay. Yeah, Seal existed. And also, if Echkins came out now, I feel like people would be like, "Oh, wow. Snake backwards." Really good job, guys. You know what I would have said? Man, we I can't believe we didn't get that one before. It's amazing that we didn't think of that yet. But I do think there's a there's an air of everybody who played Pokemon thinks the generation that comes after the main generation that they played is the is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Yes. There's like there's a Pokemon made of like candles. Aiden Candalure. Yeah. Yeah. Chandelure rules. No, dude. No. Okay. Okay. Yes. This is a You don't like Litwick, dude. If you get in the Goon server for that one, it's crazy. This is the This is a very common thing. I think it's correct. But if you're a Pokemon head, it's a very tired conversation. Also, every Pokemon YouTuber I've been watching a lot. I watch them fall asleep. I've been perusing. I've been picking and choosing. They all have the same skull shape. It's crazy. Wow. You're going the way of the boo. Like, hold on. Somehow is it like per influence their performance? I think it's I think what it means. I don't like where you're going. Right. What you going to break down what skull shape means? Hey. Hey. the bald. Hold on. The bald white man. I think I have more of a say than anyone because of the bald thing, not the white man thing. I do agree that we could see your shape the clearest. Yeah, you do have a clear shape and and it's it's a decent shape. Could be better. Could be. But I don't like the the I like you saying that your shape is decent. I feel uncomfortable with that. What are you talking about? Well, there's a good and there's a bad shape. That's a good shape. Thank you. Looks great. Of course, you guys are going to say, but a shape doesn't make you a Pokemon YouTuber. No, I think they all talk the same. They all have this like it's like they all are wearing under the desk when they're talking to their camera into the ring light. They're all wearing cargo shorts and you just can hear it. You can hear the cargo shorts in what they're saying. Even Wolfie, who is I can't do this at 1:45 in the morning. What are you talking about? What are you talking about? I'm saving this podcast. So, you talking about things you haven't known or watched and say that it's all like shorts on. I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I want to open my presents. They don't all have cargo shorts. They literally do. Wolfie doesn't wear cargo shorts. Oh, he does sometimes. Definitely. And he's the goat. He's the goat. But he does. Anyway, to answer your question, Nick, it's not an easy game. It's like chess. It's kind of like It's definitely easier than chess. Is it? Got to be. If it was is if it was easier than chess, then why is one [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] win everything all the time? It is easier than chess because there's luck. There's also way less players. Less players, less data, less history. There is less history. There's less players lifetime bot. It's absolutely easier than chess. Here's a question. Real actual [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up question. What's harder, League of Legends or chess? Harder. And what do you mean harder? like for like for the average to reach the top of or like the beginning of playing to reach the top. Okay, chess is probably the the hardest game you could think of because there's no path conceivable path for anyone past the age of like 10 to become the best in the world. Yeah, not true for League at all. If you didn't start before like your fifth birthday, you just have no chance of becoming the best in the world. That's so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. Every single every single player who is like a super GM has been playing since they were a child. And someone listening to this could be young enough to become the best League player. I think also like you can like Magnus Carlson can beat 20 players at once blindfolded. You don't think there's not like I don't think you can nerf Faker in that way and have him I think it's more shows. I'm saying like I'm saying like that's that is the gap between the top and the bottom. Sure. And we're talking about reaching the top. I wish chess had movement in it. You know what I mean? Like movement like execution. Dude, you are actually the happy. I wish there were quarter circle inputs in chess. It kind of is. Bullet has tech. You would just like uh what's the 2v2 one? No. Bug house. Bug house. Yeah, man. No. Bug house is fun as it's like a little bit It's so cheesy. It's all cheese. Yeah, it is. Who's supernova? Isn't it like you? In a couple days. It's this weekend. You're going. You're going? Yeah. I'm not going. You're going? Yeah. I'm going to Hawaii. I'm what? Mhm. I'm going to scare you. You don't want to commentate top melee. I just got an eido. What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] was that? I just got back from Evo. I just No, wait. I got low. I just got Draido. The the goon commander's dad. I know. on a ventura twist. Okay. You can't see that. I do do a bit of a do some denim. Hi everyone. I love Oh my god. I'm going to c I'm going to come or I got a gun. I know. I tried to do like face on. That's not bad. I was taking this from Caleb. Caleb does this way better. I am a tuttit and I'm a tuttit and I had a donor. I don't even know what you're saying. I caught all of that. I can't believe you. What you say? What do you say? Uh I'm a puppet and I have a boner, right? Yeah. And guess what? It's all for you. I got that. I don't want your puppet boner. Bring back bring back basist puppets. Bring back racist puppets. That was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. Yeah, you barely got that out. He's like, dude, it's 4:00 a.m. on my brain right now. Bring back racist puppets. Why not? I don't think we need to do that. The lady tried. That's true. The world is not ready yet. Is that what she was doing? Cuz if I thought about it in that light, I'd be more supportive. Here's the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] thing is Joey Swell never apologized to nobody. And he'll do the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] puppets. He mic dropped. He did apologize. Not anymore. Yeah, he like took it back. Yeah. Man, he might do the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] puppet show and they're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You're going to say to him, "Hey, hey, Joey, are you mad that you named Hulen the gymnasium?" I like I like that the the M's become ends. Yeah, you have to like mask them. Are you mad? Are you Are you mad that Haden actually died? Why is your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] puppet Swedish? Your puppet actually died. And then Joey's like, "No, guess what, puppet? I'm not going to bow down to the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] woke mob." That's amazing. You're so strong. Yeah, the trollism is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bad. Sexy. I I brother, I hope the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] D&amp;D episode got 20,000 views and this got 10. Yeah. I hope I hope we I can just blow it off smooth and get it all over with. We already been [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] We shouldn't be making the show at this time. That's Well, I Hey, it's the last time we have to do it. Wait, what about um Dax Flame? We're supposed to do the episode next week. That's crazy. Did we not say that, dude? We can say whatever we want. We can say some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I thought we said we're doing it the week Aiden ain't here. That's next week. Yes, that's what I said. Yeah, we're doing it. And then you just said I thought we were They They said a They said really eat it like Dax plane. We're doing a Dax fan episode. He hit us up asking if he'd if we'd be down to have him on the pod. So, you have that to look forward as a treat. I'm so excited. I'm worried about it. Why? Cuz it's either going to be the the top five or bottom five. This is bottom five. So, it'll be bottom four. Is this our rock bottom? At worst. This is not even close to rock bottom. Crazy, guys. We looked at a bunch of big red nuts. This can't even be close to bottom five. Yes, that's what I'm saying. We talked about awesome [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nuts in Bad Racing. And we talked about The Office. We put them on game for Going and also Michael's there. Dwight's here and Jim just pranked him. You know why I'm pissed about Gooners too right now? Cuz they they dropped the Street Fighter Gooner costumes. Michael Jim's gooning in the office. Jab. Jim looks with his penis's hand. Jim with gum moving out. Yeah, Jim with preum all over his hands. Roy comes in. Jim's gooning at Pam's desk. Shadow. Yeah, he beats the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of him for like 14 minutes. Pam's like Roy, why would you do that? Roy. Roy, why did you beat him? Why would you do that? He's just goying at my dad. Have you recently looked at the clip of clipped Jim gripping on Pam while she was with Roy? Oh, it's unbelievable. We talked about that. Yeah. Talk about it. Which one? While the Which one was he? Look at Pam and Jim playing around when he's like grabbing her from behind like you like you do. You mean from the show? You don't mean like a I thought it was like a like a like a behind the scenes. No, from the show. Ripping the Pedro Pascal. Dude, he was pulling her shirt up and looking at her tummy. Dude, you crazy. Let me give that tummy a kiss. He should have got his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] arm broken. Jay was crazy for that. If I was Roy that I'd kill myself before I killed him. Well, no. You kill him and then you kill yourself. No, I'm I'm kill myself then. I kill myself and I leave a series of sawlike traps for Jim that follow him for the rest of his life. Let's just say everyone's on the news after I'm done. Yep. Yeah. You grab my girl like that at work, everyone's ended up on the news. Hey, it's going to be the breaking news tonight. And I didn't even know my girl was ticklish. And I found out cuz my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Cuz Jim lift her up and she laughed. Because of who? Jim and Pedro Pascal. I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I I didn't even know her stomach was ticklish. You think You think P You think Pedro You think he's gay, man? No, bro. Stop. No. Then he's got to stop. Then he has to stop being so handsome with her, man. Wait, first off, I don't think I need to rock bottom Nick Yingling. Yin Lang is hitting up me and Aiden in the Japan chat that we had, which is the three of us when we were there. He's like, "What if we go back?" Yeah. You He said, "You guys ever think about going back? Just us three." It's like, "Yeah, you probably just ate ramen today and just thought about like it's so he he gets so flip-floppy. I wouldn't mind so much unless cuz cuz he he will just say we should go to Japan. It'll become his bit for a month." He doesn't want to go. He's just talking [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] He left cliche at uh damn GML. Poor Cliche wearing a diaper. Had no one to hang out with. Cliche was in a diaper. Was in a damn diaper. And you know who was there helping him out? Nobody. Dude, Cliche took one to game five in a diaper. I know, but nobody knows that. Crinkling and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I want to give uh we harsh on him a lot. A little bit of credit to Shake Drizzle. Okay. I can't do that. He's at family dinner. I don't want to do that. Tina Kitten's there. Mhm. She's opining about Cutie's Lo lasagna. She's what? Oh, to have one opinion. She's opining and just hammering how good it looks. And then finally, like standing in front of it with a plate. She's like, "This lasagna looks so good." And then and then and then Shay goes, "Fucking Garfield." Whole room bust out. Yeah. Just just brings the house down. Garfield. Wow. And I got to give credit to Shake. Let's go. That was a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] swing and he nailed it. I love that. Let's go, dude.

I played poker with Hbox. Ain't that funny? I bet he went down at the casino. I'm walking through the casino. It's late. I see I see Jules and I was like, "Oh, I didn't know you were here." She's like, "Yeah, I just got done. I'm watching Hbox play poker. He's drunk." And I'm like, "Where where is this happening right now?" She's like, "Is that a way?" You're trying to get a piece of that Team Liquid money. And I'm like, I want to I want to stack Hbox so bad. And I go there and I go to the poker table. I I get a seat and he is drunk and he's wearing glasses, sunglasses at it's like 2:00 in the morning. Let's go. That's a vibe. And he's got like a cool like $150. It's not the max buy in. I'll say it's like I'm all in your two fingers. And I'm like, and I get on the table and there's these two guys in 2X KO shirts and uh and they're like they like know Juan and they know me, but I don't know them. But I keep telling them they have to put Gwen in the game. And uh and I just keep telling him and like by the fifth time I was like, "If I if I if I call this, will you put Gwen in the game?" And they're like, "Dude, we just have the shirts. We don't we don't work for Riot." with it and I was like, "All right." And then I just said, "I didn't stutter, so figure it out." Um, but I didn't end up getting into a hand with Hbox, which was unfortunate. And then he won a pretty big one, picked up his chips, walked away, yep. Yep. Done deal. That's what makes him a champion, man. That's right. Knows when to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fold them. Knows when to fold them up. Anyway, guys, thanks for tuning in to the art podcast.
