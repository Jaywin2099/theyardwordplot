 Fine, I'd let you get off in this magical world. Is there something to get out of it now? Is there something to get out? These Levis's mom jeans. Damn. H&amp;M or something. Oh, what's that say? My son loves Japanese. What does that say? Uh, yeah. Total fit probably $7,000. Damn. It is. Is it a dumb question to ask why they look like that? I feel like it's not a dumb question. Yeah, that's true, dude. Who's only ever known the Shut Tims? That That's what you're doing. But the Chevy logo is the more interesting part. They put a Chevy logo. It's all interesting. It's I've I I I've seen New Balance is this color, right? All over. New Balance cuz it's just a color. It It is. Show your work. No. Isn't it also the material? Dick. I guess Tim Yeah. Tim's fuzzy. No, he got the fuzzy Tims. I'm just saying they look inspired. She cut my man's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. If I see you from far away, I'm like, "Oh, he's wearing low cut Tims." You were screaming at him. I mean, this is crazy. He's just saying so many crazy things. It's not crazy. Did he look at these shoes and he's like, "These are Tims now." That is crazy. You got mad at him before talking about before. You got mad at him before stormed out while I was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dicing up someone on cuz Lwig had an awesome garden gnome that was gifted to him. And you know how Lwig treats gifts. Oh, it's broken. It's completely shattered. It's broken. Yeah. So, I set it back up back there. First off, take that back. It was delivered to me shattered. I take it back. No, you told me. You just told me you did it. What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] No, I didn't. How am I supposed to trust you? I told you that I put it in here, but the reason it was shattered is cuz it was shipped to me that way. You said it tumbled down the hill. I picked that up. I said, "What happened to this?" He said, "Yeah, I put it on the hill and it tumbled down." Why would you not explain at all that the brokenness is not part of that equation? Cuz I don't see the broken. You look at it and see the brokenness. I looked at it and saw him face down and I thought that was the problem. You saw opportunity. I saw the face down and I saw that's what needs to be fixed. You saw the broken leg and thought that's what needed to be fixed. I don't see the Special Olympics and go I wish this was the Olympics. I go I'm right at home. You You see the Special Olympics and say I can beat that time. The only time is 3v3 basketball and I think maybe are there any sports that aren't in the special Olympics because it's special? Yes. Like what? Which ones aren't steeple chase? Why not? Give them steeple chase. Give them steeple chase. I don't think they have a steeple chase. Do they have curling? Oh. Oh yeah, that's an easy one. I think I think it's the same. You always like to push the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rock. Is that is that that's a that's a what nation is that we like to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rock. It's a Scottish Swedish person. Yeah. Scott they invented it, right? No, no, no. That's a Swedish sport or something. Swedish. It's Nordic, I think. I think the Scottish invented curling. I thought the Canadians The Canadians are too Hey, shut the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. The Canadians didn't invent anything. They're too new to invent literally anything. We can't have anything. What did you guys invent? Nothing. Brown face. Yes. The telephone and the No, you didn't. Hey, Alexander Granbell came. Alexander Graanbell is Canadian. That's crazy. Yeah. And the thing is, you should never challenge a Canadian on what they've built. Didn't he bite that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] No. Yeah. Well, he didn't he bite that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] The dark Well, he moved to America and then he invented it. But let's go. Let's go. Well, he didn't have the tools or the knowledge. He needed to come here to the land of the free, the home of the brave. When When did that drop? When do you think that dropped? The phone. The phone. 1891. I feel like that's a great guess. It sounds good. It's not the 1900s. I know that. Yeah. And it's not the 1700. 1889. So now we're just Okay, we're close. Okay. 1885. I would have gone like 1866. That's the dumbest [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you've ever said. Actually, that's pretty close. I'm closer. Oh, I'm closer. Yeah, you're closer. That's old. Oh, wait. It was developed in Canada. Bransford. Have you been to Bransford? Dude, he would have loved to see AI Darth Vader. The first practical commercially viable telephone. I want to see the other ones. Why weren't they practical or commercially viable? Because you had to use your butt. His butt only phone 18. Some guy invented the butt phone in 1855. The guy who invented that was like, I've made a telephone device. We can talk to each other electronically. There's only one thing that makes it perfect. And then they all all the people in their top hats was like, "Oh." Cuz it's like in his ass. Mhm. And he's like they're like, "Is there a way we can make it not use the ass? Can we make it commercially viable?" What are you freaked out about? It's a beeping. He's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] freaking out. Oh, it's the fridge. Oh, you did it, dude. Who who left the fridge open? Not me. But what's crazy is how is he the one doing it and not anyone in that room? That is crazy. He didn't go all the way. They did that and no one else did. Someone got it to be clear. Yeah, I was going to say he came back too fast. Definitely. Just one got it. Crazy. Someone else got it. No one else did. Gary, I'm on edge. You're on edge today. I'm not on edge. You're on edge. You are on edge today. You you we you're on my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Hold on. Hold on. If anyone is on edge, it's you. I'm not on You came out of the room with Nick after hanging out with him for 10 seconds. You came up with a scribble over your head. Do you know why? Do you know why I did that? Why? It's because Aiden was doing work and he wasn't leaving workstation. Yeah, I was writing and you were playing game and you weren't leaving game station. Yeah. And so I figured if I went out loud, you guys would come in and you did. Okay. But I I was playing game because he was late and I didn't chair. I didn't queue up while he was here. I was in a queue game. I was like in a game and then I won and done that stupid Lily. But I know what happened is you lost the best of three and then I think you were mad and then you popped one more. I did but I didn't know Nick was here. I had no idea. He started whistling. That's why I got loud cuz he whistled past me. So I got loud. I don't know. I think he needs to Everyone needs to announce when they're here. I did. That was me getting loud. And I Hey, he looked over his shoulder when I got here. I think that's awesome. He looked over his shoulder when I got here. Who? You. I walked in. He looked over your shoulder. You walked to over here? No, I walked through the front door and he looked over your shoulder. I noticed it, dude. I swear to God. I had this whole thought. I went Maybe he thought I was Lewig. No, I swear to God. I was playing and then you whistled to my left, which is where the set is, and I looked to your left to my left. I I I look, it's weird to make it up. I'm not trying. It's weird. It's weird. I'd make it That's so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] annoying. You were the one who's late. Why is the late guy having the having the time of his life? He's having a heyday cuz I I love the rules. Rules. You're the one that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] gives a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about the rules. Wait, this is what you do. You just deploy the Lwing defense mechanism. It's the best. This sucks. Oh, am I the one who is late and uh and told everybody I'm going to be late in the chat and then everybody waits for me. Oh, but I was in the chair first. Oh my god, it's it's so awful. I saw I saw Slime have a crash out that he would against me, but I was I did it from Aiden's point of view. What happened? Like I imagine what it was like to be you in the chair and when he yells at me for calm issues cuz we were supposed to play games with Squeaks and Squeaks sent a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up message. Disgusting. Just like Vinch's streamer classic authentic idiot message. It was like 11 squirts, but like in Squeaks's special Wuang style. This is sad because Squeaks is like the hold out in my mind of like he's a bastion of responsibility in a world of people who don't know how to do their laundry, but he ain't because his message was, "I'm free from 7:00 p.m. to midnight. When do you guys do you guys want to start in 30 minutes?" And he sent that message at noon. Yeah. Essentially. And it was like, "How do both of these sentences work together?" And Lwig was confused. And for why I was like, for one, this is two AIs talking to each other and one of them is chat GP2 and one of them is chat GPT1. And I'm watching this and I'm like, this is so cute. Cuz now you it's a little taste of your own. But the thing is But the thing is, you know what I did is I got clarification and then I just showed up at the time. Do you know what you did? Oh, I make it hurt. You crashed out on him. I make it hurt. You made it hurt on him. And he's not ready for that. You know what Squeeze's defense was? He went, "I can't make a mistake." Yeah, I can't make a mistake. I can't make a mistake. Have you ever heard Lwig say that without without doing this? Not in his entire life. Without doing That's what I'm going to start saying now. Been doing Patrick Doran's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bald face. This is what I'm going to start saying. I let you guys tell this story, but truth is I already saw this as a YouTube clip. this this whole interaction this whole are you watch your little YouTube clip viewer and this the way the reason this happened was I got on a plane a couple days ago and I I only I always forget to download something to watch before the plane ride and it's a short plane ride it's like an hour so I was like well what can I do so I'm on YouTube and I'm like what person could I watch for an hour and like I'm for sure not going to be disappointed I was like I could watch a squeaks video I don't think I've ever watched one but they're always on my front page so I I watched one and now my whole algorithm is only squeaks they know what you like it's only squeaks it is so awesome they're the algorithm it like that's like that's way crazier than a view. I was close to losing my algorithm to Asmin Gold. Oh, why? It was scary cuz Well, we've been talking about Yeah, you've been studying. I've been studying up. You've been studying the blade. You got to learn from the great. What's your What's your room look like at home right now? Uh I've been getting trashy. I've been getting a little stinky with it, dude. Lwig he cuz he's you talked about changing channel stuff to stream and stuff, right? And you've done it. Yeah. Yeah. He He's sitting on the couch. It was like a week ago or two weeks ago. He's like, "I'm thinking about changing my YouTube channel." And I was like, "What?" He's like, "Yeah." I was like, "Can you explain?" He's like, "Yeah, who's the king of Twitch right now?" And I was like, "Kaisinette." And like, "Yeah." Like, like I wasn't supposed to say that. He's like, "Right, Asmin Gold." Yeah. And then he he said, "Who is a more emulatable king of Twitch?" And I said, "Well, I don't know. Well, you can emulate Kaisenette pretty easy, I think. Yeah, you do it privately. Just refusing to engage with the premise and then it was a small argument about whether or not Lewig could chef it up like Kai, which the answer is no. See, and attitude cuz I the you know what Kai's magic is? What? Is that everyone wants to hang out with Kai? Nobody wants to hang out with me. I gota I gota I gota drag squeaks the slime by the hair to figure out when we're playing games. That's not true. And then Kai gets world famous artist. Ice Spice would like you, man. Ice Spice would [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with me, bro. What the hell would you guys talk about? Yeah, there would nothing She'd ask you to see you see you in a tech. Would you like to see me wear a tech that color? She she's just like on her phone like sure. Okay, I'm wearing it. And and then you said, uh, it's Asmin Gold. And I was like, what? And I threw in my mouth a little bit. And then I I understood what you were trying to say is the the way that his channel operates on YouTube is like gets views. Cuz you were like, "Dude, I went to I talked about Jason the Wii's party and it got 700,000 views on a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] clip." And I'm like, "I get it. I see how Yeah, the Clippers went crazy on me for a bit and the Clippers are going crazy on you, but you you got your own Clippers and they're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sitting there playing with their damn puds. Well, no, now we're full force. It's like the Clone Wars. Oo, the puds are like J cut off. We are I think we're winning. Yeah. Yeah. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] go. I only get dished to Lwin. So, that's a good sign. I mean, that's that's that's the winning. I think the uh I don't think you should have said the n word in front of Mark Phillips. But I didn't say the n word in front of Mark Phillips. What was it? Not in the room. Hold on. The emphasis I didn't say it in front of him. I'll try it again. Okay. I didn't say the n word in front of him. Okay. Sorry. Right. Okay. This is like that Tumblr post where it's two people saying Full Metal Alchemist to each other at their wedding vows and they you can emphasize every syllable of the word and make it different meaning differently and that's kind of beautiful when you're full metal alchemist. Full Metal Alchemist. Metal Alchemist. Is this real? Like if there's No, I I think it was just like a Well, it's playing on the bit of the the breaks in the show cuz the show does this. Man, that show blows. What? All right. That show blows. I don't want to. No. No. I don't want I I I won't let this show devolve into anime discourse. I won't Yeah, it blows. Cool. We record. Is it Does it blow? And they got the metal guy. It's so slow as hell and they got so many recaps. Bro, isn't that every anime that ever existed in the planet? Yeah. Yay. Yay. But I don't have nostalgia for that one. We have to talk about Aiden. Bro, what? What's wrong with me? I just want to clarify. I haven't said the N word in front of Mark Phillips. Okay. Okay. Okay. It's crazy that you had three tries at this and I've nailed everyone. Yeah, technically true. You really are Asmin Gold, aren't you? Listen, Aiden, it's not about what he's done. It's about what he would do. It's about what he's about to do. Oh, so we're going minority report on me now. Actually, yeah. At length last night uh at a gathering you weren't invited to. Yeah. We all hung out without Aiden and we I was thinking I was I was getting mad. I had like a dream where Aiden freaked out. You were in my dream. You freaked out and I woke up really pissed off. I remember it. Do you want Do you want to remember it? You know what it is? No, I know what the discussion was about. I don't remember what my dream was. What was the dream? The dream was that you killed someone and Aiden instantly narked on you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's that he killed someone in cold blood and you were there with him and you were like, "I'm" you were like, "Oh my god. Oh god." And then you called the police. exactly what Aiden would do. Oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dude. This is so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bad. What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you doing, dude? And you're like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crying and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] And then you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] basically you call the cops for real. And we talked about what whether or not you would actually do that for one. The answer was unanimous yes. Even Swift, but I think you shouldn't get a say. So, let's move on. Yeah. And so my uh we started talking about what would happen if any of us killed somebody in cold blood. What would the others do? What would the others do? By the way, he was getting genuinely pissed off at the thought of you doing this in his dream. Dude, I was so mad because he was like cuz he had already convinced himself it's what you'd actually do, which means you've pretty much already done it for him. I guess it's like when you're you cheat on your girlfriend in their dream, right? Give them a scenario. All right. It's you and me. Let's be clear. You're killing somebody in cold blood here. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, right. Oh, okay. So, now I'm being judged. It is not manslaughter yet. If it was in cold blood. Yes. Maybe it was in Maybe I was justified. Actually, I understand that it's in cold blood, right? Yeah. He's a witness to it. It's okay. We're hanging out with uh who's the guy that you guys said that I paraming. Oh, we're hanging out with Steven. We probably shouldn't name him if you're going to go into explicit ways. You're going to kill him. Why do Alex? Uh, well, I think Alex. I would never kill Alex. That's why I didn't like I think that's part of the issue is that it's it was the exact one you used. He used it. No, you said you said Alex does something really dumb and drives me crazy. I strangle him to death. Yeah, but he brought up Alex first. I just latched on to that. But I want you to know I would never kill Alex. Nathan is the name of the Nathan Sans. St. Okay. Happy birthday to him. Happy birthday, Sans. Also, congratulations on your prego baby. Yeah, but you can't kill Sans. He's going to have a baby. This is Sans two months ago. He does not have a baby on the two months ago. He has no come in his balls. He has more coming his balls. No, he has none. He's a dream. The come balls. It takes longer than that. It's Schrodinger's balls. Until observed. Yes. Okay. So, until I'm hanging out with Stans and he starts [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yapping about some dumb [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I get really mad and then I take a cement block and I bludgeon him and he's and he's out. You're in the office. This happens upstairs. Four hits. No, it would take Come on. It takes one. It takes one clean hit. It's fine. It takes I I get in for three. I get in for three more. You get in for three. Nick's here, too. Nick's No, Nick's not here. This happens later. No one sees it. I I see Stan. I see Stans and I go, "Someone tried to kill Stans. I don't I need to make sure they're gone. Cuz it was probably slime and I got cover. Am I there when I hit him? I hit him three more. Make him unrecognizable to his family. I have I have transferred his Street Fighter account to mine. I'm now his rank. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dude. Oh, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] This is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] scary. Yeah, you wet your pants. I wet my pants. Pa circle forms. Aiden, I understand. This is what Aiden does. He goes, "Huh? What? Dan, shut up." But here's the twist. I say, "Aden, I understand you're freaking I I'll grab you shoulder like I'm not going to hurt you. Hold on. Listen, I found out Stan is a pedophile." Yeah. And that's why I did this. Is that in cold blood? Okay. It's not in cold blood. That's cold blood, right? No, that's still in cold blood. It doesn't matter. You can't kill a pedophile cuz they are a pedophile. Why? Why? Because that is not the equivalent punishment. Asthma gold. Oh, we should give them an award. We should make them king of the whole world. Maybe we should give them a sponsorship. Dude, we should make them the president. We don't have We don't do that. That's just not what's No. No. It's a black and white dichotomy where you either kill the pedophile or they become the president. So, I bludgeon stands a pedophile with a cement block that we have that that Jing brought in for the blood. Cool. Uh, it's whatever blood you want to call it. Don't worry about just worry about your morals, not like so Stans is a pedophile in this scenario. I'm there witnessing his execution. He doesn't know he's about to have a baby. But the only info he's not there's no pregnancy, but way before beautiful story though. It's way before all this. Also, he's like a ped. He's about to be changed. You said in this scenario, it's all scenarios. He's always a pedophile. He's not a pedophile. You're You're so hard to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hypothetical. Okay, the hypothetical. Uh I So I get mad at Stan because I have reserved anger and I bludgeoned him and you're freaking out and I tell you he was a pedophile and I was like I got a known fact. He's just saying this is a pedophile. I'll be wrong. He could be wrong within the context of of me understanding that Anthony calls a lot of people pedophiles baselessly. I don't kill anyone. What I'm curious about is this. Does this legitimately change what your actions are? Probably. Uh cuz if it doesn't, then it's irrelevant to You walk in, he's bloody, his face is unrecognizable. His nose is on the back of his head. He's literally bashing on the ground. Hey, don't worry. He was a pedophile. Do you believe him or do you call? What do you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do? Start spinning your keys going. [Music] Oh, by the way, I'm doing the Swedish alphabet while he blushes stands. Yeah, is Los Angeles. But I tell you, I got to go to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Mexico. I got to get out of here and go to Colombia. We actually look at the top five uh non-extraditable countries. There's some great ones. Our Google searches are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. I'm going to Columbia. I got to go, Aiden. I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] leaving. And I give you a kiss on the lips and I say, "I love you." And then and you always smeared on your face cuz he had bloody hands. And now the question, Aiden, is what do you do? Okay. My face smeared with blood, hand burn on it. Blood. He's ostensively murdered pedophile stance. Yes. Yeah. And I And I have a choice. Yeah. Of reporting him to the police or not. Right. Well, even if you choose not, you have to do something with the body. So, you have to go through all of it. No. Okay. Hold on. Hold on. I want to make this easier because let's say this isn't at the office necessarily. It's somewhere where you could just go away and not have to handle it, right? It's at the park and no one's there. Christian will handle it. Even easier. He's definitely a pedophile. He's definitely a pedophile. It was at the park. It's at the basketball park. Just you three. But you know what I'm saying? Like you don't have to like handle a body. You don't have to do any of that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Your job. You could just go back to the office and play Counter-Strike, which you probably are going to say, is he an offending pedophile? Has he Dude, you have to get over the pedophile. You get no extra info. You get no more info. It's only his claim. He's a pedophile after murdering him. I've I've called a lot of people that, but I haven't killed anyone. But that's yo, this is like you know your best friend. My best friend who murdered pedophile stands allegedly. Allegedly. I probably Look, you can't just bludgeon people to death, man. Wow. Okay. Oh, I see where he stands. So, what do you do? I mean, I I it stands, you know. My good my good boy stands. So you bludgeoned your pedophile friend. My pedophile friend Steve. So you call the police immediately. I think I have to call the police. Now let Now let's pivot. Let's imagine it's YouTube lives in Las Vegas, Nevada. Hypothetical, right? But the but the pedophilia is real. And you know I do I do what I do. This one not a pedophile claim. Just it's to bleep this out so many times. No. Yeah. Yeah, if you call him a pedophile, you do. I claimed it as a guess. That's the same thing. You just said it. No, I don't have any proof. What? But I'm looking for the proof. I think I'll find it. I think Let's imagine it's a random person. A random person? Yeah. Random person for definitely. I call it in. You call it in. If it's the person we just named Yeah. Yeah, that we've bleeped out a bunch to make this episode annoying to listen to. I would wait 30 minutes and then call. But your max is 30. Your max is 30. You wait 30 minutes for me. You That's Are you happy with that? You know, I'm happy with anything. I'd give you I'd give you a shot because you don't even exit Los Angeles County in that time. No, I All I'm It's the symbolism of it. No, he could get to like Burbank airport, fly to like Tijana maybe. It'd be really be a tough swing. He'd have to clean. He'd have be full of blood still. I I I ran through this hypothetical yesterday. I told him I would also call the cops. I think I'd give him 24 hours, though. You 24 24 [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hours. That's enough to get out. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] slime. You know about the first 48. What's the first 48? You're cut. If they can't solve it in the first 48, it's likely to go unsolved. I gave the police 24. I gave them an entire TV show. Coin flip. I and I live in Colia for the rest of my life. And cow missiles and in Nick said he'd never call. Nick said he would never call. You can start a business. I could. You can bring cow missiles to cow missiles and cocaine with your son like Topgolf. Come on, MO. We're going to blow this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] smitherines. That's a That is an awesome idea. They make it like on top of an awesome casino. 24 hours. And I was like, you know what? That's okay. How far do you go? So you don't call. Oh, no. I don't call. They show up. They find the body. They find you at the scene of the crime. Are you an accomplice if you don't call? Yeah. So they bring you in. They question you. I'm in I'm in jail for [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] smothering the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to death after he I saw he was still breathing. They go, I see Slime. I'm like Slime did some dirty work. I guess I'm involved now. I go over hand on the neck slowly. And I'm like, sh it's over now. Slowly drain the life out of their body. Just a dead guy. So they go just a dead guy. They go tell us what country he was going to for 3 years in prison. I don't know. I don't know country. I don't know any country. Take a three. I don't know any country. Reverse this for a second. I don't know any country. I murder somebody in cold blood. Call in. Call in. Call in. Call in. Call in. Call in. You're going to jail. Call in. You have terrible reason. You have terrible reason. Oh god. You have the worst [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] reason. Wait. No. He would have the best reason to have the worst reason. You have the worst reason. You would have the second worst. You tried to have the worst my Counter-Strike skin. So I killed him. Nicks would be like, "I accidentally did arson and there was someone there." Okay. And I didn't know they died. So manslaughter manslaughter. I would call that it. I would call you calling that it on me. You call it in manslaughter. Turn down a four. How old's a person? What if they're seven? What if they're Who cares what this accident? Who cares accident? Who cares? The parents wouldn't even care. They'd be like, "Oh, accident. Accident." No, the parents wouldn't go, "Oh, accident." They'd see the billboard and go, "Accident." Accident. That's my call. Honestly, cuz I've always just wondered what he could do. Yeah. Can you handle this one? Yesterday, I saw the same font and and and also a similar looking guy, but it just said accident. I was like, are you the are you the American version? He was a similarly dressed white guy. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. That's It's funny that accident came first. Yeah. And then accident came later. All the white guys were like, "Oh, that's what he was saying." This is the same billboard says. What's Yeah. What's Sweet James in Chinese? Uh, okay. So, so Nick is is the true ride or die. Full cover. He full covers and the cops come to him. He's like, "I don't know any. Why you got necklace?" Yeah. And then, and then I get out and I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] taken care of. You're You are taken care of. I'm taken care of. You're not taking care of the Columbia. wake up with the Cali cartel and he he he starts a booming cow RPG business. Fine, fine. I'd let you get off in this magical world. Is there something to get out of it now? Is there something to get a Cali cartel and now you want my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] blood money now? We don't want your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] blood money. It's just Nick does hypotheticals like my girlfriend does, bro. They're all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Oh, you think girls lie? Yes. And I think you're talking about your hypothetical and you go, "Yeah, I would just not on you and I also would go to prison and I'd probably get out and marry a hot, beautiful woman and then I would save his school children." All realistic. That's his hypothetical. It's like a hypothetical dumb as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I I think it's it's okay to assume that if you cover for a guy like Go to Columbia, rename Slime, too. Slime Land. I'm going to take care of him. Everyone sleeps in closets now. Cool. Cool. This is awesome. Look, the the the the government's going to seize all my assets. Okay, but he's he's he's smart. He's got 24 hours. Why seize all your assets? Because I covered for a goddamn murder. That's not how they did all my No, they're not corrupt. Yeah. You haven't listened to Vinnie Paz once or any awesome immortal. You know what they do to us? You have the Chevy logo on your Tims. That's crazy. They're not Tims. It is so cringe. It's the cringiest thing Nick's done in years is call them Tims. Yeah. You Yeah. I didn't call them Tims. That's so misleading. I said I said one of those Nike Tims. I know they're Nikes. Throw on your phones, guys. Cuz that I think is a weak argument. Why? If I if I saw a big swoosh and said one of those tins, I'd be I'd be uh throwing for the curling. I'd be throwing be throwing for the North American. It's like saying I didn't call Slime a pedophile. I just walked in the room and I said, "What is he a pedophile? Yeah, it's like that. That's really funny. I'm gonna start doing that. Look, look, there's no Is there no tipping point? Nothing I could do that would that would invalidate our friendship because there clearly is. There would be a line I could cross that would you be like, "Yeah, he's betrayed my trust." And I feel like No, I think you could do literally anything as long as you didn't do it to me. I could do anything. You kill Zipper, too. that's doing that's that's happening to me too. That's a personal thing. Agreed. Well, so then should not I'm gonna I'm gonna have to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Liam Niss like or I guess Batman. Huh? If he kills Alex, Alex is like like Zipper 3 to me kind of, you know? So, you just don't care for Sans? I'm saying that like if uh well, I don't know Sans's middle name, right? Does anyone here know his middle name? Uh Lopez. I hate to say he's right. Stan Lopez. Nathan Lopez stands awesome. They're from Yuma. Oh, it'd be so cool to see Stans in the George Lopez intro. Like just one one of them. All the George Lopez cast, but one of them is stands. He's turning around, holding his arms. Well, no. I'm saying when I say it happened to, I mean like like if Okay, if if Aiden goes into a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bank and kills the teller in cold blood and takes the money and runs, that's not happen. He's just committing a crime. That doesn't But if you kill someone I love. I have personal beef with him now. It's different. But me killing the bank teller in cold blood doesn't You're still my homie after that? Yeah. What if he What if No, I'm not your homie. But I'm But but I'm paying you back for the homie years by giving you by by giving you leeway. Wow. By giving you leeway. He shoots the cow RPG at a school. Mhm. For disabled children. Now hold on. Is the school is What's the school mascot? The school mascot is a Cavalier. It's not close enough to cow. Yeah, cuz I can see the confusion. Cuz if it was a cow mascot, you could be like, I see the line of reason. Cuz you might have read you might have read cows are here, right? Yeah. No. Aiden's defense, too. He goes, "Bro, I really didn't know that was a school." And then when you go to see the crime, it's just like it's big words. It says school for young disabled children. And it's like huge. And it's like blinking. Oh, I only looked at the cow and like I saw a cow. Neon sign. It's like an X on a cow and kind of Yeah, there's a sign next to it that says no cows for 100 square miles and you're asking what I do. You're saying Yeah, I'm saying would you nark on him or would you be like, "Dude, no worries, man. I get it, bro. We've all been there. Does he have his headphones on?" He also said the N word after shooting it. Wait, did you say it to me? No, no, he yelled it. He just yelled. Did he turn around? Do that. I would. Everything we've talked about, everything we've talked about, I would do up until now. I wouldn't do that. You're saying why can't you even say it in that situation? What if it's a Make a Wish kid with an RPG on his shoulder. No, I cover. That's crazy. That's crazy. Do you know crazy? I I run into the school. I save all the kids. Yeah. There's Okay. And I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the lunch lady. What? No, I don't do that. Someone has to do that. And that's why the cafeteria going, "What if I had a pussy?" You litigated this whole thing in your in your previous night's dream. And uh I missed game night. I missed game night. I Oh, we played games. Yeah, the games were fun. The games were fun. I heard Wasn't it a game night? Yeah, we play games. I left before, so I don't know. Talking about dreams. We went to Deco Deco and we made little crafts, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] And I crafted a phone. I think this week I walked by Deco Deco and there was two boyfriends outside waiting for their girlfriends. Wow. And I look inside. I'm looking at them. I see just two women inside working on their crafts. And then I I look at them and like, "Hey, you guys checking this out?" And they're like, "Yeah, we're just waiting for our girlfriends." I'm looking at a huge empty room. You I was like, you could just go wait inside or sit next. Yes, inside's gay. We were there yesterday. There was a guy there with like his his wife and his daughter and he's on the phone. He's loudly like Yeah. making crafts. Taking taking like an hour. He was worse than that. He's like, it's taking like two hours. Yeah. So, what what are you guys doing? What are you guys doing? Yeah. Don't leave. Don't leave. He's like saying stuff like that like he's trying to hit the bar before they they stop having [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hate. He's just doing it loudly in front of the kids. Yes, he's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bedazzling some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't know. He was kind of nice how he's like, "Yeah, it looks nice." Oh, they got a lot of beads, swords, and stuff. If I was more comfortable with myself, I might even join in. Yeah, I might even like make something or something. I don't know. It'd be kind of cool. But, you know, I I got repressed masculinity issues. You know what's kind of funny uh is that the word root, the way Australians use it is different than uh most of the world uses it. Yeah, they use it for a different What does it mean in Oh, like definitionally they say it definitely. They use it as like a verb. Like the league term like rooted. No, but you can be rooted by an Australian. Yeah. Isn't that interesting? Anyway, our sponsor for today is Hungry Root, right? Takes care of the meal planning by recommending recipes for your taste, preferences, and health goals. I think I have a problem because I live like a rat man. You understand? I'm trying to be more healthy. I've cut out a lot of foods and I've cut out a lot of bad habits. But you know what's really hard for me is cooking and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Oh, I hate it. I hate that part cuz the prepping work and and having to buy all the high fructose corn syrup before I start cooking. You understand? If you put me in a grocery aisle and there's delicious corn syrup in front of me, I'm going to buy it all. I'm going to buy it cuz I want to eat it cuz it's what my bones want. Now tell Now tell me I personally know about 17 recipes, which I think is a lot. How many do they have? Cuz it can't be more than that. Dude, 15,000. That's not feasible. There's no way. You say that, but that's what it says on the slide. But it's okay. I mean, I'm impressed then. I'm impressed. I'm impressed, too. And they have no high fruition. I can make a meal in 45 minutes. How long do theirs take? 15 minutes or less. [Applause] Also, they got a lot of snacks, which is really cool. Also, cuz you know, I love snacking and you put me in front of that aisle and I get some snacks, but Hungaroo can just deliver the snacks for you. And they got mini mint cookies, salami snack packs, salami snack pack, uh, sour gummies, and probably fruit jerkies. Fruit jerkys. Yeah, thank you for calling that out. Yeah, tag yourself.

Like a light now. Drake. Deco is fun. It was fun. I was They got to We got to solve the bead thing, though. Yeah, we got to solve that thing because I was just like, "Yeah, this part's fun, too." I was like, "This part's the worst." The big thing is when you're done with your deco deco stuff, you have to put all your individual beads back and then you got to remember where you got them all from. They're so tiny. The issue you can't pull extra. That's the real issue. Like I initially I thought pull all the beads you want then use what you use in the exact but you shouldn't do that. You just pull what you want when you want. What am I What am I an artistic genius? I know exactly how many beads I need. He just needs a canvas full of beads. But the canvas is there. You just have to walk. Uh uh I think you need to hire a beadman. Yeah. Literally had a beadman. I'm just someone there the whole time to put beads away. I was saying we pay 400 grand for a from China bead sorter. You dump them all in. It's like the problem. Yeah. And you can do that and it doesn't cost that much but it's it's by weight. I feel like it would cost that so many different types of beads. It's not like we're doing green apple for that many beads. But if it if and the tariffs and the Don't forget my parents. They're brutal, dude. Um, what was I going to say about Deco Deco for Gore? You didn't come, so you're not going to say [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Should do a set there, bro. Dude, yep. There would be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 10 people and it'd be all for this office getting lit at Deco Deco. That'd be so cool. Oh, Drizz is playing. Drizz would make it suck in that play. He's I think I I haven't listened to him. I think he's a bad DJ. He's not I think he's a He's a He's a learning DJ. He's a learning DJ. I guess you have to fail. You kill shake. I'll let you go. My god, yeah, I I uh I really that really did happen. I really did have a dream where you freaked out and I got mad. Uh you know what else though? I think it's if you freak out, I will get way more mad. If you're chill about it and you're like, I got to call the cops. I'd be like, that's fair. Yeah. But I think what I realize if I if you're like freaking out Yeah. and like crying and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and you have your big headphones on, I'd probably get really mad. Okay. Probably kill you, too. I had a dream last night. I was in a kitchen and you know, one of those flip out cabinets kept hitting me in the face and it hits me like three times and then I woke up and I realized that my girlfriend was just elbowing me in the face. Really? Yeah. Like like sleep elbowing. Yeah. Oh, yeah. She was just That doesn't count. So, what'd you do about it? I called her in. I said, "There's a domestic disturbance." Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Please come. Okay, let's change the scenario. What if your girlfriend was the one who killed someone in cold blood? Ooh. And you know she had a gun and she's like, "He's not even a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pedophile. I just didn't like how he [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hangs out here." You know, she had a bad reason. you. She was like, she was like, "Okay, okay." She She killed She killed a man at a kid's park cuz she thought he was too close to the park and had a weapon on him. Upon killing him, he had no weapon. He was just a guy walking in the park. Bro, if you don't call that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in, you are a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I have to call it in. You call it in on her cuz it's it's so disgusting. This is only in the hypothetical. did something wrong. Hypothetical world where I have a full understanding that the kill is in cold blood that the that the there was nothing to warrant it. Me, I would have gotten rid of the body. Why is killing a pedophile still not still cold blood? What does cold blood mean? Am I misinterpreting it? I think you you guys all understand cold blood just means you killed somebody with intent to kill them. There's no like I feel like we're using cold blood as if it's like a legal thing that they say. Cold blood is just doesn't cold doesn't doesn't cold cold blood means that you do it without with in no reciprocatory way what so there's nothing they haven't done anything to you that is causing you to retaliate I'm trying to put myself in the mindset marked by pre premeditation that's way different yeah so it's it's more like she saw that guy at the park she's like I'm going to kill that guy that's not cold no that's not even that's not that's still not cold Cuz that wouldn't be premeditated if it was just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] day of like that. It is premeditation. If you premed what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you just see someone and kill them, that's not premeditated. No, she said the next day I'm going to kill that guy. That's That's premeditated. 24 hours has to pass for it to be premeditated. Why is it cool? Is it cuz you do it like a lizard does it? Presumably you think about killing even if you decide a minute before, but that's not premeditated. So there's some line where it becomes premeditation. Yeah. I mean, you could premeditate like I saw that guy on the street. An hour later you're like, I'm going to kill that guy. premeditated, right? You're you're trying to describe, but if you made some plan to do it, I think it's if you didn't if you're deciding in the interaction with them, then that's not premeditated. So, she's at the park and he's there and then she decides to kill him and then just kill. We just walk up on this guy and in that moment she decides to kill him. I don't think it's that quick. Courts recognizing premeditation can occur in mere seconds. Go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yourself. Well, so long the decision to kill was made intentionally with forethought. Yeah, with mere seconds. Look, it's just I if the way I genuinely look at this is if somebody does that in a condition that is not related to self-defense, it's like a huge fracture of I don't know of my values. Yeah, I almost think I think it's like an L in a way. It's lowkey an L. I think it's highkey a W. Chad, is it a red flag if my girl murder man? So, one one L is worth more than a thousand dubs. Wow. That's what you're saying? Cuz two dubs makes an L. Yeah. Two dubs. Wait, two L's make a dub. Backwards. Do you know when I tell her two dubs would be like a that all this happened, she's going to be furious with you. Yeah, that's fine. That's fine. See, it's fine. It's fine. It's fine. I'll put my head on because she is irrational. I'll b my head like a girl. Three. Hey yo, three. You're mad at me because you think you should be able to kill somebody? Yeah. I just think I should be able to get away with it if you only want to do. No. Sure. Sure. I'd call it though. I'd call it. Also, guys, if I I'll bring it up in the primo. It's a primo conversation, but she gave me intel. You're in trouble. I'm not in trouble. This is about He is in I don't know about this, you guys. In the Why would you save it for the Because the context was in the premo and we have to bring it up again. There's nothing to litigate here. Oh. Oh, there's something to litigate. Oh, I guess that's why you're reacting like that. M I guess this is why you're flipping the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out. You flipped the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out. I don't know any of this. I'm just I'm I'm a little boy. Shut up. You disgust me. Tell them. Shut up. Tell them Steve. Shut up. Maj note on my Starbucks cup. So, it is time. Well, now maybe the last one meant something like I thought. You know, it's it's a guy named Edwin. I see him a lot of the time. It was a guy who wrote he's really cool. And Edwin has boobs. Well, he's big guy. I like Edwin, though. Good enough for me. Edwin. Where were you, man? Last night. Yeah. Uh, I was busy. You're busy. Well, he was busy. That's enough questions. This is awkward. That's enough questions. Please. I'm realizing now that I just did a game night the previous night for my girlfriend's birthday and now we're not doing decom and I'm tired for basketball so I just decided not to go. That was a lot of words for no good reason at all. You just sat at home. No, no, no. He was here. No, I played Counter Strike with Adam of Adam Smash series. You skipped and then I and then I got it. And then I did some work on some home stuff that I've been putting out. You skipped to play Counterstrike to do two things, but yeah, there's more. It was also home stuff. It was also home stuff. Yeah, I can't. Okay, dude. I'm just picking out stuff and buying stuff for the home renovations. I think this is fair. I think this is fair as long as you don't expect to ever be invited ever again till you die. That's not fair. That's an equal trade-off. No, is it not? Okay. One, one, he bailed on the plans that we made to go to the thing. That's not you thing that I'm not part of. I also I I said cuz I understood that I had already made plans to do work and I'm like, "Oh, I probably can't go to that thing cuz I need to do the work." I said five and then he messages me. He's like, "What about 5:30?" He's like, "I had hard five. I had to do hard five." By the way, this is not what happened. I hadn't checked my Hold on. I had my phone. Guys, we can't do We can't do the late. We can't do the late thing. We got to talk about uh more interesting things that happened to us like how we crafted the other night. I know. Mine was really good and Shakes are really bad. I did ask him to move 530. Wait, Shake made something. He did. Yeah. Shake. He made a picture frame. Shake made it like AI would make it. Yeah. Like seven fingers on it. Wait, what' you say? He made it like AI would make it. Oh, like AI. Yeah. Yeah. He's not a really creative. What did he do? Big picture frame. He made a big picture frame to put a picture of his cats in and then he just put like a thousand charms on it. What do you think? What do you think? A photo is going to get into that frame. You think it ever a photo ever gets in that frame? I think he gets a photo in that frame for sure. You think so? No. How does it how did he bring the frame to decare? Bro, you can get frames. I thought it was only beads. Oh my god. She thought it was just beads only. I thought it was just beads. And then a customer walks in and they go and they go they go, "What do you do here?" And then they go, "Unfortunately, you have to bring something." So you just have to leave, sir. I'm seeing the business problem. You have to leave. But we have bead for when you're back. Oh, Draco doesn't have [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] AirPod 4s. They have AirPod 4s. Yeah, you're rich, man. We get it, bro. Yeah, you're breaded and you have AirPod 4s, bro. We get it, bro. Tell them, goat. Yes. Oh, that's so awesome how [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rich you are, bro. Have Oh, you're so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Yeah, man. Tell him, go. Yeah, you and Cinn both, bro. They're both What? What you just said? We're rich. No, I got more bread you'll ever have. Oh, yeah. Wait, what Lwig said to S is, "I've lost more bread than you'll ever get." That's hard as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] which low key isn't true cuz she has mad subs. I don't know. True. I don't think she's I don't know, bro. I've lost a lot. She's laughing. She's lapping Lwig. I It's funny cuz you think money comes from subs. No, she does brand deals. I think S has been a big streamer for like a year, right? No, she she makes she makes a great amount. She really shout out. I pinged her in our Discord to see if she still reads. She does. She replied immediately. Isn't that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] She still remembers her damn roots. I just heat checked her. SA, she has She only has 2500 subs. That's not right. That's not right. That's not That's beast. Wait, go off Stan's channel. Go to SA's. Damn. S's about to catch up to her. Wait, Stan's got 2500 subs. I don't know. A joke. That's No, that was like That's good. He's at like 800, 900, I think. Same as me. And I stream once every two weeks. Don't say it like that, dude. That was really same as me. at all. Same as me. What? That was rude. What was rude? The the adding the how much you stream after. He doesn't He doesn't shill. If he shilled, he'd be He'd be swimming in [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] He shills quite a bit. He shields quite a bit. Stans is taking. It's Weirdly enough, I'm going to stand up. Stan is taking too much. You're the one who called him a pedophile. That was you. I did. And I would do it again. Oh, does it count as Stan's real estate of the episode if it's you calling him a pedophile? I don't feel like it's real estate that he wants. Let's be real. He's going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] react to this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] third channel. He's going to get he's going to get back. I just because I called him a pedophile like 70 times. It I used up all the bar that it doesn't matter if I did it. I still can say, "Hey, we, you know, did a lot." So, you're saying you don't need any meter? You're saying he can reflect on us going too far even though he's the one who used all I didn't say too far. No, it wasn't too far. It was too much. And that's different. That's not different. It literally is different. How is that different? Too far is like the idea of a line being crossed. Isn't too much just another line? Yeah, it's just another line. Too much is like it's simply an amount. We don't differentiate like that. We do as human we have human in this room and nobody in speech. That's a He's kind of right. It has a slightly different meaning. It just it you use if someone went that's too far or that's too much. I think it's like that's too much. It's like it's like you're playing into the bit or like you're trying too hard. That's too much. I can't even say it. That's too much. Stop, man. That's too much. Can't keep calling Pedophile. Is Is there Are you real with you? Hey, what's up? It's DJ Racist. Let me see all the pedophiles in the room. Is there anything you say in that accent that you couldn't say? Is that Oh, this is what Europeans say and then you say anything in that accent. It is a free square. All right. Guys, I want you all just just dance the night away. Would you guys go to a club with me? Yeah, once. Once. I'll do anything once. Go to club. I've been to a club. What club do you want to go to? I want to go I can do anything with slime once. Strip club? No. Strip club? They're sad. They're not happy places. You don't think we get lit, man? Have you ever been to one? You don't think they're awesome and full of They look like that. What? You wanted me to go to the club with Hey, for audio listeners, Aiden has his hat on sideways now. Yeah. And it looks kind of fire. Yeah, it looks I don't know why. It's kind of working. He looks like Austin Reeves. Have you been to a strip club? No. Yeah. Yeah, makes sense. Wait, so you just want to go to a regular club? Uh, honestly, I just want to hang out with you at nighttime. Why? I want to get bottle service and I want we're not gonna drink any of them. And then we just keep ordering more bottles. And then we get all the bottles in the club and we build a little fort at our table. And then when girls try to come, we say, "Get out. Stop. Get out. Get the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out. This is our fort. This is our fort made of Alice." I wonder if they stop you. I mean, I guess you're paying them, but they might. Well, the thing is, if you're not cracking the bottles, they get them back. No. No. I'd sign a contract. I said you can't get these back. I don't bring these home with me, but you never touch these. If you touch these, I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] come for you. You stayed as the fort and then this is the fort. So, if I had said last night, I'm using my one time cuz you've never done deco, you would have come out. No, you wouldn't do a one time there. Surely you've used your one time with him. No, no, not my one time with him. I get If he's never done something, he'll do something once. Here's why. That's what I mean. Here's why I wouldn't. because I told you beforehand that I had to go and I left an insane mess in the office and it would have been super rude to just leave it cuz I probably would have been too tired. It was a a genuine busy day. This is I'll back him up before he left. Yeah, cuz you were here the whole time. So, you have insight, right? I was. You did recon on situation. I think I did pick out a nice vanity. Aiden deserves grace on this one. Why picked out a nice vanity? We were in cahoots. What? We were in cahoots. Me and him made plans and then we [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up our plans and then we had to change our plans. We're a team and if he killed somebody, I'd probably not call the cops at all. But whatever. That's just what I would do. But I want you to know that he deserves a little grace on this one. Anyway, I left a giant mess in the office. It's true. And I was like, if if Yingling comes in here in the morning and sees he's going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] his pants, he's going to ruin it. He would have. He would. He would have. And then he would have been upset because it was PC related. And then he would have gone on some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rant about Anthony in PCs. Yeah, I did break one. He was mad at me, too. It's always some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] He's always so high. That one was different. That one That one was me trying my hardest. That one was That was That was a sponsor PC we had waited 6 months for and we needed for something and we finally got it. We didn't need adding flavor. You're adding flavor. No flavor added. Flavor test. I don't have to put any stank on this. It was just a PC that we were thinking about using vaguely, dude. Okay, now I don't know who to believe cuz you're saying it meant something and you're doing the thing where you're like it like maybe was even like an operational like even we don't need it. Like I could I stream from the office. Listeners, Aiden is going, "Yeah, we do silently with his mouth." This was so much before GM. It's not like we needed to bring a GM either. Either way, everyone talks about PCs like it's Legos. That's what you do. They are. They're not. They are Legos. Broke the Lego. Yeah, but you can't break a Lego. You and Christian FaceTime me and it's just the two apes in Zoolander just like banging on a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson. Oh, yeah. They're pretending to be a Yeah. Yeah. That's how good their acting was. Yeah. Yeah. He thought they were apes. They were two pansies. Yeah. They just FaceTime me and I'm like, "Yeah, I can't really see anything. Can you turn the camera?" And Christian's like, "Okay." Okay. And I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, you just probably be able to take that out." The cool thing about a Lego is when you go like this, it eventually goes in and it's all fine. But if you do that with a 5090 GPU, Yeah. then all the prongs go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and it die. It's just cra I guess you applied that very literally, you know. Yeah. I tried, right? And it didn't do that. Yeah. And it and I heard and then the wires came out frayed. Okay. And this is such an expensive graphics card. No, but the graphics card had to be replaced because they've thought about this. They have a plastic like seating device. Mhm. That you put the graphics card in that goes into the computer and that's where the prongs are. So, the graphics card itself is like perfectly fine. They're built like it's that little piece of plastic that's like 20 bucks or whatever that that had to get replaced. Yeah. Well, you messed it up and then everyone was mad at you and then Kelby was mad at me and I'm like, dude, I I gave you advice without charging you. You would normally charge. I wouldn't normally charge. Well, I do want to build a PC. Why? From the ground up. You want to build one that you've done yourself for the first time? Yeah. You think it's going to be rewarding and it's not? You did it. What? I've done it. Yeah. Was it rewarding? No, it was not. Why not? You had to use your computer. Uh I you do it and then you just go like I feel like I did it wrong and then you have like a problem in two months and you're like that's probably because I built it. Yeah. Wow. I don't have the I I I find the joy in the process. The only time I ever the the very first PC that I owned and built uh I got to I went through like a Hong Kong like threelevel computer store to pick out all my parts. That was the most fun because then exactly that happened. I built it. I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it up a bunch. It was broken for a while and the trial and error was not enjoyable of putting it together. I like the but picking out the little pieces is fun. Trial and error is tilting. It took me four weeks to fix my toilet cuz I had to go through so many flappers. Flappers? Wait, so many different ones? Yeah. Wait, wrong length? No, it's like my toilet's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up and the basin is too close to like the the giant black thing. What? The plunger thing. That's cuz you wanted to be a a handyman. You could have just called a man. I could have. You call a man, but I'm tired of calling the men. I don't. I do my own laundry. Oh, you switched that up recently. I do my own laundry and I fold my own laundry. Wait, what do you call the Okay, well, we don't need to clap. Well, you just said something that's not true. Should I not correct? Okay. You But you used to pay a lot of money. You used to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yourself. I do my laundry. You used to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yourself when you piss. See how he is? You guys are like, "Yeah, they're being [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me." Lwig's like kind of not on edge at all. And then you say one thing about his laundry and he gets his teeth out. You just bring up that I used to do something. You used to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yourself. You used to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yourself, too. I know. And I don't bring it up for you. So don't bring it up for me. See what I'm saying? Is this not fair? What happened to him this morning? We can go off of stuff. How about we use things that we You used to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yourself, too, buddy. You're not. How about stuff we've done in the last year? Why don't we go off of that? Sure. Seems like a fair time frame. The [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yourself still works here, dude. I would love Aiden [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] his white pants right now. Oh my god. I'd tell everyone. Yeah, I would. Don't. No, don't. I would if a Brown SK would be so awesome. It'd be the coolest thing. He throw up. Oh my god. It's like that. Uh I think it was like a a judo round, a judo match, and this guy's in a ghee and he shits his pants. Dude, it's a great clip. It's really hard. I've been [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] myself. Not I mean not myself. I've been [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so much. I started eating like seven fruits a day. Yeah, I love fiber. I eat like two apples in six dates a day. Do you like that? I do cuz that fiber is running through you. I It runs, bro. They don't tell you. I need more fiber bad. Yeah, they don't tell you that. Like awesome. Dunkin' Donuts keeps it all in there like glue hardens it up and then the the apples don't plug. So, are you having like diarrhea wig? No. No. I'm just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like three times a day. Just like three normal solid. But it's like normal. You're telling me you're shooting three normal solid ones a day? Yeah. Yeah. Three a day. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. God damn. That would be honestly that would be like Christmas for me. And so if I did judo and I like had a match, I could imagine it would hit me at at Dream Con. Yeah. If I was doing Dream Dream Con volleyball up close, I'm like, "Oh no." Did you play basketball again at this point? No, I got cut. I was a DEI cut. Oh, why were they posting your score card on Twitter? It was just a random person on Twitter, bro. Oh, that's really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] It was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up, bro. Last year I played in basketball at Dream Con, I got seven minutes played, three rebounds, zero turnovers, zero points, and pretty good stat line. Yeah, pretty good stat line over. Three rebounds. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's like a Tyrese Hallebertton, like no turnovers. Like I'm in that game. And then this year I I'm like I'm like, you know, I'm telling Mark, I'm like, I'm going to Dream Con. He's like, "Hell yeah." And then basketball gets announced. I'm like, "Oh, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah." And they announced a roster. I'm not in it. That's so so you didn't like ask to be in basketball. You just kind of hoped that you would No, I just wasn't in it. And then the next day I got a DM from Leland who's an RDC and he goes, "Yo, you going to Dream Con?" I'm like, "Yeah." And he's like, "Cool. Want to do volleyball?" Oh, that hurts. And I'm like, "Volly? Yeah, we have you down for both volleyball, pickle ball, cricket." Yeah, they they they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] And then everyone called me the DEI hire for the volleyball team. That's so awesome. And I am the only white guy on the team. I'm also fragging out. Did you put up points? I also put I was nasty. Okay. I was an out of real talent. All right, white girl. I know. And that was the worst part is I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lived up to expectations. Was it Was it indoor or beach? It was indoor. You needed to. It was in Houston. Bust down stereotypes by being absolutely dog [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] at volleyball. That's what I thought. I was like, maybe I should be bad, but then SA really just clogged that space up of being bad. That Wait, didn't play? She played. She played volleyball like in school and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Oh no, like in her No, she's done no sports. Oh, me, her, and Cutie did the 100 hits. Oh yeah. How'd it go? We We got it. That's shocking cuz she didn't hit a while. She didn't hit one here. Uh has DreamCom been around a while? Uh I think they're on year four maybe. Oh, okay. But they had 30,000 people show up. Does RDC own it? Yeah, that's cool. I don't know if how like if it's 100% or what, but Shades of Saw Con. There's maybe there's not enough room at the table for any more cons. No, I mean the thing about DreamCon is it's not like RDC con. This all this all makes sense to me. Yeah. It's not like you show up and it's you're there just for the YouTube group. Wait, isn't it I'm sure a lot of people show up and they might not even watch RDC. What is a con for? I guess I don't know. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] This con is for anime lovers. Okay. So, it's like Anime Expo Anime Expo. Yes. It's basically Anime Expo of Texas for primarily black people. You said that the other day on stream and I was like that's a funny thing for Lwick to say. It's the Okay. Why do you go? What? Like a motherfucker's got to I'm not saying you shouldn't crazy. I'm not saying you shouldn't go. I'm more asking it's like I feel like it's a celebration of like black creators and people in this space and I'm looking it's like oh it's RDC we got love and then and then it's what I mean it's a bit of a is it like a is it chill like it's like gamer of the year haha like kind of scenario I'm sorry do you go around to black theaters and then you go you go why are you here at anime expo no obviously different. You understand? You're the one who you you didn't say Anime Expo is the white version, but you're the one who prefaced the event. I would argue Anime Expo is the white, Hispanic, uh, and Asian version. What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you talking about? That sounds so much worse. That sounds so much worse. So much worse. Sounds like black people are not allowed. That's what it sounds like. I'm telling you, they only allow it to like white, Asian, Hispanic, Native American Indians. You understand what I'm asking? This is a This is a convention that is a celebration, I assume, of like black content creators and black people in the anime space, but it's not exclusionary. I'm not saying it's exclusionary, but it's I didn't see anyone's welcome. Are they inviting you? Yeah. I'm not like showing up and and they're like, "Uh, I guess you can do badge pickup here. That's honestly that's kind of what I thought. No, I thought you were just I thought you were kind of showing up like you were getting involved last minute like the Kendrick Lamar live show. Why is Lwig from video games from video games at Dream Con? The Kendrick Lamar is maybe an example of this. Yes. But the Dream Con is not. If they look if if like RDC invited you, it makes more sense to me. It's just funny because you're like one of the only white guys there. So, I thought you were just kind of like, I'll go like they they invited him to play volleyball like a like a Shen Yune performance. Oddly enough, you had to do the whole Shen Yune thing as well. Part of it. I was invited personally. Okay. By by Mark. No, that's great. Mark was Oh, Mark. That's cool. Yeah. Who's Mark? Mark Phillips. He's like the guy the part of RDC the guy even I know cuz he uh he's he's like god and Tekken plays Tekken. Yeah. But it w it was noticeable cuz they did keep calling me the DEI guy and then and then I forget who someone was like. Yeah, you're one of the good ones. How's it feel, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] How's it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] feel? Don't say it was great. It was great. I I was like thank thank you actually. I I've never heard that. If you guys ever just want a a a clear example of power structures and how they affect people, what a treat. No, I like that. What besides volleyball, what did you do? I mean, I flew in and flew out same day. I actually hit a PB Houston uh George Bush George W. Bush uh International Airport PB in at 9:05 in my seat at the airport 911. Whoa. Uh, so you went to George Bush Airport in your seat at 911, right? Yeah. This is a real story. No, no, no. I got in the airport at 9:05 and I got in my seat by 911 o'clock. I'm telling you, it took me six minutes from out the Uber into the seat. That is kind of crazy. This is phenomenal. This is like a Lwig thing that he keeps track of that normal people don't. What airport? George Bush International Airport. Oh, on the way back then. On the way back. Yeah. I didn't know he got an airport. He got an airport. Yeah. I think low key he shouldn't have. Why? Wait, he's the governor of No, no, no. I I look George He given the airport. Yeah, is my question. You know, like George, are you talking about HW Bush? No. No. George W. George W. Bush. So, what happened on his watch? He gets an airport. Wait. Yeah. Yeah. Why don't we give him like a Dunkin Donut? New Bush or old Bush? New Bush. George W. Yeah. Right. Right. Right. Also, old Bush didn't even get reelected. There's no way he'd get an airport. Well, he was the head of CIA. I think New He wouldn't get an airport though. should not be given anything to do with planes. That's what I'm trying to say. It's weird. It's a weird thing to give him. Why? Cuz it happened on his watch. But for seven years, it didn't happen again. Yeah, but it happened really once. Shame on Shame on you. It happened really. The only reason I'd say he shouldn't have gotten it is not because it happened on his watch. It's because he never killed Osama 7 years after. It's crazy how long it took. Yeah, Obama did it. I know. That's crazy. I like how we say they did it. He was in like Obama was in [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Navy Seal gear just like he's jumping out of the coff. It's funny cuz we me and Cutie watch the Netflix documentary about 911 and we talking about a bit, but uh Obama got in the office and it's a bunch of CIA directives or directors and they're like, "Yeah, Obama got in." And he was like, "Double down." So we doubled down and I was like, "Okay, I'm sorry." So, when George Bush was in, what was the directive? He's like, "Hey, get go easy on him." He's more of a misunderstood type of fellow. Take your time on this one. We don't know if we did it. Oh, man. Yeah, he's got an airport, man. And I six minutes, bro. Well, that's great. I'm glad his airport runs so efficiently. I still think should have an airport. I said it a long time ago, but I've been saying this. I think we can get one is what I found out. Yeah, like a tiny ass one. You can get a tiny ass airport. Yeah. do something with your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] life. I just don't think it's worth cuz the airport would be so tiny that the people who act like the only It'd be cool if I if it was like a training airport. H I don't want like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Wait, are you going to teach people to land? Don't shrug. He shrugged. It's a business. We're going to make money. I have an instructor. I have an instructor. You and I are Oh, yeah. Yeah. Who that know? Corwin. Oh, does Corin teach could he teach someone? Could he teach me how to fly? Could he teach us to fly? Yeah, let's fly. Can I fly with him? You just keep asking it. Like, is the more the more we go here, the less serious I think you are. Cuz I actually thought you were serious. Serious. Can I be your cop? No. Let him be Let him be your CP. Your CP. I'm First off, there's CP on the plane. Well, usually there has to be. There has to be CP on the plane. You can't take off without CP. You do. You just wouldn't want it to be one man. You would want the man to be You would want the man to be flanked by CP. His choice of CP. This is Yeah, man. Thank you for that. I just It's weird that I was like fly. I am the co-pilot. He is a certified train. He pilot. No, I'm He's the Cuz I would come I would You wouldn't know I stowed away. There's more seats in the back. They could sit in the back. I sneak up behind him. I'm not going on a Cessna. I crack his neck and then just me and you. But the Cessna is that bad. He's lying. It's scary. No, it's chill. They're scary. I've been on it. It's scary. It's not scary for sure. Huh? Would I be scared as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] It's like uh it's like the difference between riding in a awesome Escalade car and then driving a 50 C scooter where a single gust of wind pushes you over. Yeah, this is just how it is. I do like how cavalier you are about it. That's very confident. Yeah. Smaller planes just get tugged around. They get tugged. You haven't watched the new Nathan Fielder show. All I've seen are the headlines about it, but watch a second of it. Pretty awesome. It's like a It's like a It's like a a look inside of co-pilots and how they speak to each other and how it causes plane crashes. That's scary. Yeah, it's wild. And then he does like simulated like like he takes people who are actually pilots and he he works them through exercises to see how they'll they'll act and stuff. It's very interesting. He's on some like artistic [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] now. Yeah, he always been though. I mean it I guess it's like he's he's he's going further into the idea of like what can I do that's you know something no one really has done with like TV or whatever. Yeah. I mean I think when you hit your 10-year comedy central mark and that's what we're talking about. We do you you either become Ron Burgundy doing uh 15minute standup routines at on a PayPal Zoom or you end up that rules, right? So you think that rules? Yeah, bro. You do the the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Christmas Apple uh keynote internal and you make 400K and you go, I'm Ron Burgund. Hello San Diego. Um there's a whale [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in my iPod. The shareholders are expecting some equity. Oh god dude. And every like Jesus runs bro. Get him to do like a Doge thing as Ron Burgundy. He's out bro. He's out bro. They vibe them out. Or or maybe just any other crypto. You just want to get crypto rich. I want an ep I want an epic Facebook meme with Ron Burgundy and crypto and I want to be welfare. Why? And why can't he have it? Nick asks for so little. Do you guys want to get rich? I got a plan for you. Yes. No. So we talked about last night. We got to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] get rich somehow. What? We'll do it. He his H his solution is stupid. Please, Lwig. Pull out 20K. We go to Vegas. We put it all on the Pacers. He thinks he's the god of sports betting though. Yeah. What's up with the sports betting? I haven't missed in in months. What if we bet on this? Bad taste. How about we take We can bet on the Thunder. Nope. I'm I'm calling this one. Aiden. Aiden, I Let me tell you my track record real quick. Can we enter Nick Yingling into the Special Olympics? What did you say? And pet on it. What did you say? Nick Yingling. Can we enter Nick Yingling into the Special Olympics? Is that what you just asked? Like the movie The Ringer? No, you can't enter him like and then fix matches. I think match fixing in any capacity is the new wave and we should start doing it. First off, yes. But second off, Nick Engling is not good enough at any sport to even be thought of to qualify. That's why we can't enter him. We get him back in. He check checks all the other boxes for you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The issue is that he wouldn't be able to keep up. No, that is amazing. They're phenomenal athletes. I don't know if you've watched Special Olympics are phenomenal athletes. Yeah, it's weird. Now that I think about it, Sean Gar put out that like 50minute advertisement for match fixing. He's like, "Get in on this." He's like, "It can make hundreds of They're making so much. It's completely unregulated. It's unregulated and it's hard to uh it's hard to prosecute. It's borderline unttrackable and and it's disgusting, dude. They're Dude, they're throwing ranked matches for bread. Yeah, that's a that's a that's insane. What's crazy is that there's people betting on the ranked match. That's what I'm saying. It [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up that I instantly was like, I want to do that. Wait, bet on a ranked match. Yeah, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it. It's like a horse bed, but not a fixed not a fixed one. No, I want to bet on like a regular one. Well, well, well, if it's match, it's it's pretty much fixed. Do you have a team in tier two that maybe we could like get involved in this? Aiden, we got a couple. We could have fun is what I'm saying. Can you sign? We did. That guy's funny. Is that a person? It's a valor player. It's a valor player. We did. That's what I said. Yeah. Yeah. No. Why? Busy. You just found out who he was from this conversation, didn't you? No. That's a bad look. I've known weed for months, if not weeks. That's a bad look. Why is that a bad look? Cuz I don't know someone. You won't. What? What about her? Do you know her? Yeah. What's her middle name? Of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'll bet on the Patriots with you. What? I'll bet on the Pacers with you. Okay. Yeah, please. Because they're going to win. Let me tell you my track. Let me tell my master. Let me tell you my track record. Okay. Last week I made a sports bet. I bet on the Pacers and they won. Okay, that's great. Then then they played again game game uh game five. Yeah. I called that the Pacers would win by 17 before the game started. Guess how much they won by? 18. 17. 17. on the dot. Did you bet? Okay. No. No. So, you only bet the first time last night. So, you don't have any conviction? No. It's just cuz I had to go to Vegas to bet. What about What about using one of the apps that everyone in the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] world use that's ruining the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lives of so many people? These kids betting on tier 2 Valerant matches. They're like, "Fuck, I just don't I don't live in Got to go. I can't go into Caesars." Last night I called Yankees beating the Dodgers even though the Dodgers beat the Yankees the night before 18 to2 right and now I'm calling the Pac I can't miss bro you remember my father yes yeah this is what he did I have the same touch he has yeah he didn't have a lot of money toward the end for most of the time it's cuz he didn't start with a lot yeah a lot if he just had Lwig's bankroll it actually would have gone perfectly so not cuz like or the the if you were to double up. That'd be so much less cool than if you lost it all. Yeah, that's how gambling works. Like, but I'm saying like, you know, if I have $1,000 Yeah. and I double it to 2,000, it's kind of dope. And if I lose it all, it's kind of like, ah, I'll get $1,000 back. He loses all his wealth, all of it. You're talking about the amount. He has so much money, it's too much. It's practically kind of infinite. So, if he loses it all, then it's no longer infinite. But doubling it is still infinite. Yeah. But, you know, it's still possible to lose it all. And that's why I think Bruno Mars is so awesome because he's short. Cuz he had a gambling addiction. Cuz he has so much money yet he still went in the hole. Oh, also, yeah, Drake, too, right? Isn't it alleged that Drake is hella like in the in the hole? Bruno Mars is in the hole. Yeah, look up Bruno Mars Vegas. He was like down 65. He owed 65 million to Vegas or something. Oh my god. Yeah, it was like an insane number, dude. That's That's so beautiful. I know you can't escape. Yeah, you can't escape the Sirens Call of the F. I feel like he has so much more than that. Bruno Mars. Yeah, you would think he is like he's like ghost riding so many songs. Uh he's doing a Vegas residency. Oh, the residency. Yeah, that means you're Can you look up gambling? That means you're stuck. Yeah, Bruno Mars. No, get rid of residency, though. Uh rumors about Bruno Mars having a $50 million gambling debt with MGM Resorts has been debunked. They say [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that. But then he's doing a residency at MGM Resorts. Curious. Curious, bro. I for one love rumors and saying things that I don't really know about. He's talked about it. Bring Mars is a pedophile. Whoa. Here we go. That's too much. I've talked about this once. That's too much. That's too much. That's too much. After this episode, that's too much. Oh my god. I hate Europeans. I'm sorry. He just has a gambling debt. This is a gambling edition. It likes going up to out to that's all he likes doing. You know how the world's kind of writing itself and and correcting itself is because I don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] touch gambling lately for like a year and I don't care about or think about it and all you do is think about the Pacers and how they can make you money. Yeah, I'm back on it. I love gambling again. Gambling rules. I've won. I've only won. There you go. Vancouver turned you. Vancouver. Early was TwitchCon. I run a lifetime at TwitchCon. Gambling is awesome. We should do it. Yeah, dude. I love it, but I don't think about it now. Dude, when I went to fill the gap in my heart. I went to Plaque Boy Max's uh album release party. Was Little TJ there. Uh I don't think so. They're still beefing, huh? I don't know what you're talking about. He smoked in the crib. He did smoke in the Airbnb. I guess he Well, I didn't see him. It didn't come up. That's you probably shouldn't have brought it up. You're not supposed to smoke in the Airbnb and he smoked in it. Mhm. Yeah, but he's a TJ gang. But it's part of the rules of the Airbnb. So like you Yeah, but you never just like says no smoking. You just Every Airbnb has the little TJ amenment. Never done that. But anyway, I was there and uh and it was just like it had a big gambling sponsor. Okay. It was like I forget the company. It's like Verbbo. It's like gamble Verbbo. And it's like everywhere. It's on the cups and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] And then I'm talking to the Faze guys. I was like, "Okay, this is how you're paying for the party." And then they're all like, "No, dude. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this gambling sponsor." I was like, "What? Isn't this like your party?" And they're like, "No, we had somebody set it up and then we just showed up and there's a gambling sponsor." They didn't know. Yeah. They need like a They need like a manager. Yeah. They need like someone that knows how to do the things they don't know how to do. Do people work at FaZe still after the the repurchase? Yeah, they have many, but I think most of their employees are around content. I'm the get lit coordinator at they at Dead Ass. They have like streamer university. You don't actually understand. The people who work at Faze are nerds. Brian is Candy. I hope so. Uh Chester does Getting Lit. Mhm. The people who work there are authentic nerds. I thought you I thought you were the get literally the CEO of Candy. He does Candy. Uh montage editor. Montage editor. Go down list seven more. Did you see the new Did you see the new COD montage? I did. Yeah. Nick didn't like it. Yeah, it was a lot of animation. The clips are good. I just think that the 3D [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Worldstar hip hop Nike commercial aesthetic is kind of lame, but the clips are good. Clips are good. Oh, I don't see you dropping [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Is that how I sound? Oh, you brought this up. It hasn't dropped into Oh my god. But that thing happened with uh my friend, bro. I haven't talked to him in a million years, but we were My friend was watching the Dodgers verse uh Cleveland. Oh. and that Cleveland hit a home run and we realized that the guy who hit the home run was on my Call of Duty clan when I was a kid. That's sick. Isn't that wild? We saw his name and we're like, "What?" So cool to hit a home run. He's an MLB player. That is so hard to do. How many people do you think have hit a home run in the MLB? It's very well doumented thing to check. He's probably the only guy to hit a home run and a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ladder stall twist. What? Probably. No, nowadays the youth. No, in the MLB. Oh, no. I'm saying I think the MLB players nowadays have all played COD. Not like Not like that, bro. Maybe not. Maybe they're Maybe they're as bro. Uh, how many people? Probably like a thousand. That's a good baseball been around for hundreds and hundreds of years cuz so many players are in the league. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, and it's been around for so long. It has to be thousands. Do you think that Are there MLB players who have never hit a dinger? Yeah, for sure. That's got to be sad. A lot. That's like That's like you don't even tell like you know you're 60 or something. People like, "Weren't you an MLB player?" Like your extended family or something. You're like, "No, it wasn't." I'll go 2,350. Uh, all right. 5,600. Sorry. What's What's the How many MLB players have hit a home run in in all of history? How many home runs? I'm going to say You said 2,000. I'm going 2,500, dude. I'm going to say less. I'm going to say like 1,200. And you're a,000. 5600. Oh, I'm the closest. Okay. Well, AI says it's 7700. Yes. And then it's from a Reddit eight years ago Reddit baseball post that. So AI just took the top Reddit post. Dude, AI is so stupid. Why can't they make it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] work? I mean, it'll get good. I mean, that's all. God, it's so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] according to Go back. What does it say? According to baseball reference, a database that considers major league. So then the Redditor is just citing the same stuff. But the the funny thing is the AI is citing it from 8 years ago. So it's like saying according to this database that's so outdated. It's irrelevant to use. Insane, bro. Why is it at the top of the thing? But Google's behind, bro. Cuz Google's behind. No, they're not. Well, some are ahead inherently. They're all They all suck. Yeah. Do you like how Siri talks to you now? I don't It's diff. Yeah, Siri talks kind of like sirly now. I heard she sounds drunk. She goes, "Okay, Ludwig, I'll text Nick Yingling. What did you want to say? YouTuber?" And I was like, "Uh, just say hi." Uh, I signed us up for something, by the way. What? What? What? Not you guys. You guys aren't part of this. You and Yingling? No, me and Nick. Was it Maj? What you? I signed us up for a PSL $10,000 faceoff against FaZe Clan. It's your dream. That's going to that we're going to Wait, it's your dream. Who's our team? It's me, you, Nick Yingling, Alex Smokes Mid. Okay. Who's their team? It's phase. It's Adapt. Jason the Wien. Okay. Ron and Lacy. Oh, we can win that. Oh, that's wable. I know. We can win that. We actually do win that. And it's best of three, COD 4, Halo 3, Black Ops. Okay. I thought you were going to say Black Ops 2. You mean it's adapt banks temper. Like just No, no, no, no. Oh, yeah. And they're going to come up to PSL and we'll play them. We have a four cup 10. That's hype. You go have Do you want to win half? I do. Yeah, I'll stake you guys. You win what you put up. Mhm. Can we don't stake? I can stake it all. I'll just win it all. See, this is what I would sports bet on. I would sports bet on this. You sports bet on this? No, cuz this is fit. Yeah. Yeah, we'll do it. Yeah. Adapt is very confident in Black Ops 2. Yeah. And he thinks they can take COD 4. Oh, I can't bet against I can't bet against Lacy cuz he just came out as bisexual. No, dude. Yik said Yik said that he did, but then Lacy replied, "Man, I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you become a loser. This is your life. You You contribute to this more than anyone in in your life and I just because I at dinner bring up what Yoxic tweeted out and then Lazy responded underneath, I'm a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] loser. You create losers." We were at [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we're at [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dinner and this guy goes, "Guys, joxic so Lacy said Jox said he's bisexual and Lacy said he's not bisexual and I think they're working together." Did you say that? Lacy said, "I'm not gay." I thought that was so funny. I thought it was so funny to reply to bisexual allegations about I'm not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] gay. And we're at dinner, bro. Who [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cares? It's We didn't talk. We talked about it. That's it. What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] else did we talk about? Me in your dream. That's what I'm saying. I'm electric. It's crazy to talk about Yik at the table. That's so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] insane cuz people talk about Lwig at the table. Do you think they get made fun of by their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] friends? They pull up their phone and they go, "Guys, did you see that Lwig?" Do you think they bring up Ara mogul's account? They're like, "Ooh, look like Coots got a surgery. Kill yourself. You're not better than this shit." I'm not. What do you What was that? I'm saying that the me talking about Yoxic and Lacy at the dinner table is no different than someone talking about you and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Jason. The issue isn't talking about it. The issue is pulling up your phone to live read it like you read it, which is Oh my god. Yik said Lacy's gay, but Lacy replied that he's not gay. That was interesting. That's not good. That's not good engagement. That's funny. It'd be fine to do it if you had read it and remembered it and wanted to bring it up. That'd be funny. What are you talking about? It's the reading of it. The reading of it makes it bad. Can you explain why? Cuz you're basically brain rot scrolling Twitter and then just verbally expuning what you see. But it's interesting. I thought that was interesting. Lacy denied it. Because I thought that Lacy was bisexual and then he denied it. That's crazy. So, okay. If I did on the pod, would it be okay? Do you think there's a difference between the pod and sitting around with our friends eating chicken? No. I think that's the whole point of this pod is that it's not supposed to feel different. You're such a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] All you do is twist. You twist and bet to make your arguments [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] work. It's disgusting. You're so good at finding a way to win. I think that's what makes our pun special. Really? It feels It feels like you're at the table with us. It doesn't. We're not You're not at the table. If you're listening right, you're at the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] table and then Aiden would [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] vibe you out and I actually would be nice. Yik said. What did he say? I'm interested. Shut the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. I also think Yik Loki has a crush on Suda. Low key, what are you? What are you? Look at Look at how sad he like Caesar. Mute mute. Mute a Yoxic on Twitter. If you care about me as a friend, mute him on Twitter. He's still replying to Jake Lucky, man. You're two and0. I I still have my fast ball. Yeah, I I've been really nice on Twitter, but I You could still have your fast balls like punching a 5-year-old in the face with a tenn ball. That's your fast ball. I'm still dunk. Jake Lugie tweeted out. He's like He's like, "Yo, here's the new Faze House. It's like a video like he uploaded a video of like the Faze House like thing which is actually the old OTV house which is crazy. And then I I replied under it. I was like this one's going to do numbers Jake and it's just like this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up ratio. I I checked I had looked at Jake's Twitter account in a while. I check it because of this interaction. He unfollowed me and in my head I'm like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I do? I do what I do [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me for. Why did that make you feel big doing that? Do you feel like a man when you said that to Jake? I think it's important. You see the ratio and go, "No, I don't care about the ratio." You brought it up just now, so you care a little bit. He smiled. It's more It's more that the ratio is extremely funny, but I would have done it knowing I would get zero likes. And that's just the truth. I believe that. So, it make you feel big. It makes me feel No, it doesn't make me feel big. Are you sure the ratio? I don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about the ratio. It's about responding to him and saying, "This is stupid. What you do is still stupid." At least Yik is doing actual brain rot. Jake Lucky is trying to like pretend he's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] journalist. There's a sincerity. Toxic is a journalist who not disrespect his craft. The Lacy gay or not? The evidence was overwhelming. And Lacy is a proud bisexual. And finally, I have someone else in media to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] And you shake your head because of your homophobia. And that disgust on Pride Month, too. They pride month, which makes it even more disgusting that you stole gamer of the year. I didn't steal gamer of the year. I earned it from the gay people who you are saying I don't support. You know why he got gamer of the year? It's because he's like this thing they all I think they all think they can turn him. That's why like Austin show could be gamer of the year. Like a hand. No, he couldn't. No. Why? He's horrible at games. That's half of gamer. Who's the best gay gamer? Me. The best gay gamer. Who could it be? Sonic Fox. Yeah. Yeah. Probably Sonic Fox. It's got to be Sonic Fox by a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] by a lot. It's not closed. Let's go. Gase closed. That was uh that was really easy. Wow. Maybe if our tour came out as gay. Sonic Fox is better. Sonic Fox is way better. Better than Artzi. Yes. Plays one game really good. Yeah. Okay. Uh, you know what I was surprised by in the last episode? You said like, "Hey, if you're from Malaysia, you know, let let us know if you're listening and if you've seen any probabiscous monkeys." And then there were a lot of people, a lot. And it was it was without fail 100% of the people who said they were Malaysian said they had seen one. And I was like, they Oh, that's like In-N-Out over there. Yeah. They're just everywhere. They're just Dude, somebody posted even one person posted a photo like hanging out with two of them. Like there's two right here with a proiscus monkey. Man, I want to go on like a monkey world tour. Dude, you should get like one of those books like for quarters from every state, but with every monkey and you get like a paw print of every monkey or something like Oh my god, what a good idea. Go around the world collecting your monkey book. Go to Thailand, go to Malaysia. Where are gorillas? The episode we never did. They're in Africa. Go to Africa, find some gorillas. I wanted to do the episode at the monkey sanctuary if we could have the monkeys around us. I think most cool animals are in Africa. They are so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ugly. I can't lie. There's cool ones. Zip. Can you bring my clip on? No. I think most cool animals are in Africa. Yeah. I feel like South America. South America cuz they have the rainforest. I don't think there's the I don't You know what? The rainforest when I was a kid disappointed me. You went to the rain? Disappointed you. You went there? I never went there. When I just looked into what they had to offer, I was like, I disappointed you before you The Amazon rainforest let you down. I thought it was a bland selection. Yes. I thought the selection was bland. The center the the the greatest amount of biodiversity. They talk about how the biodiversity is so huge because they have no big names there. It's like they have a thousand fights but no headlines. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] YouTuber you are. They have no headlines. You're a disgusting little man. I'm unimpressed with what they have. No headlines. I just wanted to play this. I think you guys may have watched this. I put it in We need volume up immediately. I'm not kidding. This is a crime. Okay, so I put this in the group chat. I was at a wedding and the DJ was not the best DJ. Oh, I watched this video on mute and so I didn't understand it cuz you just zoom in on the window. Uh well, at the very bottom you'll see the DJ's head and he's nodding his head like he's cooking, right? This is potentially the worst mashup I have ever heard at any party, including Dre. Okay, give it a give it a rock. [Music] Dancing Queen and Usher. Dude, it's like and that that it wasn't a temporary transition. Yeah. This was like he played the whole thing and they're singing like in a weird devil demonic tone. Yeah. It's like an augmented Dancing Queen. I almost rushed the guy. Yeah, that would be fair. I wouldn't blame you. That's kind of a study in like how music can sound bad to our ears. Like what? Like there is a concoction that guy made. It's like, "Oh yeah, we aren't wired for that." I don't call him in. I think if I'm there for that, what it immediately made me realize is that Drizz could do a wedding now. Yes, he's ready to do a wedding cuz he would be cheap. That's why. Yeah, he'd be cheap and he'd play a song and more qualified than that guy. Premium. Drew is not to man. He doesn't have a place to demand a premium. That's what you know what we're paying. You know what? Mogul pays him for PSL. Wait, what do we pay him? Oh well. Well, I guess we'll go to the primo cuz we want to avoid that situation. No, my new Nick. Wait, we're doing a 10k money match in COD. Yeah, that's crazy. I just It just came together. And then we're going to flip it on the Pacers. Yeah, I'm down for that. We was in the That's a bottles up when I first met you. We're going to strategize in the Patreon. We're also going to bring up Aiden's phone. We don't need to bring We're going to talk about it, Aiden. I don't want to hear another word. Bring this up. His nasty ass little tongue. Goodbye. Bloodwig the streamer walks up to the counter. What does he say? Can I get uh give me a 10piece chicken nuggets? And uh yeah, maybe maybe Diet Coke. Give me Diet Coke. She turns around at the register. It's Marggo Robbie. Would you like to hear our specials? Lwig says, "You're Lwick's now." And he goes, and then it just looks at it look it it zooms in on Lewig and instead it just starts playing Yeah. the the Zi and then it starts playing um
