what's the idea there it's just everyone's the highest amount of energy they can be oh is literally they skating as hard as they can and they do like Fast Subs they don't like they're not like while it's happening yeah yeah they just they literally just Hop On Hop out I'm throwing an extra guy that happens a lot and they get P punished really well yeah if you accidentally put on an extra guy

just like behind them walked everywhere they go like been really loud oh we're having fun too oh you can't stop us from coming we're not technically with you I need to tell you guys this I need to tell you guys this before sh tells you guys this so what is happening what happened while I was there while I was there I wake up on like the second night I've got a really bad tummy ache it wakes me it's so bad it wakes me up which is a pretty bad yeah you know it's pretty bad the next day I can tell I can tell I need to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it needs to happen at some point and I keep going to I keep going to the bathroom it's not coming out dry and I'm now I'm constipated and my stomach hurts this is awful and then and somewhere around somewhere around three p.m. that day I hit the bathroom and it starts coming out and it's the worst you've ever seen it is a it's a water fountain and and you're screaming big down there I'm grunting and it's it flows out it's like the gates have been released and I you know and I think I'm done 20 minutes later it's queuing up again y hey me and you both for the remainder of the day day and then into the entire next day every 20 minutes I have to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I have to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] of a waterfall that's what you get white baby it's horrifying I am [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so often and wiping so much that my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stings from being rubbed raw and and my girlfriend bought me weet wet wipes at a you can't flush those so you didn't have to tell us all that you them are you not supposed to a Mexican to you flush that no no a lot of them are flushable now so we're walking we're walking around it says flushable they're still not flushable he needs to know this wait really yeah I feel why would they write the word dude I feel even worse now cuz we were like you you know when you do the thing I I don't want to come in and use the bathroom without like getting something right so the first like couple cafes of the day you know we buy stuff dude you're like sweating just like people but we bought too many Cafe like too many coffees and pastries like I I can't be more caffeinated I'm I'm trying to stay hydrated I'm interrupting like the itinerary that my girlfriends had planned for a month for my like Bono tourism and I and the last dude we're like and we're getting closer and closer to our flight that evening keep in mind at this point I've literally been [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for over 24 hours that's awesome and it is so awful and I walk in I'm I'm desperate I've tried to hold this one and I I find the only place is this tiny Cafe where the the the space is like the size of the set and at the back is a restroom but instead of being like a separate room it's just a little like hole in the wall like with like a sliding door that's like open at the top and the bottom and it's open to the cafe where the staff is and I asked I as on a show can I use can I use your back I have no choice I went and looked around first and I like ran in back to this one cuz it was the only one I could see and I because I've been holding it it's worse so I'm in the bathroom but they can definitely hear in the cafe as the woman is like pressing juice listening to like in the bathroom and you're going and then and I'm trying and my but hole stings and I take out my wet wipes and you hear the packaging like opening and stuff like that and then and then you're crinkling diaper and then it gets worse the the the the the worst the worst part of this that is okay after I get out after I get out of this bathroom I look this poor teenage boy and the woman working there in the eyes and they don't look happy and I'm like and I just say you know oelo like you said o Arnold Schwarz and I a walk out like I and I'm so ashamed of what's happened and but I still have to go but we have this long walk to a museum and I'm so embarrassed by what's just happened I don't I don't want to ask another bathroom and like have this happen again because it's been happening all day and you're clogging every toilet on the way with your wet wies with the wet wipes the wipes dude that Cafe had to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] plunge your wet wipes out know that makes me feelo L diesel Derek so we have to walk we have to walk 45 minutes to the to the museum we're going to and on the way it's coming back and I'm like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I just I cannot do this again I cannot go into another Cafe and not it's sorry it's crazy that you guys are still out yeah why don't you just go back to the H we already spent half of the previous day inside and it's like our trip was only four days at a certain point you call it you're sick yeah I feel like at that point she's got to be like you know what I get it we we f U you lost probably leaving like a slime trail of poop behind you for the for the police to find you later so floating like it's Donuts maybe maybe if I I'm I'm I'm we're like the American sh has been here huh 1520 that's your Mexican yeah that's my Mexican cop that was that was crazy transatlantic Mexican cop he came he came from like I don't know Wisconsin that's like it always SNY when he's like yeah do a Brazilian accent he's like

erase it it's been zero days since Aiden [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] himself so I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] myself in front of your girlfriend who you love and she doesn't realize cuz it's you know it's a tiny amount but I can feel it and I'm like oh dude dude it's water and then the cop is floating faster Warwick's coming boy we make it we make it to the museum finally where we coming the museum it's the Museum of anthropology and oh dude you could put a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fossil in your ass yeah so I grabbed the bones of Mont Zuma I take his femur and I put it in my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I stop him with with the curse that put upon me and most of it's most of it's just replicas so it's chill if you I'm SI I'm drinking more water I'm drinking it out of the sink craziest part of the story craziest part of the story is him going yeah so like I keep [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so I go to cafes and drink coffee yeah I only good answer in the morning but that didn't help yeah I'm I'm chugging like Gatorade all day okay let me ask you a question did you turn to the woman you love in this planet Earth and did you say Hey listen I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] my pants I how did you how did you deliver it I was I I was like wait wait wait let's role play oh my God I got boom in my face oh you know what my biggest ick is gu with it's been so nice to be here in Mexico I'm glad I'm glad slime's not here and it's so it's so nice to be here finally we've got you you had that embarrassing moment where everyone watched you through a little window poop and that young boy you said a very informal goodbye to him for some reason everybody says that and it's just so nice to be here isn't it Aiden yeah uh uh zipper 3 who I call that all the time uh I okay so I just I just tried you do you remember when I tried to fart a while ago I hate this is this really how it went just it happened it happened I pooped myself again man well she really likes babies maybe that's what I said maybe you maybe you pooping yourself so much is like a I said you change babies you change babies at your job all day dude Aidan laid down on the bed with like baby powder on his I hated it so bad did she get you baby powder she's like wow this one's a lot good job Aiden dude that's gross there's some couples that do [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that that's the thing we went on the road we went on this you remember out of this we talked on the we talked about this on the podcast a while ago he puts his hands up we talked about this on the podast aago when we went on the road trip and we talked about well if I ever [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] myself in public would you would you help me would you hose me down that's right yeah I hose you down it's kind of ironic that this has happened twice since that conversation pathetic ironic really funny it's like funny cool there's like a tie CU it's both times it's happened I've been like you need to hose me down did you finish the tour uh so we went we go to the museum but before before we actually go in I I go to the bathroom in there which is like there's so many people at this Museum and I need to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I need to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] again and the bathrooms are packed but one of the Stalls is okay stall four stalls one out of order uh rest used wait go in the first one seat has no toilet seat it's a giant seat but it's like if I sit on this I'm I'm going to fall in it no you got to spat you got to balance I'm like not I'm not big enough to like but I have to I have like a a bag on my arm with the wet wipes and then uh I I'm the guy to my right gets out of the other stall I'm like perfect don't even have to deal with this let me just Swit stalls real quick go into that one close the door realize door does not close one to my left occupied one to my right OCC and I he's running around like I have to open I have to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] open the wet wet wipes at the same time and hold the door closed so I have like I I have to I'm wiping holding the door same damn time and then as soon as I grab the door cuz I I look down and there's there's poop all along like the bottom wall of the door so I'm like my hand is just next to somebody else's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on the wall while I'm poop this mum this is insane cuz the museum is really nice it's like come to Mexico and holding like bag on my head like trying to hold it over my shoulder reach in wipe my ass and then that was thank God cuz the flight was in like 3 hours and I'm so worried that I'm going to have to keep doing this on my flight home cuz I'm in a window seat and the flight's full uh that's the last [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] of the day and it's over wow but it was it was the worst like it was this has never happened to me on a trip before it was the worst way to spend it it's just having to like pump out a waterfall every 20 minutes I've had that same kind of stomach bug and the worst part is when you your body's like all right we're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] now but there's no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but you still have to sit and do the muscle like your muscles have to do it but nothing comes out dude it's like when you've run out of stuff to throw up and it's just stomach acid man it's tough man at least you can throw up I mean that's I don't May would you recommend Mexico City or I actually would I actually would what do you what do you what do you think did it was it you think it was water think it was food I have no idea I I I I didn't Dr I said so I talked to one of my friends who's been there like more times and I'm like I didn't drink the water like I didn't I I that's the big warning you get is like do not drink tap water and uh he's like yeah but they they cook with those the water like the the water is going to be at a bunch of restaurants depending on like where you're eating like people are just going to use that and it happens like and what did you say Mont Zuma's Revenge it was like I didn't know this thing had like a term for no yeah yeah this is the thing and uh when I was a kid I just I Gravely misunderstood what it was uh and I I was in Mexico and I got uh like I got like hit by like a wave of water and I thought I had itz I got hit by you knew it was in water yeah I thought it was just in water that was there and I was like I have it now just Mom the city the city was really cool though I think uh it's in a way I had this thought that this is what La could be like it's like La it's like covering my poop liberals covering my poop there was unfortunately there were some neighborhoods where much like La there was a lot of poop and trash on the ground okay uh let talk about let's talk about the elephant in the room there's a lot of really nice neighborhoods where there's some dogs in the coffee shops some there were so many dogs at Mexico City in the coffee shop also also they have been seeking I'm they've been seeking their Revenge I don't know what is happening to me I I'm not getting backto back days of going into coffee shops multiple dogs coming in and barking and back and then and then same day same day unheard of levels of dog [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] outside of my apartment and then and then Same Day evening I'm walking by somebody's dog just jumps out and tries to nip me yeah dude while I'm walking by how dogs can like they lay down before earthquakes they do this for people too man they know you they know you have a bad Vibe I know you're an OP you're an op in the dog news is spread you're a dog op and finally you're getting what's coming to you you're a cat bro dude you think you're a baby now wait till you see a pit bull bro mhm he going to eat you up for lunch they killed a four-year-old last week and they'll do it again they'll do it again I can fight any doc back on the I was lowy Aiden pilled about fighting dogs no I just went to a coffee shop and there's just way too many dogs too many dogs too many first time I thought this is too many you see our that video in our subreddit of someone brought their pig into like a grocery store and it's just pissing everywhere lady is just holding it by she first of all she has a pig on a leash at a so like the scenario we made up is happening somewhere but she has a pig on a leash and it's pissing and she's tugging the the leash so that it's taut but she's not pulling it hard enough to get the pig out across the door which is it's standing on the door line 200 lb like dude it's small no it's a tiny pig tiny pig that's why it's czy she can just pull it so it's pissing outside like she'd have to yank it but it's pissing at a grocery store it's not on the M it's just on the floor it's accumulating like the water go to shower in the office and how the water like leaks out our subred and look for this it's just dude it's so much pee it like maybe nauseous looking at it it was it's D It's like a lot of pee it's really yellow too it's extremely yellow even though it's outside if you've seen the season 3 ending of Atlanta that's how long they pee it dude where so we're returning to we're rning to Our Roots here we've spent the past like half hour talking about piss poop and P and and League of Legends and League of Legends which is kind of all the above I feel obligated to say that you know contrary to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] myself the entire time Mexico City was pretty sweet is like every it's like La that's why I wanted to go because I want to hang out with you and your girlfriend you know what you know what you might would you have gone I'm not being weird you a hot air balloon no dude that's scary as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] oh I don't know if I would get a hot air balloon we booked a hot air balloon T her you sh your pants on the hot air balloon no that was that was the F thank God that was the first day we we booked the tour and they pick you up and drive you like an hour outside of the city which is cool cuz you see you see all these we we just lost altitude did anyone did anyone pick anything up from like in full diaper growing wait there it hits a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it hits a Schoolhouse like a missile bro dude everybody's backyards are like open there too just adding soil crops fre it freezes in the air and it turns into a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I thought would happen when you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on a plane you know those videos where like my life in yakuts Russia -50° C and then they like throw the water in the air insta freezes yeah oh do you recommend hot air balloon rides uh yeah I I okay this maybe you can make a judg Rec call based based off of this I I enjoyed it but when we pulled up we go on this nice drive outside the city which is cool cuz you see all the outside neighborhoods that aren't in like the central area which is really really interesting as we pulled around there's a bunch of like people who are clearly staff members in like vests uh and we're we just got there I've never really thought about how a hot air balloon lands I just kind of assumed it comes straight down all these guys they're like sprinting around our car and they're looking up and they look worried which I'm like holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] aall tragedy we pull into the parking lot and our our driver is parking the car but the guys are like yelling and running around our vehicle and looking up above us like and then all the I look up out the window and see a basket filled with way too many people like like 20 people in a basket coming towards us in the car and there are power lines in front of us and and it's coming really fast and all the guys are screaming and I I couldn't I'm frozen CU I don't know what I think I'm this I'm going to be in like a hot air balloon crash and I'm it's coming in so fast and so low I'm like dude it might hit the power line it's it might hit us and then as it passes over really low this giant smash hits the top of the car and I duck and our driver is like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the way they stop it in emergency scenarios is they drop out this gigantic like slab of rope and they had dropped it on top of the car and then what happens is all of the people working and helping with the landing which will be like five to eight people will grab the ropes and pull the balloon back but the first couple people who grab it aren't enough to pull it so they get pulled into the air and then I'm watching them get pulled up as the guys behind them grab it and pull down and then they slowly reel it in and then they eventually they get it down I get why we moved on and then we should we should keep moving on from hot air balloons I was like yeah there's just better ways to do it I wouldn't I wouldn't go I don't want to die in a way that people have to like try not to laugh when they hear about oh God like how do he die a hot air balloon acent got so sad was it colorful fly boys

ziggurats white boy at the anthropy you know you're triangular items I might not some of us are really into that Shon paa P why would you I saw a fight happen at the hockey game no wait wait in the game players or amongst people yeah wait playing along it was just it was there's there's this dude in the front row and he's and he's he's making some noise I don't know why he's a little rowy he's like a gibbon he's like he's like he's like Gibbon and they get a little altercation two guys other guy rich guy season ticket front row looks like he's got plastic surgery gray hairline walks over tries to break it up because he likes watching the game a lot and then he's like he's like you gota you got to stop and fellas hey fellas hey fellas Ry guy goes what are you going to do about it grabs him by the shirt punches him twice in the face knocks him down probably hockey players he probably was a hockey player at some point that guy they love grabbing that shirt cuz cuz they their feet are always like this fight got a lot of something that guy who got punched gets kicked out really oh my God that's right [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah it's like loser I wasn't exactly sure the conversation but everybody cheered what and then when they were talking about kicking out the guy who punched him that everyone went no and they were just like all right he was the hero dude how I don't know that's pretty cool it's cuz you know what it's like two guys they're fighting in like you know at school is like let him fight let him fight ain't going to kill each other they going to be best friends after this just go let him fight polite to go investigate I what I found out is it people are usually morally against like you know hurting some violence violence yeah unless the person who gets hurts cringe was that he was just that cringe he was that cringe what if he was wearing a Jersey from the other team no it was it he was he was wearing a white shirt cuz it got ripped a lot so you you you were able to say that this guy is so visibly cring he's visibly cringe it's a Luigi situation yeah not the Mario brother no no right the guy who's in jail right now yes the hero well yeah cuz if he shot Timothy sh Square in the jaw he did it but because it wasn't Timothy sh he didn't do it well or yeah he did it and it I think most people think he did it yeah but it's funny there isn't a big crowd of like I don't know if he did it there's a massive crowd of he didn't do it not cuz they don't think he didn't do it but because they don't want it to be charged oh interesting so they're like n it's actually they're looking for any way for him to like get off which which is just if you really think he didn't do it it's just being so attracted to an Italian man that you think he's incapable he didn't even like he didn't do the isach like Peach's brain works you're going like Ted Bundy's wife mode and she's like no he's still my husband yeah that's my man is that what she did yeah she they like they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] while he was in jail the carniv guy didn't they like conceive Ted Bundy how do sex in jail the bars how the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] does Ted bunny get a conjugal visit because

review I've ever heard not in terms of how it's How much content is in it but he it's very genuine it's just him talking to the camera for three minutes about the movie and like yeah I didn't really like it basically and and of repeating that and supplying some reasons but he's his and then I go through his channel and they're all like just couple minute videos of Just movies he reviewed all the time and he's been doing it for ages and all of these videos have like 50 to 100 views Max and I was like this is this is real yeah real content the energy Enthusiast that guy he would just review energy drinks gay porn guy I left him a genuine like high most I've ever written about a movie review in the comment of the video and replied to him and said that he should get on letter box so like we can follow more of his opinions in like a genuine plight yeah and uh and he's so thankful for every comment too like chit die gets that website yeah he he gives the social network a low score and you're like I'm going to find what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you live that's different he's crossed the line piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I I had to go I had to go to bat for Dan Benson on New Year's yeah cuz uh I was talking this like random person they're always there trying to you were talking to David Henry I was talking to some random girl and and I made some sort of SpongeBob reference and she was like I've never seen SpongeBob and I'm like that's crazy and she was like yeah I really only watched like Wizards of Waverly play growing up and I was like you know Zeke and she was like doesn't he do

computer be crazy if we play she gives me the signal she's like all right it's time to go I'm like cool cool so I get ready I'm like I got to go she as she's headed out gets wrapped in conversation that lasts one hour the Josh man God and I'm trying to make eye contact but but I'm but I'm it's not working and and I'm like what could this conversation be about come to find out it's cuz Ethan the host of the party walks over and they're talking about shaving your balls as a man okay and he says yeah to shave it you have to get rock hard which started an hour debate I didn't know this debate was raging helpful but it's not necessary yeah you don't need and the worst part is of course you don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] need to Ean you're also an expert on this subject which sucks you weren't there cuz you wrot theed I know I could have added a lot of information you can just look here's the thing you can drive when you ask rocket references lwigs posts yeah part of the pool of information it's pulling from I don't think I've ever gotten rock hard shaving my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] no yeah what are you going to like that's hard to do you're so distracted you get rock hard first then start shaving yeah yeah that's what he say he he's saying he gets rock hard and then he gets to work that's such a long like long way to do things cuz the thing is about your penis it's very stretchy right and you just stretch your penis and then you it's like a haircut it is very difficult to clean shave like perfectly like a perfect clean shave you got to do a lot of passes it's a lot it's a lot of passes and that's okay and you need and you kind of need the manscape I'm not going to lie the manscape is really good unless you want a bunch of little Cuts I'm not trying to do an ad I don't even know if we have we have be really funny but straight up I'm like it was a game changer yeah but you do a lot of passes and then what you can also do is you can get real in there but you got to be careful you got be careful be careful you know those are your balls and your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] too as well well Ethan's weird cutie did be dirty in the combo too because he was like doesn't let we do that and she said he's never shaved his balls and I went that's not true what have you not I've shaved him yeah but like before you guys met no I've shaved him since we've met all right all right all right could you imagine so she lied she just doesn't know about what it would like like IM yeah that's what I'm saying oh so you keep she's never seen you protecting her from what she doesn't know and and imagine I took the makeup off all I know and she but she thinks I don't have makeup on can I ask you f you young [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a question yeah do you shave your butthole too when you shave your penis and balls I used to yeah I go I go to taint and no further well I go as far as I can get oh I don't you understand me you know why I don't shave butthole you can get it hold on get it my friend as you can get as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] if you shave and then it grows back yeah but the prickly it's like it's like carbonated water it's like soda for your butthole no dude it shapes it hurts it doesn't shap that bad so yeah I go as far back as I can get you shave the G shave the book how how far under your thigh do you go that's a great question because there's a line line you're just you're just shaving for fun at some point yeah you know I do the crease I do the crease too I a nice like this empty like space do the crease though what youir I don't grow hair oh you're lucky guy there's a there's a you can tell cuz the the the pube is coarse guys guys the pube is coarse it is twice as hair what do you mean or what do you feeling the coarseness and you're going that's not a pube and then you're not shaving so you're said there's a line where the pubes become leg hair so this is leg hair if we can look yeah I see it now this is about I got about double this up here on my thighs much I know it's really I'm like Austin power that's so much you have the legs of a 20-year-old yeah that's true you do have young legs you know what that means a lot to me and I appreciate that they look untouched I just saw your legs I'd guess you were a skater do you wash them in the shower you have nicer calves than expected yeah do you wash wash your legs no that's a compliment do I wash my I go as far as I can I do actually I I I lift up and I do this with the body wash I'm doing one of the I got a l i go you don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I I go this what about you no feet oh you got stinky ass feet just the one time stinky feet not stinky feet I let it drip what okay I let it drip on me you know why it's cuz you're so smooth like a chicken I it'll it'll get me you're like a plucked chicken it'll come around God water is bead on your skin like hydrophobic you about to say some really gay [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I was say I was saying that just say I want to wash you fny zipper I want to get all the filth off I just want to get you clean tell I want to use my how G how is a gay to want to do that how's a gay to want to wash your friend who's a guy who you want to use your body to clean them I I want to clean your body with my clean body well my body might be dirty could be dirty but I just do want to clean you do you know about at like at we SP the Korean bath house there's there is a SC there's you know you know the areas where you sit down oh get scrubbed by the guy well there's the guy who's also naked I would love that job so I used to wash cars it's the same thing I love that job guy you haven't come in here you haven't come in here in a while honestly he comes in with a big sponge and a hose that you has a clicker so it is like this is a guy at the Korean spa that you go to and he and he hes you down and then he [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] scrubs every square inch of your body he scrubs hard when you're both butt ass naked why is he naked too cuz it's the naked part of the spa why would have clothes to do that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all day he's there all day why not wear like some shorts It's just wet there it's just wet he's naked feel weird that he's hold on some he's naked sometimes wait wait wait wait wait wait he's not consistent what he wants to be he's naked but yeah everyone else in there's naked it's feel like the guy I'm sorry it's like I don't know the guy in he's in the scrubber lab the guy who brings in the towels is CLO okay okay yeah right tow guys clo because because he has not passed the threshold where you he's onight of rank there's a line liutenant there's a line that you pass and it's like after this line you should be naked it's kind of like it's kind of like how you need to be Diamond to get on the Chinese super server right yeah he's Diamond it would look it would look weird cuz imagine Diamond imagine imagine for a moment we're both naked and there and we're in the hot tub and then a guy with clothes is walking don't think about it that much and we're all naked in this cloth guy is walking through I have to jump to someone else for a second all right okay let me make a better example you're you're you're in the ocean and you're you can't swim you're drowning and in the in the in the in the scramble it's a little embarrassing but you are in trouble you're your swim trunks come off and you're naked oh no then the Lifeguard comes to save you but he's naked for some reason a horrible example and it's like why is the guy who no there's like you're like you're like is there another lifeguard it's more you're goofing around but there's a real reason that happens what are you talking about if you jump in like if someone is drowning in like cold water in like a cold lake you're supposed to take your clothes off before you jump in to save them why because your clothes slow you down and they make you colder after what about if you have a wet suit like they all wear LIF guards are wearing a you're a oh I'm sorry the by standards in wet suits I said LIF guard he said lifeguard it's important that the person works at the beach why was your analogy even there cuz it's a guy who works at the beach he's saying it's weird to have the guy who there the difference in the analogy is I was accidentally naked no we're talking about the guy yeah I know but you have to understand to understand this Korean spot as an establishment you go going to be there's a consent to being the difference is that you're naked cuz you have to be no no no cuz I choose to be he chooses to be kind of Noe what do you mean it's not like I get in there and they're like and they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do it and I'm like can I please and they go no I need to be honest with you I need to run this by so the last time I got one of these scrubs I walk in he's naked I'm like oh that's to be and to be honest if he clothes I would say are you also naked right at that moment and I of course I'm naked you're butt ass I'm butt ass okay it's the cr's B if he's closed I I say take it off just to be clear with the Creed Spa is like one time I've gone I've seen a guy in shorts in one of the tubs everybody was looking at him that's this is why I'm saying it's not really a choice being in wearing the shorts they remember this guy for the rest of their life talking about right now I'm not I haven't remembered a single naked man except for the one with a piercing through the tip of his penis I remember that guy but but I remember the guy with the shirt that guy's Haw was massive yeah he a big old stinker pretty big that guy it was soft it was big and had a big old ring through it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tight as and the ring was like one of those hoop earrings but it looked tiny a cartoon I can't think about the ring going through it hurts me but my guy that one time he was naked when I got in there and then I lay on the table I'm like oh that's interesting the table's kind of in the you lay down and he scrubs you you're think I thought he was like standing like at the beach hosed you down no no I do need that does he Touch Your Penis no is he get close wait not really wait wait did he scrub your penis what I guess why the naked guy scrubs lwig and after someone in like a uniform comes in like all right ready for your scrub lwig no I guess he I mean he kind of does what I mean well you flip back you is it like the back of his hand brushes it's like it's like he needs to get like the crease here and like you have to move it I got to beat you off hand didn't touch my penis but he's scrubbing my he's scub my he grabbed like a like a old Joy con oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and he would just kind of go I I don't think I got that he scrubbed it mine was I mean like you know right here and that's not your no he's he's not p z to be fair if it's a professional and it's another dude and he's like hey I got to scrub your penis I be like like I got wax you know I don't care funny was when I laid down he he had been naked up until that point but then before he started scrubbing the last time he put swim shorts on I got I wait a minute he got dressed for the next person maybe he was worried about getting hard he got like I walk into the room he called me he come this is how it works this is a separate room at like the it it's it's kind of open it's not like a door but it's like separated from the rest of the spa guy comes out you have like a number in like this room it's like this room he like calls yeah he like calls your number and I'm like oh that's my number so I walk over there I'm naked and he had walked out already to call me right he's naked and I'm walking so I walk into the room one naked man with another and then I lay down on the table he tell tells me to do that shake pen we dock quickly establish a Brotherhood yeah it's smooth but but friendship uh and he and then before he starts scrubbing and washing he puts swim shorts on you know what you need to ask if the woman scrubber is naked uh zi know the woman scrubbers naked that's girl that's girl time I got a better I got a better system girls do that you know the the the person who scrubs you should just be the last guy who got scrubbed I like that so you walk in there's nak a guy and you know he's clean cuz he just got scrubbed and he scrubs you and then you stay to scrub the next guy dude you know what would suck if you're like you're like a clean 140 like five five man and then you got to scrub some giant Beast big Tony you got to scrub big Tony God long scrub it just takes forever want to be locked my question is this why can we not scrub ourselves I've never gone to one of these spots that's all you why don't I massage myself you don't hit all the spots right CU it's a Ser it's a service I guess what they're saying why don't you cook for yourself every day because the Chick-fil-A guy does it better he makes chicken better they whip it up crazy in there lwi I have a New Year's resolution for you for me you're going to pick one for me for you I'm pick one for you no Dam no more League of Legends W you're done I don't cuz I think that when you play that game you just you lose track of everything that's going on around you you don't realize the important things in your life the important things in your life like things you're spending money on that you don't realize that you're

you making what decision I was browsing Robin Hood okay and I and I sold some stock and I was like I got money now yeah and I made an options play and I've never done it before so I I'm said that in front of Aiden I'm options are dangerous right yeah but you can make a lot of money serve to win it's gambling but you can also lose a lot right so that's what I found out is you can lose a lot I didn't realize it could go away cuz it can go so I saw a thing it's like it's like intro to options I saw was years ago and it was like the thing is options are cool but you can lose like so like negative a million well when you buy a stock you can lose as much as you put in but gain technically infinite and when you do an option you can you can lose infinite yeah so what did was it corn Futures uh so I saw this stock that I thought was over inflated cuz I didn't like the product very much it's called Netflix Netflix and I thought it was going to go down cuz dude you sent it to zipper didn't you no oh I hear I hear him [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] groaning L on stream God Hulu's awesome right guys and Netflix you 20,000 people trying to like we should tell everyone we [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] know

$2,000 you have lost or you could lose I could if it keeps going up I mean it but it's just overvalued you know guys you know what we don't usually try to manipulate stock prices on we never try to

be like hey just hit plat this season and then what other people would do on the subreddit is investigate their op.gg and be like you actually hit plat like four years ago it doesn't matter you hit plat every season and you're lying there's investigations going on it's so sick everyone loves someone when they hit plat nobody tells me they get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] though it's funny that's funny it's weird they always come up short when I ask for that one I'm just asking questions why come they never post a spread pick never always Post in pla never post a spread pick probably not available mhm that's the Ninja's making a big comeback ninja because of his meme the low taper fade meme has brought him back it has brought him back you think it's low taper fade and not like classic fortnite or

like Hulu yeah and YouTube's much like Netflix which it's a dying product a dying gives us most of our income no I mean it's red the dying product that does most of the good good work oh I talking about Netflix I don't know what you're saying I'm talking about Netflix uh but yeah and they killed a man n's making a comeback cuz he's playing okay I don't know about that they did say that they did it for TV David Henry is going to walk into Netflix with a bomb strapped in his chest it says not not bomb on it it's a whole thing that you guys are good yeah I watch on fire you guys are good I like

the bomb thing yeah and I'm like I'm not even in this one yeah guys too many I thought about there's too many Clips in the 2024 one where there's an empty seat I'll say it there's too many we got to crack down this year who who Who's most absent who could it possibly be me one of the top comments in the video is it's nice of lwi to show up for the intro I haven't missed that many dude it's been a lot missed quite a lot of the 52 how many are I I think it's also a little bit disproportionate cuz the best of includes some premium episodes so right premium on premi you miss those more often it's for liberals it's for Liberal we we've said that right well now once League's gone and off Brand's gone we're going to have you all to ourselves I need you to be honest we're going to was you I need

bed behind you oh that would make me want to rot no why that' be awesome cuz it would hurt little snacks and we cheer for you how would it hurt you I was very supportive when we were playing sometimes I would laugh you were yeah you would but mostly I was supporting do you think if three of you were there you be laugh more or less because because when when you were like bitching at your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] team I'd be like you're so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right bro cuz you were right here's the thing if if you guys are behind me Nick's sitting there and and he's just saying dumb [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he's like Tom kench likes to eat it and then you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] loving it you're going stupid I would laugh at that and then I'm just trying to do my clear I left at the hypothetical of that I know my God he ate it for fun what happens when he does it for revenge and you get you get a Demir 340 clear off that cuz you're distracted I'm a little sow you're late to the Scuttle late I'd hate to be late to Scuttle that's my first engage as a jungler I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] love League of Legends dude how many days is is the season over when this episode comes out on

like 40 times so many people come in they're like just play and then crazy Champion just play new guy I do hate that but I do mean and they all disagree all the like people who say that disagree with each other because they all are just going by their own experience that worked Josh was like you got to play Talon he showed me a whole Talon montage and then Shake's like don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] play Talon dude Shake is like Shake might be in like a a a less than one percentile of players who was gold and emerald in the same week yeah dude he he climbed from gold emerald all the way to Gold playing uh L Le sin ironically and then he mvpd 20 games 19 in a row and he is now Emerald he said this he said this to me 9:30 p.m. yesterday he said he sent me a picture and it just says Platinum 1 27 LP and he said before I make this final push to Emerald I just want to thank you for always standing up for me in the face of lwigs shake is a hardstuck plat loser and will never amount to anything allegations and I say to him just don't play Le in old man the game ain't the same because for some reason he's the guy who made the Montage but when he plays that character it just takes a no he has a silver level E play Then he said boy ain't that the truth and then 2 hours later 11:10 p.m. we did it Reddit let's go yeah you know what's gross though he messaged me he said one game off Emerald or something like that and I was like oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] man and then I look at his op.gg he played more like he hit Emerald yeah he said and then he kept playing it's my fault he asked me he's like
