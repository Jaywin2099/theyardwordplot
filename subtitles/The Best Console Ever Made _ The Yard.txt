 No. What happened? It's the end of an era. No. What's up, YouTube? On his mic. You're pathetic. You can't even give a You had to dig that. That has to be like more poop than gas when it takes that long to get out. [Music] Oh, I don't like how how deep it must have come from you to take that long. Yeah, you had to dig that. That has to be like more poop than gas when it takes that long to get out. Oh, here he comes. Here comes our friend. Zipper, are we going? You fart? Here comes our friend. Why did you fart? Why would you think I did that? My m gross noises. My mic smells like strawberry. Yours. Oh. Oh my god. Mine, too. Oh, that's kind of cool. Mine smells like Did you fart on my mic? Why would I fart on your mic? Why the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] while he's chewing? While he's chewing. Why the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] would he throw your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mic? For strawberries on the mic. You put your nose up to it. Hey, wash your eyes out just to just to check. Come on. Come back. That's the best. Come back. No, it's okay. I don't come back and do your job. He's taking five. You're taking five. That's crazy. All right, Lwig's going to take five. All right, we're doing it without Lewig. I guess it's a premium episode. I guess it's a premium episode. Oh man. Is there anything I could say that would make him believe that I didn't do what I did? Uh, no. I think it's too late. I think he sniffed and we laughed. Yeah, we could have just pretended. We could have. It could have. Well, what if I made the fart noise with my mouth? The thing is, we had to reveal it to him because we didn't film you farting on it. I did. No, I'm saying he Oh, sure. It's on the show, so they don't know what we're talking about. No, that'll be the intro. It could be the intro. Oh, it's so gross for them to have gross cuz it opens. It's like imagine that's the first episode you found. It's just a closeup of your ass. So, I me and Archie developed a new way to censor things when we talk about sensitive issues on the podcast like Aiden's eraser of trans women. So basically we'll just fart or my farting. Equally equally damaging to society. But what we do is we make it's just like a donkey noise. Archie's dumb as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] by the way cuz I I had to sit with him and be like the donkey noise just isn't long enough for the sensor. I'm like Archie just stretch the donkey noise out. And he's like oh that works. I got to do everything around here. You guys see how to do everything with that kid. You're basically ending the podcast. I'm basically adding the podcast. RG, throw me the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] premier access code and send me to Wales or wherever you're from. Just send me to Wales. I don't want I don't want to dox him. I don't want to say where he's from, but it's not pretty. I We've said it. He said it every other episode. We've said it so many times. This guy. Yeah, that guy. This is real today, by the way. I got a new one. And nobody would ever [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with him in that place because nobody wants to go there. Yeah, it's either you you have to actually trade your teeth for a knife there if you want any sort of weapon. It's just it's just not. And they have to install it at the pub. Mwick, are you done? You play Cammy on my account? Oh, he's playing Tekken on your account. That's Street Fighter. Oh, sorry. Street Fighter. God damn it. No, the game with the guys fighting. That's Tekken. They're all They're all the same to me. Why is now Yingling's mad cuz my name on Street Fighter is Nick Yangling. Why? He's just like, "Why is his name that?" It is insane your friend's full name, dude. So what, dude? Everyone thinks you have a sick Cammy. Get out. We're recording the podcast. You do this to yourself. Get out. We're recording the podcast. You care the least is really funny. That's really funny. Also, now they think you leave after one game. Oh, you Wait, you lost and then left? Yep. No, they think Nick Yingling leaves after one game and that's our that's America. It's the country we live in. They think your Cammy is sometimes well played. Uh yeah, I didn't think farting under your mic would lose me LP, but here we are. Well, you should have thought about that. You should have thought, what would my revenge path be? And if I don't have a fart ready, it's that. Yeah, I guess it's the closest Sim uh activity for you to do. Mhm. I'm glad you're back because I have a question for all of you, especially Nick. I recall, you know, we played we played Nick ball last week and uh I recall the rules being if you didn't dunk the ball, you have to do your punishment. You have to do your punishment if you don't dunk the ball. Yeah. And it's interesting because when when we dunked it the first time, I was like, "Oh, Lwig, the ball didn't really look like it went through the hoop." And if you watch the footage back, Lwig's dunk does not go in the hoop. You missed. He just missed his dunk flat out. If you go back and watch the ball just doesn't go in. That's not true. And I It sounds like there's video deferring to the rules of Nick Ball. Is there zipper? While we uh deliberate, can you go to the episode cuz people timestamped it. Uh so if you scroll the comments a bit, people are here's the facts, man. We go with the ruling on the field. You You know what happens in an NBA game when the ref makes the wrong call and it determines the game? They go, "Oops, sorry." I think nickball is kind of like the game, though. It never ends. You think you play the game forever? Yeah, you're kind of in nickball at Yeah, I'm keeping a mental score on you. So, if I've ever dunked, I'm fine. Yeah, I think that cleans it up. So, I could dunk now. Yeah, but I think that would be fine. But where's the hoop? Where? Yeah, the hoop's gone. The hoop's right outside. No, it's not. It's directly outside. I see it right now. It needs to be It needs to be cut in half. The ring of the hoop needs to be saw. So it's un So now the dunk is no one void. Well, if I'm coming clean, I do remember in the moment totally whiffing that dunk and then everyone thought it went in. So I just went okay and I went along with it. I think I I as the creator of Nick Ball and a primary investor, albeit not 100%. Uh I think that if you fool Nick, you get away with it. I mean that's kind of the point, isn't it? Yeah. To fool Nick. You fooled me. Fool Nick once. Shame on him. I think actually if you would have called him out for it missing, I might have taken money away from you. Fool with me with pen andella. That's what I tried to do. It's people trying to jerk pet and tell her off. You have to make teller mode. Fool around with me. Fool around. You have to make Tell her he's like you're just making it. I feel like it's like fool around with me with just Teller. Just tell me to be there in a ponytail. It's kind of just teller. I'm fine with Pen not being involved cuz cuz you're just And you're just blowing the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of Teller. Oh my god. Oh my god. The labia comes in different sizes. Yeah, dude. When did you get put on to Pen and Teller? That's my pen. That's so interesting. That's how I got a good pen. None of your viewers know who Pen and Teller is. Everybody knows who Pen and Teller is. Not even a little bit. No, they moved on to Shin Limb. They don't know who Pen and Teller anymore. Okay. Shiny Shin Limb. Is Shin Limb an atheist? No, he's Asian. Oh, I got my I don't think you can be a magician and a Christian. No, you're doing witchcraft. Wait, you can't be a Jehovah Jehovah's Witness and be a magician or go go go to Christmas or get a lot. They don't get Christmas. They don't get anything. I don't think they get like love from their family. I Why would they need it when they get love from God? Problematic Aiden strikes again. What's new on the podcast? Why you all Why' you all just look me up and down? Did we all just do that? Yeah, you all just kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] absorbed me for a minute. I didn't do any of that. You came in today with all this all this energy and I was wondering why with all this energy. I came in with all this energy. I was just looking at you like the slob you are. Okay. I walk in with Nick. He's got a lukewarm coffee in one hand, a half eaten Italian sandwich in the other. You know what he's doing? Just looking at YouTube shorts. This is all fine. This is all the sandwich from today. The coffee from today. The YouTube shorts. Who knows when they were posted but enjoyed today. That's not fine. He is it? You just described a guy being a regular dude. This is Yeah, this is a guy who's doing YouTube with with food. But it's shorts, man. It's different. They weren't even open. Are you on the homepage? You're addicted to shorts. And I think that's the worst quality about me. That's the worst quality about you. Number one. I couldn't even What about your lack of being able to be vulnerable in front of your friends? I do that all the time. Let's rank Lwig's worst qualities. That's such a good idea. All right. Number one, he can't access his feelings on a whim. Oh, so I actually think him being addicted to YouTube shorts is worse than that. Can I say I think I access my feelings better than you do. Your feelings are but they're not real. They are real. No, I think you mask your feelings by calling other people's feelings not real. That's not true. I think you do that. But prove it. H don't need to. Prune it. Don't need to. Uh what do you think my worst quality is, Nick? Oh, I thought maybe it wouldn't have to come around to me because you got such a short list. Uh, okay, I got it. It is your uh centering in Call of Duty Black Ops 6 because brother, what the hell were you doing? He's looking for ants. That is so cool. He's like, "Oh, my gun's in the way. I know what I'll do. Pointed at the ground when I walk around." Is that like a pacifist? Was it a horrible game before or after Scump dropped a nuke? He didn't drop a nuke. He just had one. Okay. It was against the rules to use it, but he got a new Most countries do the same, by the way. This is This is apparent. Yeah, it wasn't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fun after that either, but it wasn't fun before. It It's probably the angriest I've been at video games in a while. Were you more pissed at COD than you were Street Fighter? Like, easily. What do you mean? I was like I was You were mad at Street Fighter. Oh, yeah. Like when I was playing Squeaks. Yeah. Yeah. But the anger ultimately was at myself and I knew how to resolve it. In COD, the resolving of my anger was uninstalling. Really? Yeah, you didn't uninstall. I bet that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] took like 30 minutes to It was not a quick uninstall or install. Are you sure you'd like to get rid of all your CP? All right. 900 GB and CP down the drain. Yeah. COD [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me, man. It It pissed me off. First off, the the UI is horrible. That game. Yeah, it looks like Hulu. It does look like Hulu and Hulu's UI is ass. But is the UI the reason that Scump's dropping a nuke? No, no. Scum's dropping a nuke because he's spent the better part of his life playing a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] useless game. That wasn't always useless. Still a little mad. Back when the Zany sidekick was playing, I was It's always been useless through and through, man. And And it carried I realized my anger carried over cuz I went to PSL and I was still mad at the game. Really? Yeah. I go to PSL and I'm like and I'm thinking to myself, I'm like, why the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] does Nick have a one sniper rule? Like snipers aren't supposed to be a thing. And then I was like, it's because this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and then I just see him mid with a sniper. And every time I see him, I'm mad. Wait, you made a one sniper rule and you get the sniper? Yeah. No, these are these are from Oh my god. You don't want to have I hate this. I'm getting mad. Call of Duty tournaments. Play with these rules. I know. I want to listen to the loud guy. I'm playing Black Ops 6 and I'm hearing the rules are no snipers. It's a gentleman's agreement. They do no snipers. Yes. And they're going to PSL and Nick's like one sniper. One and guess who gets to hold on to And guess who's the best sniper? You guys had nuke enabled in your game. You guys had killstreaks and thermal and all sorts of awesome [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Damn awesome UAV in our games. You want killstreaks? I would love a prred. Gotcha. So you don't want to play competitive Call of Duty. That's fine with me. Is a sniper competitive? Uh I to be real, you wanted to go there. I play sniper because if I play red gun, the game's over. What do you think about that? If I play red gun, you know, PSL's running into an existential crisis again. Yeah, because wealth wealth inequality at PSL. It was as bust in a tent outside. It was as busting as it's ever been last time. Like 20 people. Yes. 20 like enough for five teams. But they're all clamoring for the same thing. They're all going Halo. Halo. They all want Halo. And Nick's like, "No, kids. You're going to have another three Call of Duty games. Then you can get your Halo." So, I'm being This is what actually happens. After every game, this is real. After every game, someone goes, "Okay, this is fun, but I'd love to play Halo." No, no. Someone was 10 and he was the only person asking for it. And then when he when he finally got Halo, he played two games and left. Well, because you didn't start Halo till damn 10 p.m. this answer me this, Lwig. Is it like when you force everybody at the party to play Melee when they clearly all they just want to play Ultimate? They just like they want to play Solid Snake in Sonic. Melee and bless. I made I I put a vote out for what games we play at PSL and I said pick two and we're going to play two. We always play two. Usually I try to do COD and Halo. Last time we did Halo first, COD second. So this time I was like we'll do COD first and Halo second. This is very rational thinking. I just switched them and I picked the games everyone voted for. What if PSL didn't have COD? Nick would lose all his passion. It would die. It would die. It would die. No, I have fun playing Halo. Is is that the Liam running Mario into horror games of of PS4? Yeah. He's like, "All right, clock in. We'll play some Halo, whatever. I'll get a run going." And then he loads up some Itchio [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Look, I I took Walsh's head off with a quick scope and then I p I pulled up theater mode to show him and he said, "I'm not going to lie, that was pretty crazy." And that was the biggest rush I had at PSL. Halo is not the problem. There is no problem. So you said there's problems. No problem. He's the one who said it's not the problem. What's the problem at PSL? What's the existential crisis? I'm telling you, it's the COD. The COD because cuz I I do hate it. And I need to tell you, I did bring the hate over. You didn't hate Call of Duty at PSL before this. No, I don't think I did. But this is almost But now this Yeah, I've opened my third eye. Mechanically, Mechanically, the new Black Ops is not like Promod. Yeah, but this is like when a right-winger finds out Tom Hanks is a pedophile that can't enjoy Toy Story, right? That all did happen. Is it like that? It's like that. He's a pedophile. So So my question is, did you play black like did you get like biblically [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in the hole in in the Call of Duty tournament? Yeah. Yeah. We got We got bocked. And it was And it was by Sauno, who does diver play. Look how he's back. Look how far we go. He's back. By the way, Syuno is my guy now cuz he plays Diamond Cammy and he's nice with it. Yeah, he is nice. Don't say some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about my guy. No, no, he's just a diaper plate. He enjoys it. That's all I'm saying. We've come so far. We've come so far. Episode 2011 confirmed. It was It was It was basically has a butt rash on B. Diffusing with a butt rash. Basically, COD uh gave you team points for how well your team plays and then individual points for, you know, how good your individual KD was, right? It's not even Katy. It was like your score like your because it adds objectives. The game score gives you. Yes. And so there's certain game modes where you can just rack up kills. Okay. And so we're playing hardpoint. You're supposed to capture this point until it's 250. They stop capturing after 200 and it's just farm. It's just 10. Jake makes Syuno just mowing us down. And I listen to the comms after and it's gross. It's like it's like woohoo just got a quintuple kill. I'm shooting these kids down. Don't capture the point. Let's farm these guys. They're just turning you out on the same and all five of us are just getting turned out and and our vibes are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cut up. And then and then we go to SND slime, but SND doesn't have as many points as hardpoint cuz you you don't get to kill him as many times cuz we when we die, we're dead forever, right? It's like how it should be. Sure. And but instead what they think is they think, okay, we're going to lose this game on purpose and then go to a third game which is control where you can then go back to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] them. Oh my god, bro. That's So they decide as a team to throw. So they're going knife only. Here's the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] part. They still win the knife only round. No. And then and then How is that possible? Cuz cuz we're just like we're dejected people. Well, knife knife is G8 in in ProCod. It's so good that they don't use it, right? Okay. So it is pretty good. And and so what happens? But it shouldn't work. What happens is is we catch word of they're trying to do this. So we say, "Fuck this." And we kill ourselves. One se tech screen on the ground. We stand over it up screaming, crying drink. And again, I watch your POV. They start freaking out. They're like, "No, our plan's not going to work of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] them in the ass for 4 hours. Let's kill ourselves so we can [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the martyr." And then they start racing us to kill themselves. Just gifying this quarter mill tournament so they can [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] us as good as they want. Get more money. They want to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you how they want to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you. They want to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you. And we don't want to be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] We want to be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] first place. And I'm telling Sakuno, I won't put the diaper on. I won't put the diaper. It's like, come on, Lemick. I got baby powder. And And then finally, finally, we succeed in it. Our mission to kill ourselves. It ends. And guess which team outplaces us by one point. No, their team. The farming team. The farming team outplaces us by one point. One point. So they were dead last basically and then they were just destroying you guys. And they were dead last. And then yeah, they destroyed us for enough points to beat us in the whole competition by one point. Who was holding your team back? You think? Genius. Emmy, Agent, Squeaks, Tyler. I thought Agent was the COD player. Huh? I thought Agent was the COD player. Agent was probably our best in COD and you know, the 10th best COD player at the event. Sure. It is crazy to have uh Nad's team was crazy. I can't believe they didn't win because they had two COD players. They Well, they don't have Scum. Surely scums. No, they didn't win. They won COD. Oh, they did? Yeah. Yeah, they should win the overall. Hold on. Back up. You He said, "Who is holding your team back?" You named every team member but yourself. Yeah. Blood was leading the pack and they were all holding them back. Street Fighter. I got fifth. League of Legends. My Warwick 1v1 double lift like 10 times. I was a second frag in CS2. You actually did perform. You carried your car up as well. You were like the most stable. You might have been the MVP in the individual points. Tyler got 31 and I got 30.5. Wow. I was half a point off. But after it's like it's like Tyler me top 10 and then it's like 16 17 18 is the rest of my team. Yeah. So it was I Mortal Kombat tower like I mean you just blame blame. I drafted them. Okay. Isn't this your fault? Yes. Because you drafted this team. Cuz I could have drafted Landmark who was third overall instead of Emmy. Yeah. And that we probably would have had an insane team if I did that. Is Landmark a man? Landmark is a man. Yeah. He plays Tark. So if you have all five uh players as men, that means you're Oh, the woman was the problem is what you're saying. I'm saying the woman was the the horrible plate on our team. It's like a band, bro. If you if it's all boys in the band, you're gay. So you did the right thing. I'm I was and the agent wasn't picked, so there's nothing I could do there. But to be honest, I wouldn't change if I could go back. I feel like you would. What are you talking about? No, I wouldn't. You're so mad at COD. You're saying I think the vibes were so good. You wouldn't change either. Yeah. I think I sparked lifelong friendships and Tyler said he'd be my groomsman at my wedding. So, he's in the pyramid now. He's in the pyramid. Which row of the pyramid? He's obviously going to be at the bottom. He's carrying corner. He's just going to be It's actually going to be one at the bottom. It's going to be an inverse pyramid. Inverse pyramid. And Tyler just screaming the whole wedding. He's squatting all you guys easily and he has a Logitech headset on. Man, that'd be awesome. Uh yeah. No, my team was My team was kind of awesome. Is it over? It's over. It's done. It's done forever. That's so sad. It was such a fun thing as far as sponsored things go. And I know that that company particularly has issues with South Sudan right now. Yeah. But I think that was a pretty cool event. It's bad. On a map, could you point to South Sudan? It's generally, yeah, good enough for me. Okay. Generally is good in Europe. Generally. Anyway, that's cool, man. I'm glad. I think gaming's back. Gaming is backam until AT&amp;T Annihilator Cup and then AT&amp;T Annihilator Cup brought it back. I'm not kidding. Yes. RT. RT. I went to Combo Breaker. That's where gaming happens. Dude, I saw SJ Slams happening. Yeah. Yeah. And what I didn't realize is what I said about SJ Slam. Yeah. You Yeah. Did you see the clip? Uh, is it the one where you go off on Capcom and also say Jam slam? It's someone says, "Hey, would you do SJA slam?" And I said, "I'd rather slam my head into the wall and then kill Sjam." Let's go. That's fire. That's really really funny. Uh, so I don't think I'm invited. I No, you you think that, but half the FGC has me blocked cuz I didn't know who Akira Toriyama was. So, and I got into the second one. So, that's true. There's a redemption art for everybody there. Honestly, every time I see a fighting game thread on Twitter and it's like half the people I can't reply to, it's really funny and I'm like, "No, I actually like it." I'm like, "You don't We don't talk to each other. This is probably better for us. They're happier without me for sure." It's fair. Um, but yeah, I went to Comb Breaker. I played Tekken and I played Melee and Josh won Melee, which is really funny because it was like L. It's like Tab was like Henry L. And that's it. But hey, Zipper, if you want to show uh that picture I sent you, um I I played against a guy. He's a fan. It was This was in Losers and I played against Paul Phoenix. And uh let's just see the controller that he used. It took him out. Yeah. This guy beat me. He's playing on a Cheerios box. But that's so sick. And a small uh right inverted right hand left-handed leverless controller. That is very No one can just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sit down and play with that. The inversion's crazy. Yeah. So he he beat me in the video game and then he said I'm a big fan. Damn. Who was he playing? He was playing Paul Phoenix. Uh I thought he was Paul Phoenix. Me too. I thought he character. Yeah. He's like one of the first ones cuz he was like no Paul Phoenix. He was being kind of an [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with his Yeah. But I thought he was saying Paul Phoenix doesn't play Melee. Like that was obvious. I thought he meant me in Melee. I thought Paul Phoenix wasn't in Melee said. Yeah. Uh Yeah. Wait, does it rotate? Cuz that was not how Yeah. So the leverless part I think the Cheerios box is simply to rest his hands on. Yeah. Uh and so yeah, he beat me with that. So that's pretty cool, dude. That's like my garbage bag. We're the same. Yeah, you're the same as this guy. And uh that means he went probably 3-2 in Tekken, which is pretty hard to do uh com. But it was really fun. And I think gaming's back. Gaming's back. You had a good time at Common Break. Is there a lot of people there? There's a shitload of people. There's like 6,000 people. I mean, gaming is back cuz Supernova entrance already. Insane. What's it at? Oh, yeah. I don't know if I'm allowed to leak. They're out of Whoa. The guy who leaks. That's cool. You know what? I'm trying to We're trying to break the world record. We do for sensors now. We do donkey noise. You say whatever you want. Go ahead, say some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Um, oh my god, dude. Don't say that. I mean, I said say some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but going to gut you like a pig. That's fine. That's actually way better. I tell him that every morning. Me and Alex have been playing uh Xbox 360 like Call of Duty like Call of Duty. It's Xbox 360 summer. It's Xbox 360 summer. Everyone go buy one. We're playing I don't want to do that. Me neither. I don't want to play on an old console. Sign up for Xbox Live. Yeah, you know. Yeah, it's not bad. It is bad. It's not that not expensive. It's How much is it? It's But you have to pay for it. Like 10 bucks a month. You don't have to pay for Steam. It's kind of awesome. Does Xbox Live work for new Xboxes? Does it? Yeah. Okay. So, it works for the old Xboxes. Yes. They never change. You buy You buy the new one. You buy Game Pass core. If you have Game Pass, then you also just have You still need 1600 Microsoft points. You pay with dollars now. No [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] way. Wow. Okay. If you have the old co codes, can you use them? Um, no. The marketplace is gone. So, all of that money has just been deleted if you've been holding on to it. Sitting on that. I have an unused iTunes gift card. a $10 iTunes gift card that's been sitting in my backpack for I think nine or ten years and I just, you know, I don't use iTunes. The amount of songs you can get with that is just going down by the day. I know. It's It's inflating. It's inflating. Let's buy some McLemore. Mhm. So, we own it. I want hard I want hard vinyl More soft copies of Mmore. Yeah. No, buy the McLemore uh MP3s and then put Exactly those ones on a CD. Does Mammore still have a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up haircut that's hard to look at? Oh, like the like the white fully shaved sides with like the little on the top. He's probably lowkey balding. He look a McLemore current. Makamore 2025. I feel like he's probably got good hair. He can afford it. That's great. Oh, wait. He looks great. Wonder is awesome. Well, this is not new, is it? Uh, what's that first one? Second one. I feel like this is what he looks like now. Click that. Click that second one. There's some old ones sprinkled in. Yeah, that's a tour. It's a tumor poster. Dude, where is he at? He's going to freaking Where is it? Ireland. Dude, he lowkey looks like you. Yeah, he kind of looks like I was going to say he looks like Lewig. Really? You're dressed like that right now. And you look good. Both of you look the same outfit. You would woke up in some dumb [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that. Yeah, he probably freaking thrifted. What is it? Life goes crazy, man. We're shopping that one on lemonade stand. Dude, if a match got lit near your sweater, you would be incinerated instantly. Yeah, for sure. I'm hot. Go up like a Christmas tree. We'll make it happen. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do it. I want to I want to pour lighter fluid down your CGs. All right. Like a Viking funeral. Lock me in a cage and do it like that ISIS video. Don't bring up the ISIS. You don't have to make it about that. We could talk about We could You know what? We can talk about ISIS. I'm not finally an open forum to discuss. Let's talk about ISIS. Do you guys know what the lemonade stand did to me? Do you guys know about this? No. Dude, they interviewed Gavin Newsome. They interviewed Gavin Newsome and just didn't tell me that it made me like them all so much better. Yeah, I like them because it was it was it was the funniest thing he could have done too cuz uh they were both interviewing Gavin Newsome and introed as host of Lemonade Stand and they didn't tell Aiden about it. But not only did they not tell Aiden, Atri called Aiden to ask him if he could contact Doug Doug cuz Doug Doug was late for the interview. Dude, so they made Aiden do the work of getting Doug Doug there so he could do the interview and then proceed to have just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] one of the worst interviews all time. Was it that bad? It was just not worth your anyone's time. Is it was Gavin Newsome just like a Stonewall politician? Like couldn't say anything. I don't know if I'd describe him as a Stonewall politician. It's just the questions and the mediator were softball. I called it softball city. I like seeing it. The discord green glow around Gavin Newsome. Dude, that's crazy. I thought that was really funny. And him just being like, "Fucking plant the real clip thumbnail of something Atriarch loaded is him and Atriarch in a Discord call together. Gavin Newsome Atriarch waiting room 5. Just the two of them." Wow. I wonder what they chopped. Are you hurt that they left you out? Uh, like genuinely, no. Because this being so this is so much funnier than like like if I was in the interview, it would have been just as bad and there'd be nothing to talk about. But because they did this, it's it's funny and I get to talk about it forever. Equivalent we could do to hurt Aiden. It doesn't need to go back and forth. It doesn't not an arms race. No, I think I think there is some sort of equality that we need to match with a podcast with Wendover. Oh my god. That would be that would be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. We were on like Saturday. Yeah. And I call Aiden and he he's on town. I go, "What's what's the code? What's the code?" Cuz Sam from Wendover is here and you need to get him. He can't. He's like literally like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Sweden. I would be furious. I would do it in I would skip I would skip a lifetime. We take a trip. We take a trip. We're taking a train wherever we're going. We're taking a train from Malmo. And we're going to talk to Oliver. This is a good idea. And he looks like that. Monday comes around. Aiden's like, "What time do you guys want to do it today?" And and we're like, "Oh." We'd be like, "Oh, did we not, dude? We're in hell. We're in freaking we're in Sweden right now. We're freaking oops talking our dicks. You don't need to name me niche. No, we dead ass landing Goththingberg. You knowing like lowkey Swedish shitties pisses him off a lot. Yeah. It's like when you say I'm more Swedish than you will ever be. That's real [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Until you die. That's not true. It is true. If I can get Swedish become a Swedish citizen and live there. I'm more Swedish than you are. I can get Swedish Swedish citizenship tomorrow. That's not how that works. Wait, could you do it to flex? No. Your father's Swedish. You can get Swedish citizenship. All right. You want to bring it here? You want to dig yourself out of this hole? Uhhuh. Yeah. Second generation Sudin immigrant in Sweden. He's less Swedish than you. Second generation speaks the language citizen. Citizen. Well, South Sudan is next to Sweden. If he's a citizen before me, then yes. I But I'm saying I can get citizenship before you. So you would be more Swedish just because you can pencil your citizenship in before I count the date. Obviously like like like a baby is less Swedish than a 75. Do it just to spite me. You would become a Swedish citizen. So you could say that heard you. Yes. I we need to get Nick and we need to just do this for him. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This would be awesome. We are hatching a plan. No disrespect to Yingo, but he's going to go to the Sudin consulate thinking this is the Swedish one. Next thing I know, I'm going to South Shipped off. Yeah, that' be so. Say goodbye to the annihilator cup. Hey, pass me that Mando. I smell I smell like donkey [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Okay. Wait, let me smell your before and after. Let me get a Let me get a hit. O, is it bad in there? It's not that bad. His eyes are watering. It's not that bad, man. I I think your eyelashes are curled. It's like the Spongebob episode. Okay, he's going to put the Mando on. Oh yeah, dude. Put Keep it. No, sorry. You didn't finish. What? Keep Keep putting it on. You Yeah. Yeah. The thing about the Mando is it it can help you smell better. So, really cake that stuff on, man. Pick that sub. Yeah. Yeah. The thing about cool Mando, the cool thing about Mando is you can use it on your armpits, but you can also use it on other parts of your body. Like what do we have other parts? So, do you know the episode of Spongebob where uh Bubble Bass says there was no pickles on his burger and they pull his tongue out and the pickles are underneath. Now, imagine that's my use it on your tongue. Oh, and I see what you're seeing. And and imagine you're saying that Mando works on your guas. It It works on your guuchas very well. And you stretch any part of your body. How long does it last? Cuz my current deodorant lasts probably about a day. 3 days. 72 hours. Three days. Here's the thing. Here's the thing about me, Nick, too, is I I don't mix and match. So, I got a Mando for my nuts. I got a Mando for my feet. I got a Mando for my pits. I do mix and match. I just use it on my balls and my pits. That's also what I do. And that's the beauty of Mando. It go both ways. If But if you want to maybe not have one going all over, two Mandos is totally fine. Totally normal. Yeah. And the Mando starter pack is perfect for new customers like yourself out there potentially as a special offer for the yard listeners. New customers will get $5 off a starter pack with our exclusive code. That equates to over 40% off your starter pack, meaning it's already pretty cheap. I was dead ass thinking about Fuji, too. I use code the yard at shopmando.com. That's sop m.com. Please support our show and tell them we sent you. If we're going to share the stick, can we clean it after? No, I use it on one of my notes already. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hair. I like for my Mando. I like to use it on Lwig's nuts and then my pits without and I mix and match. That's your ideal. I'm just like you. I mix and match. That's called That's called the Neapolitan. Yeah. If you want a Neapolitan uh style Mando, you can go to shopmando.com and uh use our code. We'll see you there. I can't trust Yingo with that. He He misses the details sometimes. No, he did all that work to import your dumbass truck. He said it was the hardest thing he ever did. He nailed that. Yeah, but he Well, kind of. Okay. Well, here we go. Well, it nailed it. What'd he do? Well, there was some, you know, nailed it. He had to go to Arizona maybe five times. The truck got here. Yeah. And then I'm like, "Yay, my truck's here. I'm gonna drive my truck." And he's like, "Ah, don't get too attached." I'm like, "Why?" He's like, "Ah, bring it back to Arizona." I'm like, "What do you what for?" He's like, "Yeah, they need to work on it and I haven't registered it yet." I was like, "You didn't register it." He's like, "Well, it was really confusing, but I figured it out, so I definitely got it this time." Yeah. He couldn't spell register. And then he said that and then he went back and then he didn't have it that time and then he had to go back again. And then to to to straddle me on, he waves a carrot in front of my face. He goes, "You can pick the license plate." And I'm looking through and I'm like, "Oh, well, I want the vintage one." Cuz they have like vintage Arizona ones. And he's like, "I can't. That's gas only." They have gas only license plates. Well, yeah. And the the vintage one's only for gas cars, I guess. So, I was like, "All right." And I'm looking through. They have some awesome license plates. Like, they have uh anti-abortion committee. That's not the awesome one. What I'm trying to paint is that they That's bad. They have Look up all the Arizona license. They have like a hundred. I don't know. You can like just submit to some board to get a plate. It's like when you get like a picture of Shrek on your debit card. Yeah. Yes. You rolling up you rolling up in your K truck on the back it says take away a woman's right to choose like Arizona. It says mogul. Yeah. Scroll down. Just just scroll through this. This is all the plates that they offer. So many. It's like a hundred of them. Wait, California has like 300. Woman veteran's harder. I learned is that a lot of these require certain like white mountain Apache you can't get certain ones. Oh my god. You're telling me you can't get white mach actually. You have to show the DMV that you're a white mount of pouchy or or you have a purple heart and you have to show them you're from the Phoenix Rising Football Club to get that one. Yes, you need to show your Pearl Harbor. Dude, that's sick. Dude, leaving all the zeros if you could get it is pretty cool. Also, Pearl Harbor Survivor, but you're in Arizona. Yeah. Also, you have to be like those people are like they're dying. Like, it's that's diamond dozen. It's not many people left. Or I guess not diamond a dozen. A dozen. It's It's It's probably one dozen. Can we Can you look up science? So, this is the one I wanted. Can you look up science? You wanted F science. There you go. I wanted the Arizona science matrix. That is cool as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] No. also available with a disability symbol. There's a awesome uh for audio listeners, Arizona Science Center license plate, which is just a full ripoff of a Matrix. It's like the green code [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] background. You put your name. And I was like, that'd be awesome. Let me do that. But okay, they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lied. It's not available to everyone because if you have a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] electric vehicle, you can only get one license plate at all. Only one out of the hundred that they offer. If you have an electric vehicle, you can only get the cloud one. Can you look up alternate, bro? Just control alternate alternative. Can I put you on game real quick? Yeah. What up? Get a license plate for your regular car and just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it. Just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] put it on the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] car. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it. Wait, what are you saying? Like, put get a license plate for like your regular gas car. Just scroll down and swap which car it's on. Yeah, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it, Nick. That's just a crime. Like, it's one of the most blatant ones. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it, Nick. It's like the the police trooper cars can just I don't know what they're doing. You get the police pulls you over. You know what you do? You go out the window. You go this. You go. You go. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you. Dude, it's just the biggest in the wall. They like my dad was a police officer broke growing up and he liked that. Farm vehicles hard, too. I don't know how many Look up. Look up. Why are these so cool, dude? There's a thin red line and blue, don't get me wrong. Wa. Former prison. Prisoner of war. What? That's crazy. That's the one I was supposed to get, by the way. It's a historic vehicle. Horseless carriage. Wait, is that what John McCain was rocking on his car? Probably his old ass foreign console if you like work for the consulate in Phoenix. Yeah, they have so many [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] awesome ones. You need a plug bad. I know. So anyway, I'm stuck with [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ass cloud. If you can look up Arizona electric car alternate wasn't there. I think you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] capping. I I'm getting it. So you're going to see my bum ass license plate. Your your max top speed 50 mphk truck. Oh no, that guy goes like 150. That thing ramps. It would fall apart. Uh I mean it's terrifying when you go 70. Yeah, that's it. Energy efficient. It falls apart. That looks terrible car. I know. It's terrible. It'll look kind of cool on your car if you car. This is a bit of a This is a bit of a soy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] license plate. I know. I wanted Imagine you made the um the numbers on the Matrix one like one zero. I know. I was thinking that, dude. Anyway, I'm not going to leak what the plate is obviously because I'm not trying to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] have you guys run up. Or you make it red pill. Oh, and and there's never a passenger in it like a cyber. I was going to do no pill and do the anti-abortion one. It's clean. That's clean. That's pretty cool. Yeah. So, it doesn't make as much sense on the clouds, dude. I was at I was at Combo Breaker and I was thinking about it a lot cuz it's it's my first like fighting game tournament. Like I cuz I usually just go straight for Melee and Melee was kind of beat. But anyway, I'm there the whole time. people recognized me and it was like every it was I was like dude we're batting we're pitching a no hitter. There's not anyone who has made me annoyed at all until the very last day. I'm sitting I'm sitting playing Street Fighter with the this this young Jit Ali Hondal and we're both like platinum players and we're both just like playing. I keep thinking it's their name. What? You're playing with Ali. That's a guy. That is a guy. It is a guy. It's a real character. Yeah, that's a guy. He's in Brawl Pros chat. How did we [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this up? Yeah. I also thought you have a last name. Yeah. Why do you do last name like that? Uh so we're playing and we're like we we ran this like first to 15 the day before it was like 154 and I'm like I'm going to lose my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mind cuz I lost. And then we're playing the next time and he's like dude he's smoking me. It's like 9:0 and I'm just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] angry and I'm just it's on my laptop setup cuz they're they're packing up all the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cuz it's on Sunday and I'm just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and this two guys come up to me and they're like, "Hey Slime, can we get a picture just like right in the middle and I'm like I just want a mash rematch in the middle of the set?" No, it was right after. So they waited. So they waited, but it just says '09 like right on the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] screen cuz it keeps track and I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, let's get let's have a picture." And I'm like kind of pissy about it. They take a picture and and they they think it's funny. It's like it's fine. And then the guy taking the picture like, "Okay, can I get one after?" I'm like, "Yeah, sure." And the guy taking it, he's like, "Yeah, bro. Uh, you're pretty good at Street Fighter." And I got so mad cuz I'm like, cuz I thought he was making fun of me. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hell, bro. Interaction. Making [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fun of me. This is an error in baseball world. This is an unforced error on your end. And so so it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so I'm like, "You know what? You don't get one. You don't get a picture." No way. You don't get a picture. Your friend gets one, but you know. And I'm like, "You tell him that you he [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it up. You tell him he [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it up. Your voice cracking like this, too." I'm like, "You [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it up." I was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] playing. And I sit down and Ollie's like, he's Dude, he's funny. He's He's from Brawl Bros Chat and we met up at the thing and he's like really sick of Tekken. Um, but he's like 20. He's like a kid and so he's just seeing all this happen. He didn't know. He's like, "Yeah, I didn't know who Lwig or you like were. I just thought you were a guy from like the chat room, which is I'm like that's Yeah. But he's watching. He's like, "What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is going on?" I'm like, "Don't worry. I just want to play [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Street Fighter." And he's like he's laughing. He's like, "You're wiping tears." He's like, "All right, bro. How about this? We'll play this game. If you win, you have to take the picture. If uh if I win, uh you or sorry, if you win, you don't have to take a picture." Yeah. And if I beat your ass like I've been doing the last nine games, then you have to take it. I'm like I'm like fine. I'm like, "Yeah, he's he's he's cool." And we play and I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I played the best Cammy of my life, dude. I was doing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I haven't done all weekend. I was like hitting everything. I'm like reading him and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] just off of like pure [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] anger. And I just smoke the guy and I turn him like, "Did you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] throw?" He's like, "No, I promise I did not throw." And I got I took a picture with the guy. But yeah, a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I am a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Cuz I was like, you know, I got what I wanted. That's where you I would not take I You stand on that. You earned that. No, cuz you know what? It gave me time to think as I was just really What he wanted was to win a game. I just wanted to win a video game. And I finally got it. So that man got a picture. But one of them I'm very grumpy and the other one I'm smiling. It's so funny. Yeah. Uh but that was the only uh that was great. Con breaker is really fun. It sounds like you had no bad interactions. Oh, I was at the goddamn mystery game tournament, dude. It was sick. Uh, let me find the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Did you go to like a I can finish I can finish the end of my my Xbox story. Yeah. Um, me and Alex been playing Xbox Call of Duty 4 and you know there's only like one lobby up at all times for Call of Duty 4 now. So, we usually just play and uh just try to win the game because it's just fun to like go because there's no objectives or anything. cuz you always try to win with kills and uh you know the people who are playing Call of Duty 4 are like I'm assuming they're in their like late30s and they're playing for nostalgia purposes and usually we'll get like a lot of kills and win the game and I got a message through Xbox Live like like someone is like messaging me from the game through Xbox and I open it and it just says I think you've played enough of this game. What? And I have not gotten that out of my head. That's the most owned I have ever gotten. Why are they still doing that? They're sending that message. I know. I mean, because, you know, we're playing like an old game and getting like Yeah. like 30 40 kills and he was just like, "Yeah, I think you've I think you've had enough of this." Maybe they thought they could escape, you know, pub stomping in COD 4. Yeah, surely there's no pub stompers left. They just beg you to not play the game anymore. Yeah, Alex has been bringing it up like once a week. He'll just like laugh to himself and be like, I think you've had enough of this game. That's That's something that should have been like shown to Josh throughout his life. Yeah. Except Melee. I guess if they did that, that would have been It would have awesome. But he would just said no. Every time I see those messages, cuz I remember going to friends houses that had Xboxes cuz I never had one and they'd receive and send messages. Typing on that keyboard using a controller to frequently send stuff is such a pain. But some people would get so good at it. Such a useless skill, man. I think I could win a tournament of typing on that controller. Uh, so yeah, this is mystery game tournament. So, Combo Breaker has done this for like the past 10 years. So, every single round of the tournament, like every every bracketed round is a different game on a different system and it can be literally anything. So, this is a Sailor Moon fighter for I think the 3Dio, the Panasonic 3Dio. And it's apparently this isn't the broken one. There is a Super Nintendo Super Sailor Moon fighter that has infinites, but this is like one and uh this is my first round and I go on stream against my opponent and they pick Chibi Sailor Moon, which is the mini version of Sailor Moon. I picked regular Sailor Moon, which is the Mario cuz I'm like, you can't go wrong. It's Baby Mario versus Mario. You're you don't know [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Like, you it like they don't let you sit and play the game. They don't let you learn anything. All you can do is kind of like watch and it's just a fighting game with all the sailors and it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sucks. So, I lose this one, but you can just see some of the gameplay. Oh my god. Yeah, Chibi said this is an odd job sort of character because she's shorter than every single character in the game. But long story short, I figure out how to do a Shyukin. And uh yeah, the meta in these games is just find the projectile and spam it. So, she found the cat bomb. So, I'm like, "Okay, cat bomb." I'm trying to jump in. Oh, man. You're getting [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm getting [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] destroyed. But then I start sweeping. I got her in the corner, though. Yeah. We side switch. So then I found the sweep. Sweep's working pretty good. Okay, grab here. Okie situation. Yeah, I know how to grab. Um, but I find out how to do her her shyukin. So I start trying to do it. It has no hit box. So this that's later on in the game. But anyway, this was the whole thing. I lose this one. Uh, I win my next two. One of them was Garfield Cart. Okay. Garfield Cart. Oh, so there's non-fighting games in it. Yeah. Yeah, there's it's like racing games. Uh, the second game I played was it was like Capcom versus SNK on the game the Neo Geo Pocket. Damn. So, it was like an 8-bit fighting game. I haven't played any of these consoles. Yeah, you were saying [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I've never heard before which is cool. And then the I lost in Virtual Fighter 3 for the Dreamcast. Is there sort of normal popular games in it? Can you roll Street Fighter 6 or is it all niche stuff? No, it's all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Yeah, it'd be kind of dumb if you could. Yeah, but Josh So Josh went 02. Damn. Yeah, he he [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the bed. He was playing this dragon fighting game where like you're like jousting with other dragons. So, you don't all play the same games? No, dude. Even Even like the next wave is like nobody plays Sailor Moon again. Like even if you're just in the next wave, they don't like reuse the game ever. Uh did the show have under or uh lowercase letter aesthetic or is that just in this game? That's in the game. I don't know why they you're also fighting an arcade moon. Guess who got ninth? You're never going to believe it. Dreffen. Damn. And you know how he got knocked out? Two Wii remote games on the Wii. That's tough. Wow. What game? What game is even on the damn Wii that's coming up? Uh, I forget. I But he he explained Yeah, I found my throw. Oh god. So, what you f What I found out is you have to press two buttons. It's only three three buttons on the controller. Two buttons and then like a DP input to do your your special. Neither of us found this out. I also You're beating, bro. I'm not going to lie, dude. It's tough. Uh, I think it goes one-1. I'm just saying your face cam looks like you're beating. Oh, like I'm beating my dick. I was not. This was This is not what you'd want to be on screen if you were going to beat it. Yeah. Not chibi Sailor Moon. I think I'm just drinking the Sailor Moon half. It's just a Sailor Moon. It's just a Sailor Moon app. Beating off to this is worse than beating off in public. It's like, yeah, it was in public, but look what he was looking at. Uh, but yeah, it was really fun. But yeah, uh, also who knocked out Dreffen? Jailey. In a Wii mode game. Oh, isn't that crazy? This is like a dream that you had. I know. It's like and Dreffin were playing Sailor Moon Fighter. Yeah. Uh, yeah. Gaming's definitely back. Gaming is back. Oh, TK Breezy was also commentating. Is that funny? I think uh I think this is why everyone should go get an Xbox 360. We're not getting Xbox 360. Unless you're ordering one on your phone right now. I got to call I got to call. I'm gambling. You're gambling? I'm gambling. Gambling? What are you gambling? I'm gambling. She's in Vegas. Hello. Sorry, I'm on the pod. You're okay. I just want to know what money line you want to bet on. I don't really know what that means. I'm like the money line. On sports on sports bets, there's different lines. Oh, I'm just betting that the Indiana Pacers win. Yeah, there's a spread straight, but like look, you can bet by certain amount of points. You just want them to win or that's it? I'll do the two and a half point thing. Yeah. Oh, okay. Okay. You're such a tourist. That works for me. You're no degenerate. Okay. Goodbye. Thank you. Uhhuh. I don't think the Pacers are playing today. No, they play tomorrow. Yeah. How much you put in 10K? 4K. Oh, she owes me 4K. She owes you money? Yeah. Cutie's owed me 4K cuz I had it cash and she needed to like pay rent. You need to go like something awesome? Yeah, she pays rent. You charge your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rent? Oh, not to me for for Deco Deco. Oh. Oh, they charge her rent like you charge her rent. Yes. Women should not be charging rent. No, women shouldn't pay rent. What do you landlord's a woman? Landlord woman. Huh? They shouldn't also be landlords. Is this controversial? Land lady. Let's take away women's right to be landlords, but also also they get to rent for free. What do you say? Women all women live at the rent fair from now on. And it's 24 hours a day every day of the year. It's like a It's like a pasture. Yeah. They live on the They live on the range. They live on the range. They get all the grass they want to eat and all the ale they want to drink. I don't I think we This is going to work. But I still get to eat the turkey. All the ale you want. I get to eat the turkey. Limited cups of ale. But you can't be driving. No dip. No suffrage. No suffrage. No cars. No suffering. No rent. No rent. No suffrage. No suffering. No suffering. Who would operate the machinery at the rent fair? Cuz we shouldn't let you know. Oh yeah. I think well I don't know about the machinery. There'd be a pet Nick Iningling zoo. Um wait Nick In like roaming around like a Stegosaurus. Yeah. Yeah. Which he just learned about. Um and you and all the ladies can line up to pet him and and they get to teach him a fun thing about math. Yeah. Feed him gummy worms. Feed him gummy worms. Just the worst theme park you've ever been to. There would be the uh the hit the sexes tomato. It's just Nick and he's just saying [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Cool. Say about and if you miss it goes like haha missed me. Uh.70 cents or something for the dollar. Y they said something really sexist. Remember the yard carnival? Uh yeah, that was Nick really loved this idea of doing a carnival and I remember being like I'm your friend. I'm going to support you whatever you want to do, however you want to live your life and be. Not how he acted at all. But I do think a carnival done this ever. A carnival is weird. I always thought it was weird. It's okay. I thought No, you know what? I thought it's weird that he wants a carnival so bad. So bad. I I wonder if I wanted it so bad. I think it would have happened. You wanted it bad enough to talk about that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] carnival. I guess I was desperate. Talking about hungry for it. You were so hungry for it. You didn't get it and now you're mad. Yeah. I guess I'm just fuming. You're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't think you're fuming. I just think that you like carnivals more than a normal person. I don't think that's true. I think it is. I haven't been to a carnival. Like I think about them. You keep up. Wait, how many of us have gone to the rent fair? I've been fair first time though. First time though. Oh, dude. Oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Rare is not a carnival. Carnival. It's just ye old carnival. No, it's much more racist than a carnival. That's not a carnival. That's not a carnival, by the way. It's not. There's no rides and there's no carnies. I'm not a car head. It's a It's like a sexy sexy carnival. Sexy carnival. Sexy carnival. All I know about the Renf Fair is they they strut you up and then big breasted women feed you drinks of alcohol. Mhm. And they they say, "Gub, glove glove. You're drinking it all so good for mommy." They do that. This all happens. They do that. And people love that. And the beer, I have to imagine, is more expensive than like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Dodgers game and warm. No, it wasn't. The drinks weren't that expensive. Oh, what? Not the beer, but I saw the prices. Okay. Oh, they weren't that expensive. No. So, you took notes of the details at the Renaissance Fair.

Are you are those some of the people that are participating? You become a professor. There's professors and then there's students and the professors were the bigger streamers and there's like a dozen of them. Extra family got in. Who would you have taught? Come in your pants in your sleep. Uh 101. Yeah. Or do you think I would have talked about that? What else you going to talk about? I have men knowledge. I thought you were going to say I have menitis. What the hell was that? I have men knowledge. You caught me slipping. But I have a lot of know. I'm very smart about the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] What would you teach? Real [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm challenger Twitch. Okay. Challenger. That's I'm challenger. He's challenger. I think you were a challenger in a plumber season. Were you challenger in season 3? Surely all the professors at streamer you are challenger in streaming. I I don't know. You can't be a professor at streamer. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ch I don't know what to tell you. I'm challenge masters. I'm not m Kill yourself. I think you might have have some ELO decay. I There's no ELO decay, man. No. What does it mean if you went and played Dota for [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] four years or whatever you were on YouTube for? What the hell does that even mean? You know what I'm saying? What I'm saying is you went and played a different game. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What? You played a different game. He became divine at Dota. No. That's so impressive. What do you think I'm doing now? Uh, you're splitting your time between two games. Yeah. What two games? YouTube and Twitch. But they're all It's not the same. It's the same game. You're separating the games. It's the same game. I'm saying you quit Twitch. You started working for YouTube. Yes, that's not just it's not just League again. Challenger players are like a dime a dozen now. No, but the the the the streaming is the part that you get the rank in. There's a challenger in streaming. Yeah. It's not like it's not like like maybe you those are regions, right? Like a challenger kick player is not going to hold up to a challenger Twitch lobby. So you're on like EU East mogging everyone on YouTube besides Speed. Yeah. In the Japanese women. Who do you think will be the first streamer to stream on like Netflix? I think that's coming. That's probably his dumb ass. I don't think it's coming. You don't think that's coming? Sign that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] And by the way, there there I would argue there's already someone streaming on Netflix. Jake Paul. No. Wait, who's already streaming on Netflix? Uh John Melany like a show. What does he play? He does a live stream. He's just like a live stream show. Mario. He does like a weekly live stream show. Yeah, but I mean you know what I mean. But that's how they'll do it. I mean they're like you know what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you mean? going to do it like dude. Imagine Netflix chat. Oh, it' be the most insane normie. It'd be like it'd be like stream east chat spelt out with emoji. They're not going to do a chat. What they would do is just the emoji. So like you could just click the emoji on your remote and react, but you're not going to have somebody who's like typing out like, "Wow, awesome gameplay." No, dude. Oh, they'll be they'll be pasting slurs with the Black Mirror should live stream on Netflix and it should be like thoughtprovoking and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. And here's what it does. Black Mirror, it just records you watching and streams and it's a cycle and you can react and you're the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You can [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] react and you're the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you're the entertainment. It's like the big black mirror and the black mirror is the phone screen. Black mirror, you're jerking off to porn. You know what I found out when someone someone told me this is that I might have said this before on the pod like uh you saying the mirror is your phone screen is is that dating simulators they instead of using a black screen when they change screens they made it a different color that is not as reflective so that the person playing didn't see themselves in the monitor and get taken out of the sex fantasy. Is that a YouTube short? Because it's a great YouTube short. No all yours. Okay, just roll before rock hard during the transition. Yeah. And then you see yourself your unshaven mug. We should make a dating sim. And you have to get Aiden to hear you and go on a date with you, but he's distracted. Dude, it' be like $5. It's like a silent voice about the deaf girl in the anime, but it's Aiden and he's not deaf. Mhm. You think he's deaf? That's the plot twist. The whole It's a 90minute movie. 87 minutes. You think this boy's deaf and at the end he just goes, "What?" How long are dating simulators usually? A long as hell. Really? Yeah. I would say like 10 plus hours. 10 hours of dialogue. I mean, it depends how quickly you read, but yeah. Do you have sex in them? Depends. I would argue uh on what dating sim you get. There's definitely a lot that have. So, I thought it depended on me, like my performance. I would argue the more popular ones don't. Is there one that's only But yeah, it's like the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is like This is the easiest game to make. It is just like a bunch of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] multiple choice little if statements. I had to mod [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] into my favorite dating sim. Now with [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mode. I had to learn C++ to add [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to my favorite game. Getting the expansion static art. This is easy. I want to do that. I'll do that. You want to do You want to make one or play one? I want to make one. Do you want to make one about us? Do you want to make one about butts and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I want you. It's butts only. Okay. You got that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up haircut, right? And oh, one of the one of the dates can be take Aiden to get a haircut and it could go horribly wrong. It's not that bad right now. It's not great. I don't love it. Yeah, I don't love it. Why don't you care? Honestly, you should have to care. He's on top of the world. It's a lot of effort. No, he's not, bro. He was a mess at basketball. Oh, how does sleep? This boy was throwing me passes like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] drunk drunk man. That's it. Drunk man out there. I was a little wasted on the court. I went to Dr. Noodlesam's engagement. Then I'd fly back early. It was Dr. Noodle Slams. You didn't say that. Dr. Nlam. Yeah, he got engaged. I heard it was a rager. I flew to Wisconsin. People do like drinking. They rented out a wreck room in Wisconsin. They're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] chugging be in at the bowling alley. Crazy. I said, "Dr. Noodle Slam, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] inspect my feet. Inspect my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] feet here cuz I'm actually concerned about my ankle still." What'd he say? Uh, he said, "I don't know. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sprained ankles take a long time to recover." That's the problem with Sam. He's like, "I don't know. Sometimes it's just it takes time. It's all just Sam. Every doctor is like that. I don't know. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] come back when something's really wrong. We were getting driven around. We were doing kind of the Milwaukee neighborhood tour and uh my friend Ian who I used to live with is Sam's friend from high school and he is also the guy who did a bunch of the dev work on our Minecraft server and he drove us everywhere. So we're like going stop at a new parents house, going stop at new parents house. Hm. Sorry. Go ahead. the yard Minecraft server. Yeah, I've heard of it. Do you think you're cool when you like this? The one that you played on. The one that you play shouldn't ask questions. That's my bad. My bad. My bad for asking questions. Is it? You used it. My bad. Where little Josh follows you around. Don't do the Kelby face. That's the Kelby face. Kelby does that face. It's so You're so to the side. I I hate the Kelby face. Don't do that face anymore. You're ugly when you do it. Oh my god. Your face is going to get stuck like that. It's okay. Dude. Uh, I don't. And when you get in the car, uh, the same song loads every time, uh, which is fortunate sun every time you get in the car because you have to have one song saved on like actual iTunes to get it to recognize an iPhone because it's so low or so old. And literally every time we got in the car all weekend, which is probably about 20 times, it fortunate sun played. Give me two seconds over and over. [Music] Okay, that that so every time you get in the car, whatever you're talking about, it's immediately punctuated by fortunate son of axe volume. It's not a the worst song you can ever That's a good get in the car song. We're about to go. We're going go on a road trip. By the 50th time you're playing It Ain't Me and it's it I'm losing by itself. That song was in the in the airplanes in Battlefield Vietnam. The game shipped with songs on it and you could put on the radio while you're just like gunning people down. It was pretty cool. They couldn't They could never do that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] now. They'd have to call They pay [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] $7 million for [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Rolling Stones to gun people down. No. To put Rolling Stones. I saw that too. They pay so much now for that. Well, it's in CP now, which is just the currency. It's the currency in Call of Duty. It's call points or whatever. Is it actually? Yeah, that's what we were con points. We did a whole bit about it. You on that one, huh? I'm just learning about it. I blocked that game out of my mind. I hate it. You can't hate it that much. much. You know what? Why don't we play on the same team? Dude, I got a good idea for next PSL. Okay, Halo only. Oh my god, it's Halo night. That is crazy. Why did they make the letters so big? I You don't even read Call of Duty on it. Just funny. Do they They kept this in the game to this day. Yeah, it's a it's a crypto. You can use it on all sorts of dark websites. If you want Nicki Minaj, you must use CP. Yeah. With your CP, you can enhance your experience. Use their CP to unlock tiers and instantly access epic content. I wouldn't call it epic. Yeah. You guys get mad at us when we do this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bit. It's right there. It's the greatest game in the world. You giant letters on the coin. You want me to not make jokes about CP? That's why I hate this game. I got I got into CP a long time ago. Things have changed. I hated it the moment I saw it. You disgust me. This stuff isn't bad. I'll tell you what, we were playing together. Agent said, "Get some CP. Get some. We're all going to get CP." And I said, "Agent, no. I refuse. I'm not buying my foot down right now." Oh, if if Halo only PSL happened, would you put that real gun in your mouth? Here's a very There's just like There's like seven COD games and there's one [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Halo game we play. We play Halo, be 70 people. Why can't play in different Oh, cuz it they weren't on 360. What? Uh the other co the other Halo games. Halo 2 is on 360. We could play wasn't two on I just said that sentence out loud. Three 360. But it's just like you know there's only one to play on. Why do you play FIFA? Oh 360. Do those count? Yeah. Reach like the Fire Emblem one where you're moving units around. No, no, that's Halo Wars. Halo Reach is just a normal Halo. It can't be. Otherwise, no. Otherwise, they would have put a number. Millennials or zoomers, they think it's Alaska. For me, then I think it's Reach. Then I think it's ODST, and then I think it's maybe Wars was before ODST, maybe some something like that. I didn't play Wars. Reach is electric. When I was in uh middle school, uh all the allowance I had ever I had ever gotten, I put into my wallet at once one time, and it was like all in there. My wallet was like I probably had a few like hundreds of dollars in there. This is before after you kiss a girl. This is I hadn't spent any of the money I'd ever been given by my parents for like any sort of whatever. I was saving it all and uh I owed a friend at school money and I brought my wallet to school and uh I thought it looked so dorky like the the bulge in the front pocket cuz like phones in the front pocket like kind of weren't even a thing yet and so I put it in my back pocket and uh I lost the wallet. You got pocketed and then someone stole the money and I was so sad cuz I was like all my allowance at once all went away at once. That was 4K. That was OC allowance. So I I could have bought like a like a Miata. Um and you lost your vertical license. Then maybe like my school ID. Um but if I just had a thinner wallet, like potentially a Ridge wallet. Oh, you you I could have had it in my front pocket without it being so bulky. Nah, man. Cuz I've seen these Ridge wallets. How much can they really fit? Be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You want You You want to know? 12 car up to 12 cards plus cash. And that's without all the bulk. I bet it only comes in like black. No, it comes in over 50 colors and styles. I can't even name I name seven colors. I can't do that. But aluminum, titanium, and carbon fiber. Wait, those aren't colors. They're materials that it can be. And there's RFID blocking. So, you know, if someone has like a flipper zero, they can't just steal your credit card. It has an optional air tag attachment. All products have a lifetime warranty and also free shipping plus 99 day. What does that mean? There it is. Free shipping plus 99day returns. So, you can 99. Well, because a hundred is just too many, Lwig. Anyway, you'd hate to let it go. You gotta call it somewhere right now. Just in time for Father's Day. Ridg's having a huge sale.

I'm just saying there's probably land games on the Xbox 360 just treasures in the ground, but you just want to play your little shooty game cuz you're a little violent guy. No, I don't go. You know what? My only thing I do is I go into the PSL Discord just to roast Yingling. That's it. We got to get you out of there. You know what he said the other day? He [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Yingling is like, "Is there a way to mod Halo 3 to be 60 FPS?" I've never talked in that chat ever. I see it. I instantly respond, "Yeah, man. We'll just duct tape two 360s together. Will that work?" And you know what's funny is Nick says, "Unfortunately, Slime is right. You can't do that. There'll be some AI mods scaling. That would be gross. This is just like you. It's crazy that Halo is in 30 FPS on the Xbox 360 because Call of Duty 4 just isn't. Yeah. Isn't that crazy? Halo Reach, bro. Let's go to Reach. You're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You love to reach. I love to reach. You reach? What? I like to Yeah, I like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] reaching, too. What about What about Wars? Ew. It's always the game. It's always the game we're not playing that Lewig says. That's the answer. That's the reason. That was a common theme with you. It's like, oh, well, if we were just doing it the way that I could win. And Nick is like, yo, let me [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hold on to this game and keep it alive till I die. No, Alex is also holding on to it. There's two of us. Yeah, it doesn't make it more powerful. He's just following your lead. This was like his idea pretty much. Okay. PSL. Yeah. Really? He was like, we should get a bunch of Xboxes and play like old COD. I was like, yeah, I'll do all the work and you can have the idea. I well I I thought it was your idea to be fair until now. It was a mixture. It was a mixture. But I I think it's fine as it is. I think I think you guys are big uh crybaby complaining. I thought it was all you cuz I didn't really know Alex like clocks in at the thought factory. No, he loves thinking. Yeah, thinking is easy. One of his favorite things. That boy is a real thinker. Oh yeah, he loves great mind. But when it comes to say edit something or open a program that manipulates video and audio, he's like Oh, I won't do all that cuz it's not good for thinkers, bro. He's all Wait, so he's all an ide? He really is an ideas guy. I think he's cut his teeth on being an ideas guy his whole life and he's got awesome ideas. He's the Bobby Scar of What's your genuine complaint? Whatever he does. Pizza, man. We got to move on from that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Um, yeah. Okay, that's fine. Salad night. Over the course of this episode, you've said that the one thing wrong with PSL is like four different things. I'm just saying, bro, it's it's pizza every time. is not good for you. Can I talk my Well, it's pizza once every two weeks. So, it's like whatever. It's not that crazy. It's all easy cuz you don't have You just never thought about sweet green. Families of four are doing that for movie night. Sweet green. Can I just Sweet Green is ass. I I like bowls of healthy food. Sweet green is ass. It's on every film set. It tastes like absolute [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] garbage. There's no flavor in the entire bowl. It's so bad. I don't eat this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] So, I I protein bars and eat them. It's like the most boring, dude. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like HelloFresh. Not HelloFresh, the other one. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] factor meals taste much better than a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sweet green. Boring. So, you want salad night at PSL? I want salad night. I'd be down for salad night. The problem with with I think things I guess we get like a big bowl of salad. Just a huge massive bowl of salad. Everyone walks in and just picks it. Let's get Kelby. Huh? No. Where do you get like a big bowl? Oh, we'll make it. Are you up? Butt up. Yingo. Yeah. Be one of the greatest toss and he throws it. No, I just toss it with my hand. You don't want him to make it. There's a whole cucumber in there. Yeah. I didn't know I had to cut it. You said put a cucumber in. It's all the ingredients you told me to put in. There's a tomato. There's a cucumber. What else am I supposed to do? Where do I get a thousand islands? I have to call Mr. Beast. Okay. Never damn change. This week, Kelby Kelby asked to to go back to Montreal for a while. He's looking for some time off and he asked me and Ledwig in a chat on Slack if like this is all good. I'm the only one who responds to the chat. Yeah, L doesn't have Slack installed. I say, yeah, no, that's not true. That's part of the problem is I wish that were true because then there would be a consistent explanation to why he doesn't reply. I just don't reply to that sometimes. I don't reply to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that don't need me. But Kelby messaged this nated you. No, it didn't because because Kelby says like, "Do you either of you have an issue with like me going back to Montreal for a while during this like lulling events?" And I say, "No problem with me." Lewig doesn't say anything. Few days go past and Lwig is messaging me about something. I'll say really important. It's it's sensitive. And then at the bottom of that section of messages, he said, "Also, Kelby can't go back to Montreal. uh we need him. And then below that message puts two up carrots and says serious. So I want I want I want you I want you to imagine I've read this and this is off the back of something that is super serious that he's introduced the conversation with which is rare to begin with between us and our DMs and then signs it off with that a few days later days later. So in my in my head, oh this is urgent. Like I have to tell Kelby he might have already booked his flights. And I message Kelby. I'm like, "Hey, uh, I don't like I don't have a reason. I'm sorry, but Lwig told me you have to stay. Don't book the flights to Montreal." And then Lwig replies to me like an hour later and says, "Sorry, Kelby thing was a joke. I can see how that would be confusing." What? What are you serious? Literally a directional arrow pointing to the message that says the word serious. When I there was two carrots. You should have known it was a joke. Dude, you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You're so cool. No. Okay. I think you're so awesome. Can I Can I now say my side? I would love your side. Possibly be. Kelby was next to me. Kelby was next to me and then I was like going through messages and then one of the messages is like, "Are you cool with Kelby going to Montreal or something?" And then I just replied, "No." and next to Kelby. Did Kelby see it? Yeah. And you guys had a bit of a laugh. Yeah. And we had a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] laugh about it. So now it's we're gonna go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with Aiden. And then I told Kelby, "Don't ask me. I don't care. Just do your job." Mhm. Right. Then you hit him. And then I hit him. Yeah. And then he went, "Okay." You spanked his bottom. Now he's on a plane somewhere. God bless his heart. I hope he doesn't come back. This is so awesome. He's going to come back. What? Yes. I hope he's going to come back because he has work. He has to work. But he can work remotely forever. I mean somewhere in person be here for the weekend. Like what? Face to face with a client like this weekend. He can do that elsewhere. That's not how I'm at the Sherin. He doesn't have to come. I don't like when he's here. Why you being [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like No, you don't. Yes, you do. He's really into Taco Bell right now. He stinks. Yeah, I stressed him out so much the other night that he was here at 11 p.m. eating McDonald's. He broke me. Yeah, Lwig broke Kelby. This was eating Stinky. He sent me shattered he sent me an essay. What? I shattered that boy. Good. Good. I took him down from the inside. Okay. And I saw him the next day and it was like it was like let I crushed him. The other night we were we were up here. It was pretty late. We were up here and like the whole building shook like something struck it. It didn't feel like we thought maybe it was an earthquake, but it felt different than an earthquake. It felt like something hit the building. And I said I literally was like, "Oh, I'm going to go on the roof. Maybe something fell from space like it's Elen Ring." And I didn't see anything. But it turns out I was right. You were right. What? Cuz the SpaceX aircraft like fell back from space and it it like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] went boom. Yeah. Or whatever. Like all of LA heard like a giant boom. But it was my neighborhood app was going crazy. But it wasn't on our roof, right? It was just like the sonic blast or some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Felt like it weapon. It blew up, bro. It blew No, it just like re-entered. It wasn't a mistake. It was like It like re-entered or some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] It was like I don't know. It Oh, it was the Was it the Sonic Boom? [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't know. No one knows about science. None of us know [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about dick. But I just I was interested. So, I was interested. I had something to say in the first 15 minutes of this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] show about a red dick. Oh, yeah. Gavin Newsome. Do you do you think he's got a more tan dick than normal? 100%. Yeah, you think so? I think it look like a dog do. I think it's got like the rocket. It comes out. Yeah, dude. Speaking of dog dick, Swift was pissing me off last night. Dick dog dick. No, not with his dick, per se, but just as a as a as a dog. I was going to say as a man. As a man, he's Swift is neurode divergent. Yeah, 100%. And a minor. Cutie's out of town cuz she's hosting the red carpet for the AMAs today. So, she had to go to Vegas. The porn thing. What do you think that stands for? That sounds the adult movie association. American Music Awards, right? So, she's hosting the red carpet for that slime. Oh my god. Cutie interviewed Asa Akira. That's so cool. I thought she did the And uh she a hoodie that says rich off dick. Yeah. And I was staying behind to take care of Swift to do my whole thing. So, I'm doing my thing. He's great the whole day. Pooping great, eating great. And then we go to bed and he realizes I think he was hoping that Kudu is gonna come back that she's not gonna come back. Sun's getting low. Sun's getting low. It's bedtime. She's not there. And so this is uh this is 1:30 in the morning. Oh my god. It's like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tornado siren. [Music] That is swift like non-stop howling. This is 5 in the morning. Oh, dude. That's crazy. Wait. And it continued through that whole time. Wait, which one's getting the best head, though? [Laughter] Number two, Malone. Yeah, he basically just nonstop cried for her from 1:30 to about 11:30. Did he tire himself out? Yeah, he's sleeping all day, dude. That's the whole shift yesterday. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] boy. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] boy, put some food in my bowl. I was so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mad at him. I've never been that mad at him before. Was this last night? Yeah, that's why you came late. What if you just like picked him up and gave him like a shake? I didn't do my hands. In my experience, you kind of just shake poop out of him. He just excites. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, Aiden's been down this road. I tried everything. I tried I was like, "It's okay, buddy." I tried petting him. I tried getting more firm with him. I go, "Swift, no more. We're done now." Yeah. And And he just tanked it all and just howl cuz when he howls he's kind of deaf. He can't hear anything. Dude, we got to toughen him up. Maybe we send Swift to one of those like um like Andrew Tape men's camps or to West Point. He's 14. He's not going to West Point. No. No. He can fight Andrew. 14. Yeah. So, you think he's too young? He like he like uh does push-ups and crawls in the mud and then has like a fancy steak dinner and then they they talk about like why women are crazy. Yeah, I think I mean that would help him. I mean he's definitely he's he's overly attached to cutie. Mhm. But I think he's just going to be like that forever now. I think a YouTube short sending my dog to Hustlers University and it's a 14-year-old American Eskimo and then they just send back like a 2-year-old German Shepherd. What is your dog? This is the same dog. He's too uh too soft. Needs to stand on his own four legs. We should give We should give uh we should start using like research chemicals on Swift. See, we can fix it. Can I pick the chemical Swift? We give Swift ego death. LSD. Yeah. A little [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] eye. And he and he sees himself being born again as But he's an adult. What I realize is cuz I took him for a walk and when everyone sees Swift, they smile. People smile when they see that dog walk on the streets. He's a cute ass little dog. He's a cute little dog and he prances when he walks. So, I'm just watching people and their faces all lighting up and you know he can make a thousand people smile but only one person makes him smile. Wow. That's it. Lwig Agrren. No. No. Cutie. You know who doesn't make his ass smile? Artosis. No. The uh the the Starcraft Brood War player com does not care for Artosis. You know why? Cuz one time I was tasked to take a swift when you guys were both out of town and I you guys were like, "You can sleep in our bed." And I'm like, "Okay." Cuz Swift doesn't he he chills out when there's someone in the room. But what I didn't know is he hates the television on. And I fell asleep to a Brood War game and then he stayed up all night and he was just shaking in the morning because of Artosis and Tasteless talking about an old PC game. Yeah, that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] scares him, bro. Yeah, he's not fully caught up on that tech. Yeah, he didn't really like Rush's aggressive Terran play style. No, he thinks that's like kind of breaking the game right now. Why is he like that, man? Uh, why is he like that? I, you know, nature plus nurture or some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't know. Fed him a lot of grape soda as a kid. Yeah. Too much sugar. Yeah. Too much freaks out. Yeah. I've been getting chocolate like once a week for a year or so. Well, that makes his bones stronger. Dude, he ate onions the other day. Cutie freaked out. Yeah, it was actually bad. I was on call. Dude, I had to goo when I heard that I was like, surely we're overreacting. And then I Googled, "Can dogs eat onions?" which is one of my funnier Googles recently. And it was like no. Yeah. Like for real. It's like for real it's bad, bro. It's like no. And then it's like what happens? And it's like Yeah. In 4 days they die if it's too much. Yeah. That's pretty days. Yeah. It's like some weird enzyme that breaks down how their body functions. So it doesn't function normal. So it's not immediate. Like it's not like they Has Swift ever had sex? No. Well, that's No way. That's probably the issue. God, we got to get Swift some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Have you owned a dog? Yeah, multiple. Did your dogs have sex? Um, you're suppressing. I don't So, I don't think it's it. No, cuz my dogs like they didn't need it cuz they lived such a sexually forward lifestyle. They were getting They were kind of experiencing sexual things through daily life. Like what? Yo, like what? What? What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you talking about? What are you talking about, bro? Did you pick some peanut butter on your balls? [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Yeah, I like the peanut butter on the balls. Monday. peanut butter and peanut butter on and lapping up water is kind of sexual. I think getting Swift laid would should be top priority. We can hold a pageant. I don't think Swift's got balls. We do a lineup of of white women and Swift. Oh, Swift. Three things. First off, we all know who he'd pick. Second off, he does not have balls. He's not as sexually active or cannot be sexually active. What? You can be sexually active. Dogs without balls, hump, pillows, and puss. He does not hunt. Does he have the penis? He's got the pissing part of it. Baby, that's all you need. He's only got the piss hole. You need the other part, too. Do you know what a Unic is? Yeah. Do you think the Unix's got nothing down there? What do you think they're peeing out of? Yeah, but they can still They can still use it. Not mental boost. No penis or no balls or both? It can be either. So, it could be anything. But mo but most or no balls. Do you know a lot about Unix? No. Do you know a lot of them of Unix? Yeah. Swift. Yeah. Yingling. I was going to say that was an on boarding. You actually if you're going to PA for a lot of you, you do have to get cast. And he was like, "Yes, I distractions." It's so It's so he doesn't usurp in any way. Yeah, there's you can't be challenged. You don't want any counter sexual energy in the room. Yeah, he'll take me down a notch. That's why Swift's cast. I think this is a good idea. Really? A dog pageant? A horrible idea. What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you talking about? I just went through the reasons why. No, it's not for white women. It's for dogs. Yeah, it's for for the dogs. This still wouldn't work. He cannot have sex. He can have That's so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up to say. Dogs [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] They don't. Make it a bumper sticker. Yeah. Neutered dogs [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Neuter dogs [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] at the bottom of your Arizona license plate. They just don't. Uh, incel dogs [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] It says IDF. Okay. Wait. Make stickers and we put them on the back of cars all over America. Yeah, I went and worked at the IDF for a few years. M's like, "Yeah, the IDF is a perfectly normal organization that I'm proud to support." Can you check Can you check zipper if neutered dogs can have sex? Cuz I'm pretty sure this is like case, bro. They can't. Don't ask AI. Pull up some videos. That's the whole purpose of neutering them. No, it's not. It's so they don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bust their seed. Yes. Neuter dogs. That's AI. Okay, let's find a real source. Maybe scroll down. Yes. Cat Cattle Dog Public Train. What is that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] picture that they're doing hot dog style? They're doing a hamburger style. Yeah, obviously. Yeah, but then they say they don't want to. Wait, can I ask you guys a question? We did. Me and Aiden did the advice show and someone wrote someone wrote in about how they uh they saw their dad's like Twitter like like homepage and their dad was following like like busty naked Latinos and they saw what their dad beats to. It's awesome. Yeah, I was kind of looking like DJ Nintendo's follows. They were they were debating if they should have a talk with their dad because all of their like a lot of their follows are porn and they wanted they wanted and they but they also follow their real life and they were like should I tell my dad that other people can see who you follow? Yeah. How old is the person asking this question? I think they were like 24. They were 100% you tell your 25. Yeah, they were 25. You know there was it's an awkward conversation. I got to say I saw I saw what you were looking at that you thought was private. Blah blah blah. But one thing that they said in the writing was um there was a uh a naked Latina with a big ass spread eagle. That's what they said. And I said, now when I when I think spread eagle, don't make this an American thing. Anyone can do this. Oh my god. Not where I was going. What animal are you picking then? A spread quiz. Okay, hold on. No. So when I think spread eagle, I think about it this way. I think I think they're like sitting down with their legs are open. This is Spread Eagle. But they wrote very focused on the size of the ass. I mean, and so can you spread eagle from the back was me and Aiden's question. Me and Aiden called it spreading eagle or sorry spreading hamburger spreading hamburger because we felt like spreading eagle is a thing that we know to be the front. Is it a matter of perspective? Um yeah, because they're still spreading eagle. Uh kind of you're spreading hamburger and you are observed from the back. You're spreading eagle. Observe from the back. We cannot really see your butt. You're sitting on your butt. But if you're spreading butt, then you're like on your knees. But I suggested to Nick, I said like some poets have said, as so fat, you can see it from the front. That was a good point. And that was that that honestly was probably the part of the conversation I got the most confused. Is eagle vagina men's ready? I said I said that's unclear, right? Can men's ready? That's unclear. That's why we came up with hamburger because hamburger is clearly your butt and then we said a spread hot dog when you do it in the front. Spray hot dog is clearly the front. Why don't you guys assign two foods when the original one is a beautiful gorgeous animal? Right. I mean I hamburger makes sense, but like why not? So you don't like that we're bringing food into the picture when we should be balancing out the perspective with another animal. A beautiful Latina spreading hot dog on the timeline. Okay. Spread uh spread bear. I like that. Spread. I'm a little bear spread. No, cuz it's a double entandra that doesn't it's too confusing instead of interesting as opposed to spread eagle. If I say spread monkey, what do you imagine? That is the pain the the whole I think spread spread monkey. I feel like that's it's interesting how that it's like it's like uh Kiki and Ba. It's interesting how we just kind of know which one we're talking about. Spread monkey. Now a monkey is it's something that is hanging out when you talk about the the monkey. It's like you got your whole monkey out. I think it's like a Bonabo situation. Like the ass is like it's Wait, which animal? Which animal? So if I say if I say spread a monkey, what's the monkey with a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] big ass that sticks out? That's the probiscus monkey. Yeah, that we don't call it that. What's the name we know? Wait, no. Probiscus monkey. Weird about it. Baboon. It's not bad. That's a different guy. That's what he's thinking. One of the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up nose that we don't call. Those aren't bad. I'm thinking about Rafiki. I'm thinking about too many monkeys to refer to for this. He doesn't He only knows cartoon monkeys. He know he knows three monkeys. Can you look up the probiscus monkey? Oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] It's a totally different monkey, man. It's a mandro. So you're telling me there's more than one monkey that has pink ass out? That's a probiscus monkey. That's what I'm rocking. That See, that's a totally different monkey. God damn, boy. He looks like Squidward. Yeah, he does. He looks weird as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Get to know the proboscus monkey. I'm not trying to know who this guy, dude. Thumbnail face. Look at that. Can we put in the thumbnail of this episode? Yeah, sure. Wait, he's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in the next one. Say that. Oh, yeah. That picture. God damn. That's what Swift needs to be doing, bro. He's busting down. Hamburger style. The question is, is the monkey in the front spreading rat or are they spreading monkey? Spreading rat is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. Oh man, he's cute, dude. They look like Star Wars creatures. They don't look real. Where do these guys exist? Probably somewhere [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] It says Malaysia. Oh, somewhere cool. I met I like Gibbons, man. You really saving the Malaysian audience there? Clutched. If he shouts out if you're listening from Malaysia, and I'm not kidding. And shouts out if you've seen a probuscus monkey. And if you're listening from England, kill yourself. Y if the top comment is somebody from Malaysia that says they've seen a probiscus monkey before, I'll be happy. That means we have reach. It was episode 200, you guys. Nick Ball was 200. They were tail. Dude, his balls look like licorice. Oh, his nose is so much more impressive than his so hard. Can you look up uh Can you look up lens cleaning air pump? It's so good. It is crazy. It looks exactly the same. His dick is firetruck red. It's crazy how much bigger his nose is than his dick. You're right. It's crazy. It's exactly the same. Oh man. Yeah. This is for when you get dust on your camera, you can blow it off. In that uh in that sketch we did with the monkey. It's actually coming all full circle right now. Uh I asked I asked Slime to handle getting the grenade and he didn't do it. So I took one of those and I cut it up and that was the grenade. Yeah. By the way, I did do it. It just got ordered late. Like it didn't arrive on time. That's not I have I have toy grenades. Yeah, I think that's not I just didn't check the shipping date. I just wanted I just wanted to be clear. Grenades were sent to the house. That's all I'm going to say. I hear what you're saying. Grenades were sent to the house and they were dangerous. Yes. But if I'm saying bail me out of jail, you got 24 hours and then 48 hours later you're like, where you at? Well, then I I would talk to the cops and I'd say there's six grenades in my car right now. What do you want to do? What can we figure out? What can we do here? Like what can you do for me? 200 up. We had a lot of fun. Yeah, it's going to end soon. What? What? What is this whole thing, man? really whole thing, bro. He's going to spirge. You You've been tapped out since episode 100. That's not true. That's not true. This guy This guy don't This guy don't even [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] have to end. This guy don't even care about the show anymore. Yeah, he cares about PSL. If we needed bomb PSL to make him come back. I've always been here. I I'm I'm here to the bitter end. You are also here at the bitter end. Your We spot shorts. Amen. No, man. I'll steal more of these. We don't I don't want to. Then don't you want to do episode 400,000? I think we'd be Come let's be brave. No, you want to do episode 400,000. You know that we would make it that far. You know that we wouldn't make it that far. You want to do episode 3,000? We would be dead 400,000 a week. Would we make it if we could if we kept doing podcast at this rate? Not even when would we get to 3,000 at 51 podcasts a year? Do you just divide by 50, bro? But I'm 52. It's 57 years. That's episode 30,000. We can make it. Zipper out, I guess. My dude, my my Swedish finally came in handy. I I got subject. No, it didn't. It did. You yelled at some minorities or something. Racist. I said, "Don't come to share. Don't touch my baby on the sidewalk right now." And uh don't eat my baby. the same the same CS scam that I told you guys about the with the Ukrainian kid and uh I decided to indulge. I join a Discord that I've been invited to again by a different group of people on Face It and immediately the same thing happens. It's like three European guys and I ask one of them, the one leading the conversation, I asked him where he's from. He says Sweden. I was like, "Oh, that's interesting." And uh I was like and then I asked him why do you live in in the US but in Swedish and then the call goes dead silent and then they hang up and kick me out of the Discord server. Let's go. You [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Julia Roberts them. You pretty woman. I know. I know. I finally got to use it, dude. That's so sick. Also, you got to stop joining Discords, man. It's It's fun. You're going to get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Yeah, I own them. I mean, my metam mask completely drained, but but they felt stupid. They stole your worthless NFT apartment. I didn't click any links, man. It's It is weird how this keeps happening. You You keep getting like hit up. Oh, it's cuz your inventory is so sick. Yeah, but I think it the fact that it's happened within the span of like four face it games. The awkward thing was the guy who like orchestrated the scam just loaded into the next face game I played. Oh my. So, I was there, dude. Aiden was barking at this guy. Yeah, it was sick. Oh, cuz I I was like, "Hey, man. Hey, what's up? I saw you blocked me on Face It. That's interesting. Uh, what's going on?" And and then everybody else in the call is like, "Why are you like so mad at this guy?" And I was like, "He just tried to steal my entire inventory." I was like, "Why don't you tell him about it, buddy?" And then the guy starts to speak up. He's like, "Fucking idiot." Like he's saying in like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Russian accent. Uh, and and then and then I say, "Uh, and then I just told him to kill himself." I told him, "You should kill yourself, man. You tried to steal all of my entire inventory. You're a degenerate [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I hope you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] die. And these like these poor three other guys on the team, one of whom recognized me as Aiden from the yard. No way. And I just plowed forward cuz I was like, you just tried to steal my entire inventory. I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I you shameless [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] idiot. He was barking. Remember when remember when Aiden had that whole argument about what's worth like saying you're going to break someone's arm or or telling someone whatever it was? Yeah. And now he's telling someone who wanted to steal his mask. took off to kill themselves. Do you want to do Okay, we'll we'll end the episode here. Oh no. What happened? It's the end of an era. No. Fat fat. Fat fat. Fat fat. Fat fat. It was foretold. It was foretold. Yeah, it was foretold on the Reddit. You made it on the subreddit. People said you were going to break your chair. Dude, it's clean. It was foretold this week. It's clean through. It's like broken. It's like a soup bone. I think it was already broken. It was just hanging on by the metal broken broken break. I think it was you. That's Dude, maybe that's a sign, dude. Maybe it should be done. Guys, we're going to wrap this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up forever, man. We're all done. Oh, don't tell me your tummy. What were you saying? Well, we'll we'll end on this. Uh I had a bit of a crash out on uh so there has been a there's like a scam call going around. Maybe not even a scam call, but it's like in SoCal, people like a bot will message you and call you and say, "Hey, are you uh" They say, "It's Amy." It's always a women's name with a local roofing contractor. We're offering roof inspections at no cost. Want us to check yours? I get one of these like every week and I hate it because it's like they're getting my number from some sort of place and and and spamming me. So, uh, one time I tried to call back or or I one time I responded and say, "Please stop contacting me. I hate this." And they just don't respond. But I get another one. And this time I was like, "Hey, Amy, super interested. How do I get into contact?" I was like, "All right, I'll have my partner Dan get some info and reach out soon." Uh, and then I I got a message or no, sorry, I got a phone call, but I didn't pick up cuz I didn't see the call, but it's a real number because usually it's a call back bot. So, I said to this number, "Hey, thanks for reaching out. If you ever if you or your spam bots ever contact me again, I'm going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] find you. Do you understand? This is not a joke. I am insane and angry with a lot of time on my hands. please respond so you know so I know you read this message they didn't respond and then I tried to call them and the uh the number didn't work but it's really annoying it's like the ninth time that I get that that message so I just wanted to talk to the human who is running this gam call that's really cool have they reached out since they haven't okay so so far you're good but they never responded to let me know that they I've saw the message maybe they're just scared maybe they just wanted to they want it out maybe they didn't want maybe they're really offering a M I I my roof is fine anyway.
