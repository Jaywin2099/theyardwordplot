I'm pretty sure this one's right. &gt;&gt; Santa heard that was supposed to come out in March. &gt;&gt; Where's motorcycle video? It will be out before D and D. No, &gt;&gt; I'm down for a bet. Loser comes to this podcast in full clown costume and makeup. &gt;&gt; It's Catchy the Clown. &gt;&gt; DN D race against GTA 6. &gt;&gt; Right, right, right, right, right, right, right. I can only pray one day we truly hold up to our word and release D and D. Guys, don't look now, but I think Nyall Red is a little charmed by me. &gt;&gt; Is that true, young man? &gt;&gt; Everything I've said, you everything I've said, you've giggled a little bit. &gt;&gt; And you should understand that m is not something you want to hear. Just boy. He's not sure if he's going to be hard to get this &gt;&gt; on the stage at open. &gt;&gt; Well, well, hold up. We are actually still in LA at the yard. &gt;&gt; We're at the yard, dude. &gt;&gt; And also the also the chairs that we sit in, &gt;&gt; they're in the picture. The logic's a little bit weird. &gt;&gt; Yeah, they're behind us. &gt;&gt; You have to suspend his belief. Well, finally, welcome to the yard podcast. Nile red aka Nigel. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; How you doing? Get a little closer. We need boom. &gt;&gt; We need you to eat it Nigel. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Eat it like Nigel. &gt;&gt; Eat it like Nigel. How do you speak different in your videos? &gt;&gt; No. Until it's red. &gt;&gt; I mean, maybe. &gt;&gt; Like, if you're talking to your mom, are you like &gt;&gt; And now I'm going to start doing the dishes. &gt;&gt; I definitely don't do that. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Wait, can I show you my my Nile Red impression? &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; So, we cuz we've met one time, but I get your shorts on my timeline a lot, so it feels like we've met a million times. Um, and I've been working on a little Nile Red. actually most of the millions of views you &gt;&gt; so so I wanted to make a Red Bull but my balls were in the way so I had to push my balls out of the way so I could drink the Red Bull but it turns out I need more phosphate to put it into the Red Bull so that it better &gt;&gt; how is that &gt;&gt; is this I've never seen one of your videos is that how &gt;&gt; if you take a dial red video and you just put that whole audio over it I two million views &gt;&gt; I would say Um, four on 10. &gt;&gt; Four. &gt;&gt; It was so &gt;&gt; Wait, this happened to you. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Well, we're jumping right in. There was a You have two channels. Yes. &gt;&gt; Nile Red and Nyall Blue. There was an impostor. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; And I forget the channel name. It was It was &gt;&gt; N Green. &gt;&gt; Nyall Green. &gt;&gt; You guys don't know this lore. Nile Green would make videos almost like that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Like how you Is that fair to say? &gt;&gt; Yeah. basically like poop videos, &gt;&gt; but he used AI. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So much more lame. &gt;&gt; So, what if that was a Nile Green hired me? &gt;&gt; No. No. So, what? Okay. My criticism of you. Okay. Are you ready for criticism? &gt;&gt; No. It hurts me deeply. And I &gt;&gt; give him the criticism. He needs to hear otherwise he won't grow. Um, &gt;&gt; I've never seen you make that face, bro. &gt;&gt; You look like a eater. So before I give my criticism, I'll just say the what Nile Green did well was that he matched the way I wrote, &gt;&gt; if that makes sense. &gt;&gt; It wasn't just like the AI made it sound like me. It was the way that he like built his sentences were very similar. So the moment I heard it, I'm like, "Oh, this guy's listened to a lot of videos." &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Well, or maybe he trained like an AI. &gt;&gt; Sentence structure sucked. &gt;&gt; I mean, I the first thing that stood out to me cuz you were asking me to analyze it was that it was just like a really long sentence. Wait, you talk a lot. &gt;&gt; No, no, but like &gt;&gt; he has punctuation. &gt;&gt; Yeah, like you just &gt;&gt; Oh, too many. &gt;&gt; It was just a complete &gt;&gt; too many moments for them to slot to scroll. &gt;&gt; They would they would have scrolled away in my version. &gt;&gt; I could I could It was hard for me to follow cuz there was just like your balls running away. &gt;&gt; Well, wait. Let's Let's do this. Do Do your best version of Nick's concept of the video. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great idea. &gt;&gt; Pass. That's fine. I this is he can work on this. This is this is his work anymore. &gt;&gt; This is his work. &gt;&gt; You know, I don't want to get in in the way of his creative uh career creative endeavor of Nile Orange. &gt;&gt; Is Nile Green still around? &gt;&gt; Do you take him out back? &gt;&gt; I I had to take him out back. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. So, what was what was kind of interesting with that whole scenario was that we first found his channel, people would share it, you know, with us and I think someone emailed it to me and I thought they were super funny because it's just they were just unhinged and they were pretty well made cuz he refilmed it wasn't like he took AI video which didn't exist at the time. He refilmed everything and tried to match my style &gt;&gt; like filmed it but used AI for the voice. &gt;&gt; Correct. So, it's like he wrote it and filmed it. He basically was like already he was creating it. So I'm just like oh this is like not even low effort. Um &gt;&gt; he did the hard part kind of though. &gt;&gt; Yeah he did he did like everything a lot of work. &gt;&gt; Maybe he's mute &gt;&gt; and now it's a tragedy. &gt;&gt; So when &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; I mean it had very low views and we thought it was so funny and even my dad saw it one day went over. He's like I saw this hilarious video. But then we woke up one day and it went from like a,000 views to like 600,000. &gt;&gt; Yes. And then now I'm getting emails saying like, "Hey, I saw you do this video." And I'm like, "Oh, no. This is a problem." People think this is me. &gt;&gt; One of your sponsors like, "Your balls are in the way. I don't understand." &gt;&gt; So, well, yeah. Some people I had someone come up to me and they're like, "Oh, I saw you do this crazy thing with caffeine." I'm like, "Oh my god, this person's actually, &gt;&gt; dude, that's crazy." But this is like the beginning of AI. &gt;&gt; And I was like, "How do I deal with this?" Cuz &gt;&gt; technically there was like not it wasn't really happening everyone else. &gt;&gt; So, you hunted him down. You took him out back. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You sent a team of assassins to his house &gt;&gt; just just by coincidence. I don't remember how it all happened. I don't know if you know uh Tom who runs the channel Explosions and Fire, &gt;&gt; another chemistry channel. He I don't know how he he knew the guy who ran the channel cuz they both just by Quizence were from they lived in the same place in Australia. &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. So, like a small town in &gt;&gt; I don't know how they knew each other. So, when I this was happening, I was like, can you get me in contact with him? But I talked to him and he was just a nice guy. &gt;&gt; Did he kind of sound like you? &gt;&gt; He's talking He's talking with the &gt;&gt; No, he's No, he doesn't sound like me. &gt;&gt; He's Australian. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. &gt;&gt; Did he sound like Nick's impression of you? &gt;&gt; You want me to take down the video, but I won't let you do it. &gt;&gt; You don't like looking in the mirror, do you? &gt;&gt; You don't like when the void gazes back. &gt;&gt; I wanted to turn styrofoam into marshmallows, &gt;&gt; but I needed more chemicals. &gt;&gt; So, wait. You call this guy up and he's like, "I sorry, mate." Exactly. &gt;&gt; Mike Russ doesn't have guns. Mine does. Okay. So, we're going to roll deep. &gt;&gt; He's Canadian. &gt;&gt; Uh, no. But Australia. &gt;&gt; Wait. So, yeah. What was he? &gt;&gt; What was that conversation like? &gt;&gt; So, I just kind of I don't remember exactly, but I reached out and kind of was like trying to understand like where he's coming from. And very quickly, he just was basically like, "Oh, I like all the content you guys do. I love the science stuff." And he was like, "Honestly, I didn't think anyone would see this." And I got the big sense that like he wasn't doing it to troll me or anything. He was doing it because he just thought it was funny. And he was like, "Oh," he actually told me later, he's like, "Maybe this was get their attention. That would be interesting." So he said he even started panicking when it started getting lots of views cuz he's like, "Oh no, they're going to hate me." &gt;&gt; Like Yeah. He's like, "The people who I want would want to like talk to and potentially hang out with would hate me. That's like not what I want." So he even said he's like, "I can just take down all the videos." And I was actually like, "No, they're kind of funny." And he was like, "Yeah." And he goes, "I had a couple more that I was making. I can just scrap them and not post them." And I actually said, I'm like, "No, just post what you have. Just don't make new videos." &gt;&gt; Okay. You let him finish out his career. &gt;&gt; Make him clean his desk right there. &gt;&gt; Well, I also told him like, you can see that this is going to be a problem. And I was like, I'm not like to be I'm not like threatening you with anything. I'm like, but there will be a point at which if enough people confuse me and like this whole AI thing, I'm like, YouTube could even have a problem back. I mean, this this is like a pervasive issue now. Like I mean, this is what two three years ago, I guess. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And when it happened, &gt;&gt; I I mean, I don't know if this I remember cuz I went to Educ and people at YouTube would come and ask me about it because it was like at the time they were telling me like they were having meetings on how to deal with it. Yeah, &gt;&gt; cuz they were like, this was like the first big faked YouTuber getting lots of views and they were like, how do we deal with this as a platform? &gt;&gt; I mean, they just made their first ruling YouTube. They uh &gt;&gt; I think last week decided to just not pay out channels whose content meets like a threshold of like too much AI content. &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; Yeah, dude. Cuz we did we were up we actually in Vancouver a couple months ago. We did the Northern Lineup. So, we were all hanging around on the television, which we never do anymore. You only do that in Airbnbs and hotel rooms to watch ridiculousness, but we turned on YouTube and it was just the default no account raw algorithm. &gt;&gt; That's always weird to say. &gt;&gt; Yes. And it just served and what it served us up, we we instantly look up awesome rap. And what it gave us was like AI Eminem versus AI Lil Wayne. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It was rap millions of views. 8 8 million 10 million views. &gt;&gt; A lot of them were just like Beyonce songs that didn't actually exist but were being pitched as new Beyonce songs. &gt;&gt; So it would be like Beyonce Love forever logo on the thumbnail. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I I I came to &gt;&gt; all the comments are like so beauty. &gt;&gt; This week I was in New York and I went on the subway while I was there and I saw this guy. He's he looks like he's in his 40s or 50s. He's on his phone and I'm standing next to him to his right so I can see what he's doing on his phone as uh we're we're on the ride and he, you know, he scrolls through Facebook and he's on a video of some edit of Obama giving a speech. Okay, &gt;&gt; I don't know what it's saying, but he leaves a comment and he's like, "That's my goat." And then all caps, "Obama, my president forever." And then &gt;&gt; the guy did this. &gt;&gt; The guy did this. And then I'm not kidding. scrolls down immediately to an AI video of what would the Flintstones and Jetsons look like in 2025 that has been AI generated and he's like watching it. It goes for a minute and a half and it showcases every character from these old cartoons in like that bizarre AI animal style and he hits like and he keeps scrolling and I was like, &gt;&gt; "Dude, you were on the subway with a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] clanker." &gt;&gt; I was I was like This is the guy. You met the guy. The guy. &gt;&gt; Wait, you don't know about clanker? &gt;&gt; It's the new slur for robots. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; Yeah, this is new. &gt;&gt; That is horrible. &gt;&gt; Cuz that guy is clearly a clanker. He's disguised as a human pretending to watch shorts. &gt;&gt; This is really awesome. Robots need entertainment. &gt;&gt; What I was thinking is they need to promote their own AI videos. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. When you scroll through this content, when you look at those like weird slop videos on Facebook, when you look at this AI content and you see the people that are engaging with it, you have this question of who is this? Who watches this and legitimately engages with this content? And I'm like, I'm meeting the guy. The guy's in front of &gt;&gt; you should have shook his goddamn metal cold hand. &gt;&gt; I wanted to interview him. I My instinct was like, if I can sit down for 45 minutes with this man, I'll understand something more about humanity. &gt;&gt; I love the Jetsons and Obama's my goat. What else do you want? I I think there's something just weird. I've talked about this before. Just I'm not saying everyone who comments on YouTube, but like the people who make certain comments like and the one that I don't know why it always stands out to me in your video you're scrolling. You know, of course there's some hate comments, there's some positive ones. Then there's just the comments like good. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Like &gt;&gt; and you're like, who wrote this? Like I I've never watched a video and was like I'm going to make a comment. Just write good good. So, at least if it's a hate or super positive, you're like, "Okay, I can see why they're motivated to share their opinion." But it's just like I think I always figured that those type of people were going to be people in their 40s and older. Like it it reminded me of like my dad texting me because he doesn't understand how syntax and typing translate into meaning in like a text conversation, right? Cuz he didn't grow up on the internet. So he doesn't understand that phrasing your or showcasing your words in text sort of communicate different feelings and things. &gt;&gt; So he comes across as kind of a psychopath over text. Like &gt;&gt; I mean my dad does the dot dot dot. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Where does that come from? Why do they all do that? &gt;&gt; You know what also old people do for they write they use &gt;&gt; say us. Oh how old are you by the way? &gt;&gt; Uh 34. &gt;&gt; 35 my man. &gt;&gt; Oh my. He wiped his hand before she kind of Oh my god. Are you nervous? &gt;&gt; Year of the &gt;&gt; Don't Don't know. I only know and 90. &gt;&gt; We're going to do like year of the pig like Chinese. &gt;&gt; I think I know mine. &gt;&gt; I I'm I'm a horse &gt;&gt; horse. &gt;&gt; Are you going to guess mine? &gt;&gt; I I thought I knew 91. &gt;&gt; You are year of ox strong bruncher. &gt;&gt; I think it's Wait, why do I think it's the goat? &gt;&gt; That's hard. &gt;&gt; I didn't think that talking about what's a bar. That's a bar. &gt;&gt; Someone make a Nile red edit. &gt;&gt; I could be completely wrong. I make a red people. old people love using quotation marks as emphasis. They think it means underlining something. So it to be like I'm really mad and it's like you're a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] idiot. I don't know what to tell you how how do you can't underline you can't underline and text. &gt;&gt; You can bold you can italic. I'm talking I guess emails. &gt;&gt; You can also double asterisk both sides. &gt;&gt; That's actually high level. I haven't figured out how to bold or under sorry. &gt;&gt; It's controlB. &gt;&gt; No, he's talking about on the phone. Oh on the on the table &gt;&gt; on the phone you use Apple and then you do the goes boing. if you hold a set. I'm like, &gt;&gt; by the way, on the subject of looking over people's shoulders invasively and watching what they do on their phone, &gt;&gt; uh, we were backstage waiting to set up and I I had to be 2 minutes before you got found us. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Does it make you feel big doing this? &gt;&gt; What happened? &gt;&gt; What do we I'm looking over at his phone, who I've known for years, and he just is googling, "What is Nyall Red's real name?" I didn't know if I was being served fake news. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And he's reading the AI [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] results and he's like Nigel &gt;&gt; Nigel Brown. &gt;&gt; Is that where the name kind of comes from? &gt;&gt; I basically um not really. &gt;&gt; No. No. So the I mean I started the channel in 2014 and of course I feel like most creators especially back then you have no idea where it's going to go. you like you weren't planning for anything. So, I had made I was working in a lab and I recorded what I was doing and I made some crappy video which I actually think is not even on the channel anymore. Um, &gt;&gt; your visiting the zoo video is gone. &gt;&gt; Yeah, actually YouTube kept striking it. So, &gt;&gt; I was making I was making flash paper. &gt;&gt; Oh, flash is cool. A very interesting first video. &gt;&gt; I I I don't know how I decided on it. I was just in in the lab and I was like, can I use these resources? Like, sure. So, I did it. So, I tried I had to upload it. I'm like, I need a channel name. And at the time, I'm like, I don't care. I just need a name to upload it. But everything I thought of just sounded lame. So then I was sitting there with actually a grad student and this is when like labs were going on cuz I was a lab tech. And we're like, what do we name it? And he's like, what's this? And behind us was like just a chemical book. So we opened it up and I was like, go to N cuz my name starts with N. And we just literally scrolled down and we just saw Nile red. I'm like I mean that sounds &gt;&gt; was it two words or one? &gt;&gt; It was two maybe. What is Nile red? &gt;&gt; Um, it's just a dye. It's like a to &gt;&gt; Oh, is it like red 40? &gt;&gt; It's a dye for use to like stain tissue to study it. I think &gt;&gt; there was a there's a cross word answer was Nile Green. So, it's like a It's a shade. It's a shade. It's a shade of red. &gt;&gt; Famous AI YouTuber or also, what's your Venmo? It's kind of the same story. &gt;&gt; Uh, yeah. I was competing to get a payment and I scrolled through a book and I ended up on [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Slayer 69. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's uh a little bit, you know. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then you made the little John Williams. A little Well, that's cuz I just like John Williams. &gt;&gt; You just like that name? &gt;&gt; No. Yeah. I just didn't want to use my real name and I just like John Williams, the or the orchestra, the composer. &gt;&gt; Okay. Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's all it came from. So, okay. You've been doing YouTube since 2014. Mhm. &gt;&gt; You were a lab tech before you. So, you have a degree &gt;&gt; uh in biochemistry. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Bachelor's though. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Sorry. I was &gt;&gt; What's your sign, by the way, real quick. &gt;&gt; I didn't mean to laugh. &gt;&gt; No. No. What's yours? What's your degree? &gt;&gt; No. What is it? &gt;&gt; I have a bachelor's degree in English. &gt;&gt; That's pretty good. &gt;&gt; We all speak it. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I mean, &gt;&gt; no. Isn't the meme though like you get a I guess it's biology. That's like the useless undergrad degree. I don't know how science works, but &gt;&gt; the meme is English. &gt;&gt; Even the meme is yours. &gt;&gt; It's not biology or biochemistry. &gt;&gt; No, I would argue an undergrad biology degree is equally as useless as an English degree. &gt;&gt; You're crazy. &gt;&gt; You can't say I'm got to be right in an argument. &gt;&gt; So, what what I'll say is like &gt;&gt; when you &gt;&gt; I think that biology because I actually started as an undergrad in bio in biology. Larry, but I switched to biochem. I would say that &gt;&gt; any I mean just across the board any degree that doesn't have like a designated application is going to be obviously more difficult to use. &gt;&gt; So in the sciences I do think that biology kind of falls under that. And also there at at least in my school there's cell biology and anatomy that was kind of like there's not really an application but people would take those degrees because they were kind of like easier than the other ones and then they would use that to get high grades to then apply to med school. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; but if you didn't get into med school &gt;&gt; then &gt;&gt; then you better start English. I don't know what to do with that. &gt;&gt; Get ready to learn English, buddy. &gt;&gt; So what were you what were you hoping to do? I guess what were you doing? Like what what does a lab tech mean? &gt;&gt; Okay, so I mean the lab tech I was a lab tech in a chemistry lab too. Like so I did biochem cuz I my goal was to become I wanted to go into med school but then once I graduated I'm like I don't really want to do that. So then I was like I don't know what to do. And I had a friend who was working as a lab tech and he's like I'm leaving but if you want my job you can basically have it. &gt;&gt; And I'm like I'm not I don't really have anything else to do right now. STEM students everywhere are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fuming. They're like, "Yeah, if you want my awesome job, I'll give it to you." And I don't even know if I want it. &gt;&gt; I mean, it was a good job, honestly. But a lot of it was like there's students who have labs and you just have to make sure that, you know, the chemicals are there, the equipment's out, but there's kind of like instructions that you follow and put out the chemicals. Like the most you do is they'll say, "Oh, this chemical needs to be prepared." But a lot of it's just mixing it with water. &gt;&gt; It's like not really that. Yeah. Exactly. Oh, you can use the big words around us. &gt;&gt; I don't know if I asked you a question, but that was like that was what I did. &gt;&gt; I got you. I got you. &gt;&gt; Dilute it. &gt;&gt; When is it diluting and when is it dissolving? &gt;&gt; Dissol dissol. I forgot. &gt;&gt; Diluting is when you take something, make it less potent by adding water. And dissolving is when it mixes inside of it &gt;&gt; and then it chemically chemically bonds to the water. When you dilute, you are dissolving. &gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Can you make mustard gas? &gt;&gt; Whoa. &gt;&gt; Um, sure. You need some? Yeah. How hard is it? &gt;&gt; So, I think it's really easy. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's awesome. &gt;&gt; So, I think it's exceptionally easy, which is actually the hard Well, the harder part is getting the chemicals to make it &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Well, I always see videos on YouTube shorts of people mixing cleaners in a toilet. &gt;&gt; That's not mustard gas. &gt;&gt; And it looks beautiful, but then the comments say, "Congrats, you've made mustard gas, idiot." &gt;&gt; No, that's just like &gt;&gt; the commenters are dumb. &gt;&gt; Household toxic gas. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So I think when you mix bleach and &gt;&gt; ammonia, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Ammonia, you make chloromine, which is like kind of chlorine. Like, &gt;&gt; is it bad for you? &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, like if you fill a room with it and you have to breathe it, you'll have either bad problem. I mean, depending on how much it is, but it could kill you potentially. Like people have died from it. &gt;&gt; What's like the biggest mistake you've made in your video? Like where you were like, "Oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that was this is bad." &gt;&gt; Um, you know, part of me is like, "Don't say it." Because then, you know, the viewers are like, you know, I'm I'm It's self-inccriminating, right? &gt;&gt; Oh, sure. &gt;&gt; No, no. So, the one that I would say is &gt;&gt; the biggest mistake um &gt;&gt; allegedly &gt;&gt; allegedly allegedly mistake. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to think cuz like the ones that led to injuries are probably the ones that are the biggest mistakes. But one of them was back when I was working in my parents' garage. I had a um I was doing a video where it was called I was making a bipolar medication. &gt;&gt; Lithium. Yeah, lithium. So, you like take apart a battery and you &gt;&gt; My mom was bipolar &gt;&gt; and you reacted with water, but I had to refilm some I I I lost all the footage, so I had to refilm it and I was kind of like annoyed about that. So, once I got the whole thing set up again, I realized I had a bit of extra lithium and I was just like, I don't need this. I'll just throw it in this cup of water and it just exploded. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what happened. I knew that. &gt;&gt; So, it's lithium is not really supposed It's not normal that it explodes. M. So, I actually made a short on it because I wanted to like go over that again. And what's crazy is when I did it, it like detonated and it blew the glass up, but the original one didn't do it. It just threw molten lithium all over my garage. And like if it lands on you, it's just going to like it could theoretically there's a lot. It could like send you to the bone. And like pouring pouring water on it's not really going to help &gt;&gt; cuz that's what made it react with water. So it's like you So I just kind of need to tough it out. &gt;&gt; So it just blows up and I'm just like standing there. I'm like &gt;&gt; you need a fire blanket. &gt;&gt; Well, you have you need to actually you can't even put it out with like um I think CO2 won't do it. You can't use water. Like they use specifically for lithium. You need like sodium. You have to have like a salt um &gt;&gt; you have to you have to smother it with salt. &gt;&gt; Dude, imagine having a a flesh wound of magma and having to pour salt all over it. What if you got a flesh wound and then you looked at it and it was all like bionic like like it was all wires and you learned you were an AI. &gt;&gt; And then you could in the subway and you look up and there's a tall guy just staring at you. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; No, this is just called you a clanker. &gt;&gt; This is like in Fight Club. It's like in Fight Club when he's burning and he's like you can pour water on it to make it worse or you can pour vinegar on it to neutralize the burn. &gt;&gt; So all I know about water on it would be better. &gt;&gt; Okay. So So Chuck Pollenic lied. Well, I mean generally just water is great when you have something on you. &gt;&gt; Do you know I failed chemistry twice? Vinegar wouldn't really do anything either. &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. Failed chemistry twice. &gt;&gt; I failed it twice. I failed. That's impressive. &gt;&gt; It's hard. It's so Well, I can't &gt;&gt; I didn't do great in chemistry either. &gt;&gt; What's so hard? &gt;&gt; Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Great. &gt;&gt; You were in high school. I got like I remember the first half of the year I had like 60%. I was like I was afraid of not even passing. &gt;&gt; Rocks cuz you were there in high school. Same as me being like, "What is a mole? Why what is this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] It doesn't make sense. You guys don't even know what &gt;&gt; were you like a lowkey chiller." &gt;&gt; Like, were you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] off or were you You just didn't get it. &gt;&gt; I I I mean, I think the answer is I I cannot pay attention in class. &gt;&gt; It's like impossible. &gt;&gt; You're bound to be a YouTuber. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I don't I I've don't think I've ever paid attention to a class ever. What's crazy is you have a biochemistry degree. Did you Did you ever cheat &gt;&gt; uh in high school? &gt;&gt; Yeah, me too. &gt;&gt; I actually I have a story about that. I cheated off my friend. &gt;&gt; I had I had my answers and I went I was like, "Okay, I don't know what I'm doing." And my friend I looked at him like, "You know what you're doing?" He's like, "Yeah." So I cheated off of him. I changed my right answers for his wrong answers and I did badly in and that day taught me like, &gt;&gt; you know, your friends are stupid. &gt;&gt; I was in house. It was smarter friends. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But they taught me that like cheating isn't necessarily better. &gt;&gt; Your friends might be the guy you're cheating off might be dumber than you are. &gt;&gt; I actually on a chemistry test. I failed the class, but I cheated on a chemistry test. I sat like this in class and I shaved a square out of my leg and I wrote all the answers right here and then I just, you know, just I I flying colors. &gt;&gt; Hell yeah. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I still failed the class. It was &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh yeah, science has always just been so mysterious. So everything I ever learned through it was just movies &gt;&gt; and shows. &gt;&gt; I'm not sure how great of an education you got then. &gt;&gt; Well, I know how to make blue method who is &gt;&gt; What if I told you that the blue color means it's less pure? &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Well, then I'm not smoking it, brother. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; I don't like smoking it cuz the color. &gt;&gt; Explain that. Cuz Walter White knew what he was doing. &gt;&gt; No, no, I don't know. I don't know. &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't remember the show. I watched it so many years ago. But basically like generally most I would say like most organic compounds are white or colorless. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Obviously the dyes and other stuff have color but like you can expect if you make most organic compounds most drugs it's like they're just white powders and then if you crystallize it they're just clear colorless things. And if they're tinted usually you get like brown &gt;&gt; crack is brown a lot. &gt;&gt; You get like different colors. It just means that there's crap in it. If I was going to make it step by step, where would I start? Okay, so you know &gt;&gt; what you need to do. &gt;&gt; So you're saying that's cap. You're saying the blue meth was a device in Breaking Bad. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'm so &gt;&gt; Vince Gilligan lied to you. &gt;&gt; I can't trust anything. &gt;&gt; Can I run a game with you is called can you make it? And you just tell me yes or no. &gt;&gt; Yes or no? Well, wait, wait, wait. One question beforehand. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Can I physically make it? Because there's sometimes like I could make it if I could get the chemical, but I'll never be able to get the chemical &gt;&gt; because it's illegal. &gt;&gt; So, yeah. Or whatever. Ether's under. &gt;&gt; So, it's like &gt;&gt; I think that's encompassed. And can you make it is like if I decided I wanted to, could it happen? &gt;&gt; Yes. Okay. Yes. &gt;&gt; I think it's just yes for everything. &gt;&gt; What? Okay. Okay. Then &gt;&gt; you're the goat. Then let's play yes. Yes. No. &gt;&gt; Anything you'll say is probably a yes. &gt;&gt; Um the second son. Oh, okay. I thought you meant like &gt;&gt; No, I meant cocaine. &gt;&gt; CO4. &gt;&gt; Okay. That's actually really complicated to make. &gt;&gt; Cocaine. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's much you're much better off just extracting it naturally. &gt;&gt; Meth. &gt;&gt; Meth is I think probably one of the easiest ones to make. &gt;&gt; Can I make it? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; That's so cool. &gt;&gt; What's kind of funny is like meth is for whatever reason be viewed as hard to make. But there is a it's it's funny like people who know it know it. So when I I've often said like, oh, it's called the classic shake and bake method. And then some people like immediately know what I'm talking about and everyone else just looks at me with like a blank stare. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But it's basically it was invented by people who do drugs and have no scientific background and they want to be able to just load everything into a water bottle and shake it &gt;&gt; and then have meth and it's from household items. Like they literally use the lithium battery. Uh they get drain cleaner. Uh brake fluid. &gt;&gt; Dude, all this sounds so gross by the way. Like if I'm going to consume it, it's you're you're like getting together an old battery drain cleaner and you're like, "This is going to be so yummy." &gt;&gt; So yeah, they get they get lithium uh drain cleaner. It's like brake fluid. It's not brake fluid. It's like uh cleaner. So it's like it's supposed to be ether &gt;&gt; engine degreaser. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then you get uh pseudafed or something. &gt;&gt; Uh and I think the last ingredient is usually like some ammonia thing, like a cleaner. And then you put it in the bottle and you just shake it. &gt;&gt; Why does everybody make this? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, &gt;&gt; I think a lot of them are making it. &gt;&gt; They Why aren't we? &gt;&gt; There are uh laws, you say. Okay. &gt;&gt; And also, &gt;&gt; do you need meth? &gt;&gt; No, but like &gt;&gt; we could sell it. &gt;&gt; We could sell it. &gt;&gt; A lot of money probably, right? &gt;&gt; It worked in World War II. It energized. &gt;&gt; That all is meth, right? People say &gt;&gt; I will say I can't help you with that project. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's fair. &gt;&gt; I believe in you, &gt;&gt; but I'll send you the results when it's done. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and like send it like across the border. Wait, so no, no, no. Don't. Sorry. We said send the results. For some reason, I thought you meant like a photo. &gt;&gt; I'm going to ship it to you. &gt;&gt; Even don't involve me with any of that. &gt;&gt; We can ship stuff to Canada. &gt;&gt; Nigel is the one who taught me everything I know. &gt;&gt; The thing the thing that's like bad, I mean, because I do all the chemistry stuff and I'm not like a I'm not like uh I say a proper company or a I'm not like affiliated with the government. I'm not academia. It's like I actively will like not do anything even remotely affiliated with drugs like that. They just want to give like an excuse so for the government to like look into it. So even for like you if you sent me like a photo or anything I'd be like &gt;&gt; I got I got to report you the package. &gt;&gt; It's you with your a picture with your garage meth your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] teeth is out &gt;&gt; and I have a cutout of Nigel next to me. &gt;&gt; I'd be like uh uh &gt;&gt; didn't really know him. Canadian government. &gt;&gt; I wish you didn't send that. I don't know. I was like I actively tried to like not be involved talking about it's fine. &gt;&gt; So well I guess &gt;&gt; not that I actually think you would do any of that. &gt;&gt; Wait, we're going to shut up later. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. I think I believe you could. &gt;&gt; to try to get me to not do it. &gt;&gt; You could do it if you could. You could. I believe in you. &gt;&gt; So there's certain like chemicals you don't have access to as a layman. Like we don't have access to. Do you get special access? So, the thing that shocked me honestly was I remember this conversation pretty vividly because I felt stupid for asking it. There's a guy I met who sells chemicals. That's his I mean that's his company. &gt;&gt; He's just one of those guys. &gt;&gt; There's a guy sell officer. It was a guy I met he runs a small chemical company &gt;&gt; and I remember asking him something about like oh I couldn't work with the bigger one cuz it's like I don't have a chemical license and he was just like that what are you talking about? And when he said that I'm like oh I feel dumb. But he was basically like that doesn't exist. There's no such thing as like a chemical license. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; So, well, to a certain degree, like if you're importing, exporting, and other stuff, there's things, but as like an individual, the only thing stopping you from buying from like a major chemical company &gt;&gt; is just &gt;&gt; it's up to them to deter they're liable if they sell someone something that's bad. So, it's entirely up to them to determine who's a good customer. And usually that's just you need to have a registered business and they'll sell you anything that isn't like on, you know, some DEA listed down, brother, if you got the bread for it. &gt;&gt; Even they'll sell you anything that's not explicitly listed as like a controlled substance. And even in Canada, you can like write a purpose and reason and they'll still sell it to you, but they're like logging that you bought The last the last 15 minutes are going to have that most replayed bit of a YouTube video. &gt;&gt; No, but it's just crazy. Like it shocked me that there's just if you have a business, you can pretty much from a lot of the major chemical companies. Oh, and you need a business address. That's actually harder. &gt;&gt; Are you in good sanding? Are you buying that good [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] now? &gt;&gt; I have, you know, I have some connections. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, what if I started a Tik Tok account and I just kind of like went like this and just like picked any two chemicals and I just would just combine them. It was a Tik Tok where I just combine two random chemicals. &gt;&gt; Combining chemicals until I see an awesome reaction. I go I just keep going until like my either my house burns down or my skin melts off. &gt;&gt; So what I would say is like it's kind of sad but you probably have pretty bad videos. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Cuz most reactions will be just won't do anything. &gt;&gt; I would or anyone doing this &gt;&gt; anyone doing that. Sorry. No offense. &gt;&gt; I thought really it was a me left and right. &gt;&gt; The the big thing with chemicals is like there's just many different groups of chemicals. So you get like oxidizers, reducers, bases, acids. So it's like if you took a base and mix it with a base, probably literally nothing happens. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's just like Coca-Cola and milk, &gt;&gt; the same thing. &gt;&gt; But then when I finally hit, &gt;&gt; the crowd goes wild. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you like you might just be like you happen to some you don't even know what you're doing. You add like a bit of an acid and a bit of a base and it just gets like warm. &gt;&gt; Surely surely this is like the guy who made elephant toothpaste. He probably was doing something like this. He was just like like I'm going to I'm going to mix this. Whoops. How is &gt;&gt; my house is like &gt;&gt; the first guy to make elephant toothpaste before every YouTuber bastardized it and did it bigger and bigger until like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are we even &gt;&gt; probably happened on this scale now that I think about it and someone was like what if we did a lot &gt;&gt; I don't even know how where elephant toothpaste came from but it is a big thing like hydrogen peroxide which is what it's based around breaks down super easily so it's in a lot of chemistry when you use it in a reaction you quench it by throwing in something to break down the peroxide and then it just fizzes like So, I bet you somebody just &gt;&gt; was doing a reaction that had like a soap like thing in it, like a surfactant, and it just foamed. There's probably a problem in &gt;&gt; like he was he's like, "Oh, it's so annoying. I'm done my reaction. It takes forever to neutralize it cuz it just foams like crazy." And then some guy was just like, "Oh, that's cool. I'm going to add some dye to it." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's probably not really It's They don't think anyone tried to design it. They They just like it was just a thing. It &gt;&gt; was a real chem head. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Top five. What are your top five chemicals? &gt;&gt; I'm a chem head. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Real chemical. &gt;&gt; Give me your top five chemicals. &gt;&gt; What are your top five chemicals? &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; And do you know five? &gt;&gt; All right. Is weed a chemical? &gt;&gt; What about money? &gt;&gt; Is money a chemical? &gt;&gt; Is rap music a chemical? Is love a chemical? &gt;&gt; Love can be five. &gt;&gt; Um, and then yeah, rap music is number two. And then is chlorine is number three? &gt;&gt; That's that's a good chemical. &gt;&gt; Uh, dopamine. &gt;&gt; Solid pick. &gt;&gt; That's this guy's good. Isn't that a compound? &gt;&gt; He's two for four. He's named Love in rap. &gt;&gt; Wait, that's two and I got two more. &gt;&gt; Yeah, your final one. &gt;&gt; You don't think that's a real chlorine? Cuz we put in pools. &gt;&gt; Keep going. What else? &gt;&gt; That's five. &gt;&gt; Oh, he's good. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he's good. &gt;&gt; Could you do better? &gt;&gt; Yeah, easily. &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; I would go uh &gt;&gt; just broine. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you're going to list the periodic table. &gt;&gt; Ununium. I like that one. I always like the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up ones with three letters. That's an element, not a chemical. &gt;&gt; I have a vulnerable question. I have a vulnerable question. Is is is just an element on its own a chemical? &gt;&gt; So, you know what? I actually fear a lot of these simple questions because I often don't know the answer. I remember one of my worst experiences was trying to tutor somebody in like high school chemistry and I didn't know anything. &gt;&gt; And you had 60%. What are you doing out there? &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Acron scientist was the same, bro. We asked him questions about electricity. &gt;&gt; He said, "What's a vault?" He goes, "I actually don't know." And he and he's about to electrocute me. And then was that Kevin? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; A bold. It's hard to define. &gt;&gt; Then he said a unit of power and everyone. Oh, okay. And I'm like that's not really the explanation. &gt;&gt; I &gt;&gt; We took the answer from the crowd. Let's be clear. &gt;&gt; Someone said they said it's a unit of potential energy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then Kevin said Kevin basically said, "Oh, that sounds good." And I was looking at him. You're about to electrocute me. You just took an answer from chat. the I mean I think there's a lot of these vague terms like I think I I don't know what &gt;&gt; what the hell is Kelvin &gt;&gt; okay &gt;&gt; or Scoville what's going &gt;&gt; this started with what's a chemical to what's a volt to now what's Kelvin &gt;&gt; okay so I'll say what's a chemical I think I've looked up the definition I think it's like a chemical is literally &gt;&gt; guy who taught us to make me math earlier &gt;&gt; yeah I looked up what's a chemical &gt;&gt; I looked up the definition &gt;&gt; I think it was like I I don't know the actual definition something a pure substance &gt;&gt; like a substance that can be purified like it was something like very vague. So that's why an element can be a chemical because you can have a pure version of it. &gt;&gt; Interesting. &gt;&gt; Whereas like you can't have &gt;&gt; peanut butter. &gt;&gt; No, see that can't be a chemical because a part of it could be a chemical cuz you can like isolate it like sugar. &gt;&gt; You make the most pure cookie. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a little bit of that's a that's a controversial movie magic if you will. controversial controversial video. &gt;&gt; So you couldn't synthesize an element though, right? Like that wouldn't be possible. &gt;&gt; You can theoretically like they you can just smash. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Don't you need like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Isn't there one machine in the world that like smashes the proton and then we like create a new element that exists for like 03 seconds and then we add it to the table? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Or even if it exists longer. It's the classic thing where like they run the experiment. As far as I know, they run the experiment. And it's like they have things collecting data and then it's like from the data they they do calculations go, "Oh yeah, a new element was made." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Whereas they're not like bombarding something and then going, "Oh my god, we have like seven pounds of this new element. Let's look at it." &gt;&gt; It's kind of like you can't I think it's atoms. You can't &gt;&gt; I think they named I I think most of them are named now, but I remember growing up and looking at the table in science class and looking at the last like 15. They all start with They all start with two u but they a lot of them got named in the recent years. &gt;&gt; I have a question. And does it freak you out? I asked Hank Green this when he was on and he didn't really give me a satisfactory answer. Maybe I don't remember what he told me, but the idea that like &gt;&gt; different things &gt;&gt; everything is just reduced down to this concept that nothing's touching. I I I can't sleep sometimes. That's that's what keeps you up. &gt;&gt; That's that's the thing. &gt;&gt; He doesn't like being filled with holes. &gt;&gt; Has a pretty awesome life. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I just think that it freaks me out to think that everything is these little tiny balls that aren't touching. Does that freak you out? &gt;&gt; Why not? &gt;&gt; You never thought about it. No, I have. Like, you know. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; He's a man of science. &gt;&gt; I don't know. It just I just go, "Okay." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Me, too. Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's the way it is. &gt;&gt; Cuz like I don't know. In a macro sense, you don't know that. Like, you just know that cuz you're told that. But like when you do this, it's like that's touchy. That's touchy to me. &gt;&gt; I I have I have a I have a a another question. Does it freak you out that you're you have holes in you? [Music] &gt;&gt; Some of my holes I enjoy very much. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; I'm fine with them. I like eating tacos. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Right. But doesn't it like freak you out that there's like an there's an entry point into your body. &gt;&gt; No, that makes sense to me. Okay. &gt;&gt; There's got to be a way in. &gt;&gt; Why would you Yeah. &gt;&gt; Freak me out if there was no way out. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; if there was just a way in. Then I'd be scared cuz then I'd be like, "Where is it all going?" &gt;&gt; I guess that's fair. Who are they stuck? &gt;&gt; On the note of tacos, I I have I heard a rumor that you ordered like 50 to your hotel last night. &gt;&gt; I think we ordered 72. Yeah. &gt;&gt; What is up with that? What were you doing? You &gt;&gt; every open sauce, we just order a lot of tacos. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's like a tradition. &gt;&gt; This is the second one. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, there's there's actually the Okay, the reasoning is dumber. Basically, where I'm from is Montreal, which is in the province of Quebec in Canada. &gt;&gt; You speak French. I'll say I understand French. &gt;&gt; You know what I just said? &gt;&gt; You can repeat it. &gt;&gt; I know the last one. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. You know, I know the first. I didn't understand the first. Yeah. Yeah. I get it now. Thank you. Thank you for that. Thank you. &gt;&gt; The last sad I'm I didn't know. I didn't know what you said for the first part. I get it. Yeah, I get it. Um &gt;&gt; I'm not going to repeat it. &gt;&gt; Please don't. I've done enough. &gt;&gt; Uh what was I saying? Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; In I love Taco Bell. &gt;&gt; Okay. there all the time. &gt;&gt; Fourth meal. &gt;&gt; But then one day I go to Taco Bell. And by go to Taco Bell, I mean I go to where Taco Bell once was &gt;&gt; a crater. &gt;&gt; It was a smoking crater &gt;&gt; gone. It was just &gt;&gt; hit by an asteroid. &gt;&gt; Yeah. No, it was it was taken away from me. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; Because that's actually a good qu like you asking about the French. I actually don't know why left, but I think it's probably because they just didn't want to like make their signs in French or something. I don't know. &gt;&gt; So they just left the entire province. &gt;&gt; Wow. That's actually crazy. for years. Every time I leave and go somewhere that has Taco Bell, that's like I have to have my my like my fix. &gt;&gt; So, what's your order? &gt;&gt; Um, I mean, it depends. I often just it it depends on how many times I order it, but usually the first order is just a lot of hard shell tacos. &gt;&gt; Hard shell tacos. Classes. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you're just chuging through 12 hard shell tacos. I want to talk about what you put in your body because I was going to ask that. We had a conversation last night. &gt;&gt; Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. put you on blast here. &gt;&gt; No, no. &gt;&gt; I'm going to put you on a small blast here. You're a 34 year old man. I I just hit 30. &gt;&gt; I've been told that. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And uh and you said you had a almost month-long diet of eating chicken nuggets, specifically the animal shaped one every single day for a month. &gt;&gt; Was this for a video? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's so so kind of kind of kind of. &gt;&gt; Wait, it was kind of for a video. &gt;&gt; This is kind of for a video. &gt;&gt; This is a lie that you tell yourself. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. I can't I can't explain to you. Basically, &gt;&gt; so this did happen. &gt;&gt; It did happen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He wanted to see the chemical his body would make of animal nuggies. &gt;&gt; I probably here or there had like, you know, a burger. &gt;&gt; That's your meal. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; You're having a burger in your down time. You got to break down your nugies with little burgers. &gt;&gt; Oh, no. No. But I started I don't even want to I don't even want to continue. You got to continue. &gt;&gt; I would have a chicken air girl sometimes, too. &gt;&gt; Okay. I kept on the chicken. No. So over co I gained a bunch of weight that I was not like super happy about. And um honestly when I went and did I filmed this the scale of the coyote thing with Will Osman, &gt;&gt; there was particularly like one photo that was taken of me that I looked at and I'm like I I don't like the extra the extra weight. &gt;&gt; I've been there. &gt;&gt; Can someone Can someone help me with my diet? So, &gt;&gt; so what I decided to do &gt;&gt; like you eat a pallet of chicken nuggets is so I've been wanting to lose, you know, some extra weight for a long time. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; I mean, since probably a year into co. So then I was like I came back and I was like, "Okay, I'm going to I'm going to do it." I did I did not like that photo. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You hate this photo. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I don't hate it. I just was like, "Whoa." Like &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It was a wakeup call, you know? Um, but at the same time, there is a video that I want to film. And the thing that I've been slacking on is that I actually need to like be fit for it. &gt;&gt; Any leaks? &gt;&gt; Um, you can cut it. &gt;&gt; I mean, I can just tell you. I don't I don't know if it needs to be. Yeah, I think I can just tell you, but cuz the idea is kind of stupid. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Basically, I'm trying to see how heavy I can get, but by like packing tungsten on myself. &gt;&gt; Oh, you called the right guy on this podcast. You're trying to like max out the scale. &gt;&gt; So I want to weigh 500 lb. &gt;&gt; So you want to hold like an extra &gt;&gt; I need like 350 lb of tungsten on me, but I was like to max but I want to look normal. So we bought a bunch of tungsten shot and we're going to like strap it all over my body. So I'm like I need my legs to be strong. &gt;&gt; You're going to be like Goku. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; How can you hold that much weight? &gt;&gt; That's where the training comes. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. I mean, you can farmers carry that much, especially if it's dispersed in a way that you don't have to carry it cuz that's usually the biggest thing that goes like your grip. &gt;&gt; A lot the tension of just standing. &gt;&gt; Oh, I guess kind of like when you're standing at the top of the squat, like you're resting it on your shoulders even if it's a lot. &gt;&gt; The big thing though is that to hide it cuz I want to look normal. I need to be as thin as possible. &gt;&gt; Oh, to lose the weight. Not not so that you're carrying less, but so that when you have the tungsten on, you don't look &gt;&gt; I need to be thin so the fat that was there could be tungsten. &gt;&gt; M he's not here to defend himself, but I think I could sleep Nile red in one punch. I could kill you. &gt;&gt; Oh, you could put him to bed. &gt;&gt; I could put you to bed, boy. &gt;&gt; Well, if you want to put him into a bed, he I don't think he even has a bed. Do you realize that? &gt;&gt; No, he does not. He sleeps on a series of chemicals. &gt;&gt; He sleeps on a series of chemical bottles. &gt;&gt; Chemical bed. &gt;&gt; Typical bed of mercury. He sleeps on mercury. Mercury's not bad for you. But if if you were going to get him a bed, what you know you could do is you could reach out to Helix sleep &gt;&gt; and you could get him a mattress from there and I could sleep with him on that bed &gt;&gt; and you could sleep way with him. I thought you &gt;&gt; said you wanted to sleep him. You knock him out. &gt;&gt; What's the difference? &gt;&gt; A huge difference. &gt;&gt; Big difference. &gt;&gt; Like you don't Well, there's also a big difference if you take the Helix sleep quiz to find your perfect mattress. Big difference of what mattress might fit you. &gt;&gt; I feel like he might get it. He might come back to you and he'd be like, "These chemicals keep me cool and comfortable at night." It's like how could how could anything ever sleep together? I'd be like, "Let's stay cool." &gt;&gt; Look, are you a midnight lux guy like me or are you something else? It depends on if you're a side sleeper, stomach sleeper, back sleeper. &gt;&gt; Maybe you're a head sleeper upside down like Aiden. Aiden sleeps on top of his head. &gt;&gt; I'm going to sleep you now. &gt;&gt; So, you can go take the sleep quiz and find out which one works for you. You can go to helixleep.com/theard for 27% off sitewide during this seasonal sale only for yard listeners. No one else gets it. &gt;&gt; No one else threat to his life to sleep with them. We're going to threaten you with a link that you can click. That's helixleep.com/theyard for 20% off sitewide. helixleep.com/theyard and let them know the yard sent you. Let them know Lewig sent you and they'll be like, "Oh my god, the guy from Deco. &gt;&gt; Oh my god, the guy that slept with Nyall Red." Well, anyway, thanks to Helix Fleet for sponsoring this week's episode &gt;&gt; and stick around to find out if he's cut or uncut. &gt;&gt; The reason I was I was eating all the chicken was because I had this goal now of like, you know, both the video and I was like, "Okay, cool. It's good to lose the weight." It just was like the easiest and laziest thing where you just look on Yeah. You look on the thing and you're like I've seen people eat only chicken. Like I've seen videos &gt;&gt; chicken nuggets are different. &gt;&gt; It's usually a guy and he's like making grilled chicken with some broccoli. &gt;&gt; Okay. Sorry. I back this up. It was chicken fingers is how it started. &gt;&gt; Okay. Right. Right. Okay. &gt;&gt; Cinema here. Here. &gt;&gt; Wait. It started as fingers and then you were like I wish these were shaped like animals. &gt;&gt; No. But like it is objectively not a good diet. But for some reason I woke up. I'm like I'm okay just not enjoying food for the next like month. &gt;&gt; So you got frozen chicken nuggets? &gt;&gt; Fingers then nuggets. &gt;&gt; You didn't even Wait, you didn't even enjoy it? &gt;&gt; I actually Well, so what? &gt;&gt; So you don't like them? &gt;&gt; No, they're fine. I started buying some I actually started buying like cool sauces. &gt;&gt; So that's what like that was like the thing that kept me going. That's what keeps you waking up. &gt;&gt; Give me your sauce to your list. Boy, you need to close. &gt;&gt; Honestly, I didn't get that far. All right. Actually, Chick-fil-A sauce to your list. Can you make each one? &gt;&gt; Uh, but no, like I it's not objectively it's it's a bad diet. &gt;&gt; I mean, the thing is &gt;&gt; it was just super easy to track your calories. &gt;&gt; All that matters is calories in versus calories out. And like obviously it's not good long term if you're overindexing on salt or something &gt;&gt; is maple syrup. Yeah. It's calories in, calories, calories out. &gt;&gt; I took jaundice, but calories in. So I also I was like, "Yeah, you got to be able to survive at least a few weeks on that cuz people people survive not eating for a few weeks." Like you make it. &gt;&gt; So I also had I made sure to have a I had a multivitamin to make sure you know I wasn't getting like a senu bean &gt;&gt; but I was never planning to go for very long and it was like after I think like three it was probably after a month. I was like &gt;&gt; I was only also aiming to lose like a pound or two a week like which is like as far as I understand the healthy reason. &gt;&gt; Hold on. Let me just Why don't we just let's wrap this all up. You needed to prepare for a new video that you needed to lose weight for. Yes. And &gt;&gt; the diet that you chose was to eat at first. &gt;&gt; Chicken fingers and then chicken nuggets for the month. Seeing that as the most optimized diet. &gt;&gt; Well, no, no. Optimized. &gt;&gt; Optimized for his laziness. Optimized for laziness. Also to lose weight. &gt;&gt; Let me ask. &gt;&gt; I could just throw it in a in an air fryer and just leave and come back and it was ready. What was eating before? &gt;&gt; So that's my other defense. My diet's generally horrible in general. &gt;&gt; Okay. Taco Bell. &gt;&gt; Exactly. So I was even before this diet, I was questioning my own health. So once I started this diet, I actually ate breakfast, lunch, and dinner. &gt;&gt; Whereas before I was &gt;&gt; Was it chicken all three meals? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That is psychotic. &gt;&gt; Hold on. Hold on. &gt;&gt; I'm on your side here now. On your side. &gt;&gt; And here the month has passed. So did it work? Yeah. Boom. I mean, you look good. Woke results. Yeah. What? Well, what's the what's the diet now? Are you normal? &gt;&gt; I just Yeah, &gt;&gt; because it's hard. What's funny is once I was like, "Okay, I don't need to diet anymore." I stopped eating breakfast and I'm like, "That's actually bad." &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; So, I actually have to fix that, but that's like a whole other problem. &gt;&gt; So, but for the most part, you eat like like normal food and you &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You made it out the other side. &gt;&gt; Isn't good? &gt;&gt; No, it depends. It's just fasting. If we call it fasting, it's good. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I I I think it's the most important meal of the day. And I don't know if that's cuz youard. &gt;&gt; I'm also I'm also anti breakfast &gt;&gt; food. The idea of breakfast food &gt;&gt; being eaten at breakfast time. I've talked to this before. I'm just kind of against it. &gt;&gt; Why? I shouldn't have brought this up. &gt;&gt; Are we talking about cereal or we bacon? &gt;&gt; I should have brought the whole cereal side or the eggs and bacon side. &gt;&gt; I like the food, &gt;&gt; but like Okay. This is a whole This is a whole t No, no, no, no, no. I get this. We can dig into this. &gt;&gt; You want to talk about I think I'm with you. Are you talking about like the freak [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] where you're like French toast and waffles and I'm not I'm not explaining this. I It bo like I don't believe in food being appropriate at certain times of the day. Like if you want to wake up and just eat steak dinner. &gt;&gt; No, if you want a steak for breakfast, that's fine. &gt;&gt; Well, steak and eggs is a thing. But &gt;&gt; he's basically I just wake up and you just have a you can have pizza. It doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; You're imagining you can have pancakes for dinner. just it's like &gt;&gt; no I think that I think that there are certain foods especially like super high carb foods that make you tired. &gt;&gt; It doesn't I guess that never happens to me. &gt;&gt; It's just not shackled by the constrictions of of society time locked. &gt;&gt; No, it's all societal. None of it is science-based. &gt;&gt; He is imagining a world without borders much like Solid Snake. Just this idea of a one one army. &gt;&gt; It's military. It's just like there'd be times where I I'd be eating something and people like, "Why are you eating that? That's not breakfast." And I'd be like, "It's &gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you, cop." &gt;&gt; Well, I don't have it like in I don't have an example on my head, but I'll be like, "It's like the breakfast food they like is literally the same thing just like chopped up and rearranged in a different form." And they're like, "What you're eating is not breakfast cuz the shape and form of it is like I would prefer to be in different farm animals but still be chicken." &gt;&gt; Not a red is cereal soup. &gt;&gt; Um, no. A definitive definitive second answer. &gt;&gt; I have a follow. Is a hot dog a sandwich? Yes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, and you can This is an infinite loop, too. &gt;&gt; No, it is a sandwich. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; No, it's binary. No. Uh, that's crazy. &gt;&gt; The chicken nugget thing is still on it. &gt;&gt; I still know your top three chemicals &gt;&gt; as someone who's seen so many of them. &gt;&gt; Okay. I feel like Okay, I can drop some. I I think Capsain's pretty good. &gt;&gt; Fire. Have you Have you You've You've tried it raw, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Was that brutal? &gt;&gt; Honestly, I mean, what's weird is pure capsain isn't as bad as if you diluted a bit in like ethanol. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, that sounds miserable. Like, if you were to tell me to have a shot of Everclear and some capsain, &gt;&gt; that sounds miserable. &gt;&gt; That's like a shoe nice video. &gt;&gt; That was actually one of my early projects. I I was before I even did YouTube, I distilled and made 100% ethanol and then I put a ghost pepper in it. &gt;&gt; Oh. &gt;&gt; And like the idea and then and then I heated it up. &gt;&gt; Like it's all the birds. When I took it, you're just like confused. Your body feels confused. &gt;&gt; You are like you're like shoe nice with a science degree. &gt;&gt; No. No. No. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You know shoe nice, right? &gt;&gt; I know who he is. &gt;&gt; Of course. He ate 1,000 pencil erasers. &gt;&gt; I mean toilet paper. You could do that for a short. You're the same guy. You're just so 20 energy drinks into one. Bro, &gt;&gt; the the difference is that he he is trying something he created. Is trying everything man has created. &gt;&gt; Wait, what is Capsain doing to your tongue? &gt;&gt; I can answer this. &gt;&gt; I don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] care about No, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; Capsain is not making the tongue spicy. It's removing the tongue spice tolerance. So, basically removes the shield. Imagine your tongue has full shields. It removes the shields &gt;&gt; like you're like you have to they broke your shield and you have &gt;&gt; they broke shield and then now whatever is hitting you is just hitting like full body shots. &gt;&gt; Damn it's 100 HP that's going to move fast. &gt;&gt; Lwig's one his true &gt;&gt; so it's like it could be. So I'll explain why it could be true. the molecule itself uh like I say attacks no interacts with pain receptors &gt;&gt; and it just I don't know exactly what it does to be that's what I'm saying like I thought it activated them but I don't know if it activates them or like you said like sensitizes them. I don't actually know what it's doing. So you're what you're saying could be true. &gt;&gt; Dude, this reminds me I was I was talking to someone earlier who knows you and they &gt;&gt; someone are they secret? Uh, &gt;&gt; depends on what they were saying. &gt;&gt; And And they were saying I was, it was last year at Open Sauce. I'm in the hotel room. Nile red. He's a Long Island Deep. He he he's &gt;&gt; Does this guy's name start with M? &gt;&gt; No. Different guy. He looks over at me and he says, "How do computers work?" &gt;&gt; Oh, this guy's name starts with an R. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; That happened. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, you're constantly asking questions like this. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. But so that that is one question. How does a computer work? &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Actually, I don't I can't tell you. It's zeros and ones. It's a series of on-off switches. &gt;&gt; No, but sure. But how do the onoff switches? Why do they turn on and off? &gt;&gt; Electricity, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Yeah, but it's just spontaneous. &gt;&gt; No, it's controlled, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Sometimes it's with vacuum tubes. &gt;&gt; So, the problem is I'll ask somebody Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it's like some people do generally know, but then you want to ask more details like I I don't know. You're going to have to ask this guy. It's like everyone I to be honest, I haven't put that much research into this. Yeah, you should because the first computers were just ticket machines. It's a binary zeros and ones, man. &gt;&gt; Okay, I get that. But it's like one I'm talking about like, you know, a gaming PC. &gt;&gt; It's just that how does it like how does &gt;&gt; I can't believe telling you how computers work, bro. It's I promise you it's not as complicated. &gt;&gt; Isn't it weird? You're running Windows on your computer or like whatever you have a Mac. &gt;&gt; That's like a program and then any program you run like a program in a program. How does that work? It's working because it executes code which uses electricity to do zeros and ones more. &gt;&gt; Do you think given &gt;&gt; Okay. Right. Can you accept that? I accept that we don't accept that. &gt;&gt; What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm accepting that these aren't touching. &gt;&gt; No, this is why it's not a good answer. &gt;&gt; The true scientific mind does not accept what he does not fully understand. &gt;&gt; You know why it doesn't help? It's not a good answer because you wouldn't be able to use that that information to make a computer. You would need more info. &gt;&gt; Yeah, but it's like you'd have to go deeper into how to make the ones and zeros do the thing you actually need them to do. It just does that, but it's multiplied by like a trillion. That's how we have a kid. &gt;&gt; It's crazy that that we're on this stage and Nigel can't answer this, but if we had a kid up here who was really good at redstone in Minecraft, he &gt;&gt; said &gt;&gt; 100%. Um, that actually Redstone is what did unlock the idea for me &gt;&gt; because the fact that they can make a calculator and a and like a TV in that &gt;&gt; it's like okay &gt;&gt; you see that there was a maybe this was a year ago but it was somebody had finally recreated running Minecraft inside of Minecraft &gt;&gt; because you can make a computer in Minecraft. &gt;&gt; This was this was a trend way before with Doom. Everyone was running Doom on whatever they could, right? That was the meme. I should I should add more. It's not just how like the software works. It's like &gt;&gt; the circuit board. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Itself like like all the parts. &gt;&gt; I don't know how that works. &gt;&gt; I'm with you. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm on your team in that confident, but I know as a fact given a millennia, you cannot rebuild the game. &gt;&gt; His explanation is not satisfactory. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's just like, okay, it's ones and zeros. Okay. What is the what is what is it? How does the transistor do? &gt;&gt; Why does he have that? &gt;&gt; And why do you have resistors and capacitors? It it it it changes the amount of electricity to turn the thing on or off using a semiconductor. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, why doesn't it just turn on and off constantly? &gt;&gt; Well, it does, but it it's being controlled through a semiconductor, which is uses &gt;&gt; What is a semiconductor? &gt;&gt; It uses silicon, right? Which is &gt;&gt; Well, not necessarily. &gt;&gt; Some sometimes it does. &gt;&gt; We got the chip right here. &gt;&gt; That's the chip right there. I've looked at [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] silicon diagrams cuz I was so pissed off. &gt;&gt; This guy seems much more knowledgeable about I was pissed off that I didn't know what this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] did. So, I just watched a bunch of videos and I learned all this kind of on on a level where I'm like, I kind of get it. But if I had to teach someone, you're stuck. &gt;&gt; We got to do something else. &gt;&gt; As abrasive as he is, he does love watching three-hour videos about stuff like this. &gt;&gt; I actually do that quite often and then I remembered nothing. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's hard. &gt;&gt; But I remember I remember that I should know it. &gt;&gt; I'm like, I I I saw this in depth, but I can't remember a single thing. &gt;&gt; Isn't that half the battle? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, okay. What? What? What? Let's Let's hit number two cuz I want to finish this list. &gt;&gt; Cap season was first. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh wow. We completely forgot where we were at and that's why we're we're professionals. &gt;&gt; Okay. This is normal. Bring it back. This is very normal. Yeah. &gt;&gt; We actually have been letting you talk quite a bit. &gt;&gt; You're letting you talk more than we let other guests talk. &gt;&gt; Oh wow. &gt;&gt; Cuz people are mad at us for that. &gt;&gt; But you're also fascinating. &gt;&gt; Let's go. Silence. Silence. &gt;&gt; No. Give us the number two. Get me killed. &gt;&gt; You were a number two I always say is broine. That was in my list &gt;&gt; and mercury. &gt;&gt; What's cool about bromine? &gt;&gt; Yeah. What's cool about broine? &gt;&gt; So bromine is the only non-metal liquid. Non-metal elemental liquid at room temperature. &gt;&gt; Oh metal element. &gt;&gt; We don't know [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about that. I said that I mean I understand. I understand what he said. &gt;&gt; It's a It's a H hallogen. So it's similar to chlorine. So &gt;&gt; Oh &gt;&gt; yeah. Does that &gt;&gt; would it also was one of his favorites. Yeah. It's kind It does what chlorine can do but like a little bit different. &gt;&gt; Can you have a bromine pool? &gt;&gt; Actually, people do brominate their pools. That was like because it's very similar to your pool. I'm going to brominate all over your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] face. I'm &gt;&gt; getting your brominated pool. &gt;&gt; So like spas and stuff. They used to sell like broine tablets instead of &gt;&gt; Is it more expensive? &gt;&gt; No, I think they got rid of it because it's like broine has some like lowle toxicity. It's always &gt;&gt; Woke always. &gt;&gt; Why is Woke not letting us play with Mercury at home? &gt;&gt; So Mercury is actually surprisingly safe. So &gt;&gt; that's what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; Bring back Mercury. &gt;&gt; You know why? I have [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] feelings. I have feelings in my teeth. And I I remember I was getting him. I was a teenager. &gt;&gt; You're not I mean &gt;&gt; what? &gt;&gt; You're slowly poisoning yourself and you will die. &gt;&gt; Right. And I'm like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I was They're like it's algamin. It's got mercury in it. I'm like what the &gt;&gt; why do they put that in her mouth? Okay. So, I can kind of tell you why. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Uh, basically before, you know, the modern age of like a lot of the materials that people discovered like &gt;&gt; plastics and other ceramics, &gt;&gt; if you drilled a tooth out and there was a hole in it. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; What would you fill it with? &gt;&gt; Paper shred. Paper shred paper that you have you have to be able to chew really hard things &gt;&gt; for a long period of time. &gt;&gt; It has to stay there for a long time. I would I would replace it with an elephant's tooth molded to fit inside my tooth. &gt;&gt; Not bad. But that would that How would you How would you because if there's cracks in it, that'll just lead to another cavity. You have to seal it. &gt;&gt; Oh. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; cement. &gt;&gt; What would you use? &gt;&gt; Cement. Cement will break apart and it cement. If acid will will slowly etch it away. &gt;&gt; Aluminum. &gt;&gt; That's also pretty reactive, &gt;&gt; dude. Have you ever bit aluminum? &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's terillings. It's terrible. &gt;&gt; That would hurt so bad. So, kind of the reasoning why the mercury amalgam was made is it's actually my friend's a a dentist and she was telling me that technically in many ways the mercury amalgam is still better than a lot of the like composites or like the ceramic stuff that they use nowadays. They just don't use it for like toxicity concerns and look, but it's like theoretically &gt;&gt; it is a very good &gt;&gt; Wow. So, we kind of just like we were goated for figuring that out so long ago. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I think it I think because you can mix it and it makes like it but it's kind of like a quick epoxy &gt;&gt; and then you put it in the tooth. It's like you can mold it. It slowly hardens so you can like shape it and I think when it I think when it solidifies it expands so it actually seals all the cracks as it expands. I could be wrong about that. And it's it becomes really hard. It's nonreactive. &gt;&gt; What are the risks of the mercury then? PE theoretically if you swallow it &gt;&gt; over time it can have some issue but I think it's like they've done studies and it's like virtually not undetectable. &gt;&gt; So you can put mercury back in the kids lunches at schools. It's no problem. &gt;&gt; I think that's different. But &gt;&gt; what they took it out of the they took out the asbestos. They took out the mercury. &gt;&gt; They still have Yeah, they still have the lead. &gt;&gt; When I went to school, I got my mercury sloppy joe and I said, "Thank you." &gt;&gt; And it was glowing so bad. &gt;&gt; Uh I mean I don't know that deep. I don't know too much about I think it like messes up your neurons. I think it makes you dumb. &gt;&gt; There's a neuron. &gt;&gt; But I think I remember them saying that the scary part about lead. I mean, you get any heavy metal, you get a lot of it. You just get like, you know, metabolic problems and you you'll you'll have acute poisoning and you have to go to the hospital. But like &gt;&gt; how cute? &gt;&gt; Very. But low levels, if you get lowle heavy metal poisoning like from lead, the problem is that &gt;&gt; you won't really notice. It just lowers the if you do it on a population scale, it lowers the average IQ by five. So it means that you lose all your geniuses and double the people on the very very low end. So it's like &gt;&gt; you it really hurts your society. &gt;&gt; We're losing one Tom Scott and we're getting two slimes. &gt;&gt; Isn't there a crazy Crazy. &gt;&gt; Two guys that know about computers. Oh no. &gt;&gt; There's a crazy theory about how in America because of the commonality of lead paint in gas. It was gasoline for the generation. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. In gasoline. And that that was a huge reason why crime rose in the United States. I doubt it &gt;&gt; because there's a Veritassium video. &gt;&gt; That guy's bald, right? He's here. &gt;&gt; No, he has hair. &gt;&gt; You're thinking of Michael Vsauce here. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you're thinking Michael here. different guy. &gt;&gt; He just dropped a vid. &gt;&gt; I get I get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on by these these chuckleheads because I don't watch a lot of YouTube. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; So they're Well, I guess I guess I just Why do we pump the brakes? Let's correct that. He watches a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ton of YouTube. It's okay. You watch &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I I watch I don't watch a bunch of like I I watch very specific YouTube. &gt;&gt; Like what? Like what? &gt;&gt; Uh Broki, he plays Aki in Street Fighter. &gt;&gt; That's very specific. &gt;&gt; You know what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; I don't know who that is, but it's very specific. That's great. &gt;&gt; He once watched like a 2-hour video on like motherboard testing. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; I do. Yeah, a lot of people do that, by the way. Anyway, so so there they come to me and like we're going to have Nile red on. I'm like, "Oh, that's the bald guy, right?" Like I don't know any of these. I don't know anything. And &gt;&gt; you cuz you actually met him. &gt;&gt; You show up, you look great. &gt;&gt; You already met me. It's like you did know me, but you forgot me. I &gt;&gt; did forget. I feel bad because you know why? I met Slimesicle right after and he had a wolf cut. The wolf cut was crazy. Slimes here. &gt;&gt; Why is that changing? Still has it. &gt;&gt; Still has it. Slimesicle. And And here we are again. &gt;&gt; And the ball keeps rolling. &gt;&gt; And the hurt people keep hurting. &gt;&gt; You know, you know, you're you're not in my phone algorithm or my computer algorithm. You're in my TV algorithm. &gt;&gt; So I get Nile Red videos on the TV. &gt;&gt; I was going to say, you know why that's good? &gt;&gt; Why is that? &gt;&gt; Uh I think you get more ads. &gt;&gt; Way more ads. &gt;&gt; You get like a TV level amount of commercial ads and they're unskippable. 10 10 like &gt;&gt; uns skippable. No, I'm not watching that. &gt;&gt; I'm clicking out every single time. &gt;&gt; Wait, why don't you have premium on your TV? &gt;&gt; I just I'm just lazy. &gt;&gt; I haven't logged in. &gt;&gt; That is so embarrassing. &gt;&gt; You logged in. &gt;&gt; Yeah, she's logged in. &gt;&gt; That's why zipper two. &gt;&gt; Zipper two is here. &gt;&gt; So, okay. Broine, mercury. It &gt;&gt; That's a good idea. &gt;&gt; I didn't want to leave this. I didn't want to leave this cuz I've seen you touch mercury. Can I just buy mercury and touch it and I'll be fine? Because I do want to do this. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If I don't have a cut. So the the danger with mercury is more breathing the vapor. So it's like and but when it's at room temperature, it doesn't let off that like much vapor. I wouldn't be like &gt;&gt; I wear my woke mask. &gt;&gt; I I I won't really stop it &gt;&gt; of the vapor. That doesn't stop the vapor. &gt;&gt; I don't think so. But they're very heavy. So they will like not they're not like flying in the air. But if you literally &gt;&gt; So Fouchy lied. &gt;&gt; That's why he rides around a &gt;&gt; mile takes a stance on Dr. Fouchy &gt;&gt; the Canadian. We have the border under the video. Now, &gt;&gt; I have I have a good question. Okay, so you remember the fires in California early in January. It was actually very close to us and uh my house was like just really really near the zone of that. And so what I did was they told us not to use the water. They told us not to drink with &gt;&gt; the water supply at the time cuz it was like burn. All this is burned. Whatever is burned, right? And they told us not to like cook with it or whatever. I would go home sometimes. I was sleeping at the office. I would go home and take a shower, &gt;&gt; which I think about it sometimes. &gt;&gt; What What is your question? You said I have a good question. &gt;&gt; My question is, was it bad? &gt;&gt; Probably. &gt;&gt; Probably dumbass question, bro. &gt;&gt; I don't even know what the risk is. &gt;&gt; If I ask again, can you can we roll like a better answer that would make me feel better, &gt;&gt; dude? &gt;&gt; I I don't even know what the risk was. Like what they were saying that you could have &gt;&gt; Well, I can't here. I can explain it. So, you know how like none of you is actually touching and you're made of holes? &gt;&gt; Yes. Well, all the bad chemicals in the water seaped into those holes. &gt;&gt; But the good news is it's not touching you. &gt;&gt; It's not actually touching you. &gt;&gt; Death isn't real. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; Nothing can live forever. You can't die in a car crash cuz you can never be touched by a car. &gt;&gt; I can't be touched by a stupid car. &gt;&gt; Why you die? &gt;&gt; Because you're not getting touched. &gt;&gt; No, I don't know. I don't know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; I think it's cuz you stop too suddenly &gt;&gt; cuz like if you could touch the wall cuz you go like through the car, right? &gt;&gt; Yes. Yeah. Yeah. And that's like the rare like if you punch a wall there's supposed to be one in trillion chance you can punch through it &gt;&gt; because it won't let you touch it. It just like you just &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Don't I mean it if they let us touch we could phase through and then we wouldn't worry about carr video. &gt;&gt; But you also couldn't even sit in the car &gt;&gt; punching a wall so it goes right through &gt;&gt; and I don't touch it. He would kill that. What do you watch on YouTube? You said you lambasted when he said he didn't watch YouTube which he lied. Yeah. Like you made a noise like oh my gosh how do you not watch YouTube? Well &gt;&gt; cuz I just figured you guys are YouTube guys. an hour look. I want to be so clear. I want to be so clear. He is a YouTube guy. He lays on his floor and watches YouTube for extended periods of time. &gt;&gt; We are all YouTube guys. And I'm wondering, are you a YouTube guy? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I probably primarily watch YouTube. Honestly, right now I feel like I go through phases where it's like I think this is kind of everyone. You your algorithm is good. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you just keep getting like good stuff and then eventually you're like it's just trash. &gt;&gt; Some people some people are getting Nile Red videos and some people are getting what if the Flintstones were in 2025 videos. It's different types of people. &gt;&gt; It's Sometimes it's just a great I'll be like, "Oh, like I'm so excited to watch everything." Like it just recommends like, you know, some documentaries. I don't know, like a bunch of cool science content. And sometimes it's just like I don't even know what it is. Just trash. Like it's not even necessarily brain rod. It's just like pointless. &gt;&gt; What would an example be? &gt;&gt; No, without like trying to light somebody up, but like &gt;&gt; Lwig Augren. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Lewig is on stream number 17. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I don't know if that I don't know, but I feel like in general I do just watch like probably a lot of science stuff. &gt;&gt; You know what I don't like about the algorithm is that it's time sensitive. So like my algorithm that I get at night time is always the same stuff and not the videos I get recommended during the day. &gt;&gt; So for example, every single if I open my phone to YouTube anytime after like midnight, Gotham chess, nothing else. &gt;&gt; It's night time. Yes. So, I have to break the hab, but it's hard to break the habit when like I still want to watch YouTube and fall asleep. &gt;&gt; So, when I open it, it's all those videos. I'm like, I now have to search &gt;&gt; make a new profile. &gt;&gt; I don't have an idea. &gt;&gt; You need a night profile. &gt;&gt; But if I make a new profile, it's like it's like, what happens if you dump slime on Legos? And I'm like, I don't want that either. &gt;&gt; You got to start fresh. You're starting new. You're level one. &gt;&gt; I just have to I have to use the search feature. Yes. &gt;&gt; And I don't have an idea. And I'm late. I want I want the idea to come from the algorithm. You didn't know this. the food it gives you &gt;&gt; cuz I I I just realized that after 11 p.m. all of a sudden YouTube starts feeding me full face it vods of Counterstrike players and it's because I've been just leaving them on while I fall asleep &gt;&gt; and but I don't get recommended them in the middle of the day and my TV algorithm is different than my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] phone algorithm. What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is that about? &gt;&gt; It know it knows &gt;&gt; maybe by time of day cuz maybe I watch TV at the same time of day but it very it knows me better than I know me. I get I &gt;&gt; do I get now red videos. I don't even know anything about science. &gt;&gt; I get it every night now. It's my night videos. His now red videos. &gt;&gt; Really? I'm the last thing you hear before you go to sleep. &gt;&gt; Yeah, every time. &gt;&gt; Beautiful. Just like that guy that made his uh &gt;&gt; You're going to fall asleep and you might not wake up. &gt;&gt; Dude, the purple gold videos is one of my favorite videos. Really? &gt;&gt; I love that video. &gt;&gt; Oh, I've seen that one. That video rules. &gt;&gt; I like made my own Red Bull. I was going to ask, do you ever just like see something at the store or like Taco Bell and you're just like, I could make that? &gt;&gt; I guess. Yeah, it depends. I'm not buy taco. &gt;&gt; That's like food. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. If I go make a taco at home, it doesn't taste like Taco Bell. There they use specific ingredients. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. You I'm sorry. I'm going to put you on blast right here. We talked about this before the show. &gt;&gt; He He can't do that. &gt;&gt; Make a Taco Bell taco. &gt;&gt; Have you seen this guy try to cook? &gt;&gt; I can cook. I just don't do it a lot. &gt;&gt; No, this guy. &gt;&gt; Oh, this guy. &gt;&gt; He The cookies you made. &gt;&gt; Were they ass? &gt;&gt; You mean the cookie? I made the cookies. &gt;&gt; The cookie. That was literally the first time I've ever made a cookie. I I know. I could tell. You should go on Master Baker. &gt;&gt; Actually, no. &gt;&gt; That would be fire. &gt;&gt; I will tell you. I've baked before. &gt;&gt; Wait. All &gt;&gt; people on Master Baker. &gt;&gt; Pancakes. &gt;&gt; Waffles. &gt;&gt; Pancakes and waffles. &gt;&gt; But from scratch. &gt;&gt; What's the best thing you can cook? &gt;&gt; Best thing I can cook. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You're trying to whine and dine me. &gt;&gt; I I just make butter chicken. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; butter chicken like like the Indian dish. You make an electric butter chicken. It's kind of the only thing I've ever tried to make. But &gt;&gt; I mean, that's &gt;&gt; How did you find How did you find that recipe? What made you start making You have it once and you were like, I'll start making &gt;&gt; I can tell you how. Basically, one day I was like, &gt;&gt; I'm sick and tired of bad butter chicken. &gt;&gt; He wanted to change the world. So, I looked up butter chicken recipe. &gt;&gt; You're putting Montreal on bus. &gt;&gt; It was the first result. &gt;&gt; That's crazy. And straight up, it is actually one of my favorite like &gt;&gt; as like an LA native. It's I've never had this problem. It's like butter chicken everywhere. It's just so good. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The butter chicken here is good. &gt;&gt; I I don't know. I've I've gone to places that say they're good butter chicken. I'll have to &gt;&gt; Oh, you're you're a snob about it. &gt;&gt; I'm a bit of a snob. I like that. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't trust any kebab [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to make all forms of chicken. &gt;&gt; Some people it's like too tomatoy. Other people it's like, yeah, it's not enough butter. &gt;&gt; Butter chicken nuggets. You ever try that? &gt;&gt; That would go. I would go. &gt;&gt; You're on to something. &gt;&gt; Red's butter chicken nuggets. &gt;&gt; It's a stegosaurus, baby. &gt;&gt; It's still a dinosaur. &gt;&gt; This is a genius. &gt;&gt; This is a really good idea. You're actually I'm inside the short now. &gt;&gt; I guess I will have to steal the recipe of that person that I found. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then you combine it with the recipe for diamond. &gt;&gt; You know, you can't patent a recipe, right? Oh, hell yeah. You know, you know how that works is what you can copyright or or make yours is the co like talking about it. Like so you can be like, "My grandma loved these dino chicken nuggets." And that's why there's always like exposition and editorializing to make that piece their own. &gt;&gt; That was in the old days when people wrote [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] though. No one. No one really does that anymore. &gt;&gt; That's why Plankton wants to steal the recipe so bad cuz if he can steal it, he faces no legal rep. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; That's right. There's no way for the copyright law to protect Mr. Krabs. &gt;&gt; This is kind of like YouTube. I was in the creator bus on the way over here and there was a creator behind me. I don't know who it was, but they were just like, "Bro stole my whole video." &gt;&gt; I was like, I have to imagine that's like half the conversations here &gt;&gt; for maker YouTubers just constantly getting their ideas stolen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I mean, the thing with &gt;&gt; for me it doesn't happen that often cuz obviously the stuff I do is like either I think on the blue channel like stupid or on the red channel it's just like &gt;&gt; too much effort. &gt;&gt; But it is every so often where there'll be like I want to make something and then I spend the next I'm not constantly working on it but I spend like two years working on it. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; Like on off we &gt;&gt; Yeah. Like on and off and then it's like finally I'm like I'm going to finish it. I finally finish it and then I go on YouTube and some guy's like, "Oh yeah, I just posted a video on it." I'm like, "Really?" &gt;&gt; What's an example of something that took two years of buildup? &gt;&gt; I mean, kind of everything I'm working on right now. &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; I've been trying to make magnets. &gt;&gt; Uh, I've been This actually did finish turning air into alcohol. &gt;&gt; So fire. &gt;&gt; I want to make my own tungsten cubes. I haven't actually. &gt;&gt; Why do these things take so long? Are you like interlocking projects? Is it because you can only work on certain things at certain stages at certain times? Like why? &gt;&gt; A lot of honestly a lot of it is just like for certain things there's just like lead times like if you're building something there's one that for example the air to alcohol it's a lot of variables to manage and like sometimes you go to buy a part and you're like I need this one part and then you go and you find the only company that sells it and they're like yeah it's 8week lead time and you're like okay so I'm not working on this for the next two months. So, how do you have projects pl like when you think about the videos you're releasing for this year or next year? Do you have things planned out all the way through then? You have things that are in the process? &gt;&gt; Yeah, there there's always like something. How &gt;&gt; how many projects are you juggling right now? &gt;&gt; I think the It sounds ridiculous, but it's funny cuz I'll I'll say it, but like the first time that I would say the number, it was in my head. I'm like, "Oh, that's cool. That's so many projects." But now I've realized it's like no, it's miserable. &gt;&gt; Uh I think it was like 23. &gt;&gt; Holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 23 like long form. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But then I was like, wait, I only post like two a year. This is like 10 years of &gt;&gt; content. &gt;&gt; They're all going to hit at once. &gt;&gt; But that that So that's actually they're all kind of finishing. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So I have four now in the backlog. &gt;&gt; Do you do you do you prefer to like just once those four go out keep working or do you like I'll take a break cuz I have &gt;&gt; No, I'm I'm honestly I'm just trying to finish everything that's been in the backlog for like two years. So, like when you get through the whole backlog, you'll have you're not you're not going to release them all at once. &gt;&gt; I've told myself I won't add anything new. I'm just literally finishing everything I started. &gt;&gt; Wait, and then what happens? &gt;&gt; Well, and then Nile Red Gaming. &gt;&gt; No, no, stop. What happens? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; N Red Nile Red reacts. &gt;&gt; You take break &gt;&gt; in 10 years. Yeah, &gt;&gt; cuz it'll So, I mean, like this is like &gt;&gt; I mean this is a serious question. &gt;&gt; Yeah. No, no. I mean, this is a serious question. Like, cuz I like watching Nile Red videos and I think &gt;&gt; this is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] serious. &gt;&gt; What are you doing? Put the fidget spinner away. &gt;&gt; Put the fidget spinner away. &gt;&gt; It's really fun. &gt;&gt; So, you have 23 videos in your pipeline. It's going to take you who knows. Yeah. 5 years, 10 years. A long time to finish them. &gt;&gt; I'm hoping to actually finish them in like two years. All of them. &gt;&gt; So, in two years, you finish 23 23 of these projects you've been working on. And then what happens? Are you going to add another 10? I think it's like as I get to the end, you start to that's when you start to put on the gas a little bit. &gt;&gt; No. Yeah. Well, you add like you trickle in a few more. But I think in general, I've thought about that some of the revenue, it's just so unsustainable to try to make them. &gt;&gt; I mean, I think I have to find &gt;&gt; We just hired a guy or a friend of mine to like try to help out and he's helped a lot, but it's like some of these big projects it's like just straight up like too much to think about and we start stacking all of them together. It's just kind of unsustainable to I think like live a reasonable life and try to have to manage all it on my own. No, &gt;&gt; even with like a bit of help. &gt;&gt; How big is your team? &gt;&gt; Uh, five total, but only one of them works with me on the projects, but it's still like I'm still doing all the decision- making and it's like he's not an engineer. So, I mean, I'm not an engineer. &gt;&gt; Do you edit your own videos? &gt;&gt; I have help with for editing. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Will you will you make videos forever until you die? &gt;&gt; I don't know. at one time. I think so. Probably. &gt;&gt; Nice. &gt;&gt; That's cool. Hell yeah. &gt;&gt; Like I feel like it's one of our rl do projects forever. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; How did how did you know because you said you were still a lab tech when you posted your first video, right? So how long did it take you &gt;&gt; to go fulltime and like how do you how do you make the decision that okay this is my new gig in life direction versus what you were. So the very like quick version was I posted in 2014 and then I quit that lab tech job and I actually went on vacation touring. I went around just traveling around the world for like 4 months. Came back, got a a job at a grocery store. And then I was like, "Okay, I need to like figure out what I'm doing." So I actually got a I started a master's degree in chemistry and that went on for like seven months. And that kind of taught me I'm like, "I don't want to do this." And during that time, I was like, why would I do this when I'm like doing my own chemistry? &gt;&gt; Then right after that, I started a Patreon &gt;&gt; and I was making between YouTube and the Patreon, it was like minimum wage. So I'm like, hell yeah. I I can never justify getting a minimum wage job. Well, it doesn't really count because that's the total revenue. And so like &gt;&gt; the total revenue was minimum wage and to me that was &gt;&gt; close enough. Yeah. &gt;&gt; That was like when I said I'm going to do this for one year and see where it goes. So then by 2017 I was like I mean it seems to have grown. I unless it starts going down I'm going to keep doing this. &gt;&gt; So by 2017 you're making more than minimum wage. &gt;&gt; It still wasn't that much but it was kind of like it was probably I would say like maybe 20 I would say like between 20 and I don't remember now but like 20 and 50% more. So now I'm like I think I was making the equivalent salary as if I got a grad student job. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So I was like wow. &gt;&gt; Like 40k a year. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They It's not It's not a lot. &gt;&gt; So maybe it was like double minimum wage. But either way, I I don't know what the numbers are now, but I was just like, "Okay, well now I can't justify going back to grad school." So &gt;&gt; because you just wind up with the job that's making equivalent or less. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It was like work that I might not like as much. So like I'm just going to keep &gt;&gt; Yeah. Sounds like you kind of just like, well, I guess I'll keep going. Well, I guess I'll keep going. &gt;&gt; Then 2018, I rented like a lab space &gt;&gt; and then I hired my brother. And even that time, we're like, yeah, this might just be fun for a couple years. We'll just go until the money runs out. &gt;&gt; Older brother, younger brother &gt;&gt; on younger. Okay. &gt;&gt; When did things actually blow up? &gt;&gt; I It was 2019. Like we My brother talks about this. It was right before VidCon of 2019. We posted a video on turning old jewelry into gold. &gt;&gt; Not turning it, purifying the gold out of old jewelry. And basically the views and revenue on that if you looked at the metrics was like this is the metric and then for three days it was like like mount numbers &gt;&gt; as soon as you hit that. Is the next video a banger? &gt;&gt; No. Not really. But it just kind of was like actually sorry. Sorry. Right before that was I posted one called aluminum and mercury. That was late 2017. That's actually &gt;&gt; about how your kids can eat mercury and it's actually fine. &gt;&gt; When I did that I was like oh my god I can actually like this I remember I remember it pretty vividly. like this could go somewhere, but it still went back to the we'll see what happens. Then it was 2019 with the gold one that I'm like, oh my god. &gt;&gt; I think this is like &gt;&gt; I've won the game. &gt;&gt; Well, I was like I still had no idea what I was doing. But I really did feel like I could actually build something out. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that makes sense. &gt;&gt; What's the most money you spent on some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; You bought some crazy gadgets. &gt;&gt; I cannot &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; What do you mean you can't say you guys? &gt;&gt; Can you tell us how much it was? Like can you tell them how much it was and then tell us what it is? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Like what parts the Okay. Okay. How much is it? &gt;&gt; So I'm I'm working on a project now. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Where there's a whole part where it's another turning. Actually I &gt;&gt; I can just say what it is actually cuz the next video that I'm posting I mention it like &gt;&gt; I mean should I &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; It's up to you. &gt;&gt; Mr. Beast leaked a video on this podcast a year. He leaked the entire You can decide if you want us to censor it. I've I've throughout my YouTube career, I I just like would arbitrarily keep things secret, but I think now it just like doesn't matter. So, yeah. So, I still have that hesitency. Basically, &gt;&gt; the followup my brother and I want to do like this whole series of just turning air into things. So, one we want to do is turning air into diamond. So, to do that, you need to like I mean sequester uh stuff from the air, turn it into methane gas, and then use that to grow a diamond. And originally I was going to just I was like I'm going to build my own diamond grower and but I realized that would probably never work. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then I found a good deal on a diamond machine. What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is a diamond? &gt;&gt; A diamond machine turns stuff into diamond. It's like a chemical diamond. &gt;&gt; You can grow diamond. &gt;&gt; No, it's actually pretty complicated. And even now the whole industry is kind of exploding and it's like kind of complicated and difficult to make money. If you're gonna propose to your girl, you have to ask if she wants a natural diamond or a lab grown diamond. And most will switch to no lab grown. &gt;&gt; Natural concerns with the natural diamonds in the diamond farming industry. Kids in AK-47. &gt;&gt; I bet he's got a couple kids in the garage making the diamonds. So, &gt;&gt; the kids work on the machines. &gt;&gt; The kids could not work on the machines. They're too complicated. &gt;&gt; So, how much you teach the kids a lot these days? Wait, wait. How much is this diamond growing machine? &gt;&gt; Actually, now that I think of it, sorry, I I can Yeah, I can just tell you what it was. I got a really good deal cuz like a lot of diamond growing machines, people say it's like it's probably like they they were usually quoted like 200k US. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; For the machine &gt;&gt; usually. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But then I randomly found one that was uh &gt;&gt; Facebook got it for &gt;&gt; lightly used 85. &gt;&gt; 85k. &gt;&gt; How can with your hands can you show me how big it is? &gt;&gt; Oh, it's not that big. I thought it was room size. &gt;&gt; Can Can you just make the Hope diamond and sell it for 20 billion? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; It's actually difficult to make big diamonds &gt;&gt; because it'll like break apart. &gt;&gt; I don't actually know the true reason, but basically to grow a diamond, you need a diamond seed. And to get a diamond What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Wait, is that real? &gt;&gt; Is this Zelda? &gt;&gt; Diamond seed. &gt;&gt; A diamond kind of like the the analogy I'd give is kind of like making sourdough bread. &gt;&gt; Oh, you need a starter? &gt;&gt; Yes. You need a starter. Where's like It's kind of like where did the first sourdough start? &gt;&gt; San Francisco. Actually, &gt;&gt; no. &gt;&gt; It's the diamond seat. &gt;&gt; So, the You're the first sourdough start. &gt;&gt; Stay on track. Don't Don't get distracted. We need to make diamonds. &gt;&gt; No, we need to say we need to stay on this trend. &gt;&gt; We need to make diamonds. &gt;&gt; What is the diamond scene? &gt;&gt; So, basically, I think the original ones came from natural diamonds. So they would like with a laser they slice a very thin just square of diamond and then from that if you put a you have to put plasma over it with you shoot methane and hydrogen in that's just one of the methods and it will slowly grow and deposit diamond deposit diamond on it and slowly grow from there and you'll end up with like a diamond cube. &gt;&gt; I thought you compress carbon &gt;&gt; that's another method. &gt;&gt; Oh disgustingly huge expensive machine. That's a more expensive. &gt;&gt; That's high pressure, high temperature. &gt;&gt; And does that make a better diamond? &gt;&gt; I think technically it's lower quality, but it's faster. &gt;&gt; You can also make that with his ass. &gt;&gt; If I squeeze hard enough. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We make a diamond. How many rooms in your home are just full of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like machines and chemicals and &gt;&gt; I don't I don't put all this in my home. &gt;&gt; We have an office. That's so cool. &gt;&gt; An office space. &gt;&gt; Do you Dude, I was going to ask you, do you are what's your thoughts on time crystals? M &gt;&gt; genuinely &gt;&gt; I have zero thoughts. What are you What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; It's a state of &gt;&gt; It's a state of matter. Don't you know about this? There are seven states of matter. One of his time crystals. &gt;&gt; Is this what you watch on YouTube? &gt;&gt; Dude, it's real. I'm You're going to go home and you're going to be like, I'm so dumb. &gt;&gt; Time cryst is a time crystal, &gt;&gt; brother. I'm with you. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. You're talking about like like the like the the things they put in watches to keep time. &gt;&gt; No. No. faster. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I was going to say like &gt;&gt; Okay, you're not. So, you're actually talking about &gt;&gt; what is a time crystal? &gt;&gt; Uh, a novel phase of matter that exhibits a repeating pattern of motion over time. Unlike regular crystals which repeat in space, time crystals repeat in time. It's a state of matter. &gt;&gt; What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; It's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] freaky, man. &gt;&gt; He's he's watching the &gt;&gt; in condensed matter physics is a quantum system of particles whose lowest energy state is one of the particles. &gt;&gt; Who is this guy? &gt;&gt; Okay, what section of YouTube is he? &gt;&gt; That's Wikipedia. I was reading Wikipedia. Yeah, but did you learn this on YouTube? &gt;&gt; No. No. Someone told me about them. &gt;&gt; And he actually sold me three. &gt;&gt; But I can't give them out. &gt;&gt; It is a state of matter like liquid gas or plasma, but it's also time crystals. It's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] real. &gt;&gt; Here's the thing, slime. I think you think because Nile Red is in a science sphere &gt;&gt; that he just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] knows and gives a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about time. &gt;&gt; I was going to say, you guys ask me a lot of questions have nothing to do with chemistry. if you feel like it kind of has to do with chemistry. Am I crazy? &gt;&gt; We were talking about crystals to be fair. Yeah. &gt;&gt; State of matters do. Also, it's kind of like asking, hey, you know, do you play Valerant if you play Counterstrike? Very similar, &gt;&gt; is it? So, okay. So, one thing, so this is one thing I'll say that I think is kind of interesting. &gt;&gt; When I was going to say when science first began, &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; right, you know, we'll go all the way back to the beginning of science. &gt;&gt; When Newton had the apple &gt;&gt; even &gt;&gt; actually. Yeah. Capernicus, &gt;&gt; you were just I think they just said you were like a like a natural philosopher. &gt;&gt; I think that's what it was. Like you were just like a guy who like thought about things, I guess. &gt;&gt; Uh so there wasn't a division between chemistry and physics. You were just like I don't know it was just stuff you thought about. &gt;&gt; It was just the field of thinking. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Over time, &gt;&gt; people were like, "No, chemistry is more of this thing." And as it got more complicated, like physics is more of this. And we still have like this blended area where it's like physical chemistry, which is like lasers and &gt;&gt; it could So on one side you have like pure physics, the other side's chemistry, and then there's physical chemistry. And it's like I do more on the chemistry side. &gt;&gt; I game at you with a physics question. &gt;&gt; So but but it could be physical chemistry is what you're talking about. And that's &gt;&gt; that's what makes mom math. That's good. That's good. &gt;&gt; So, I I understand the misunderstanding. &gt;&gt; We're going to Me and Nile, Red are going to make a new type of weapon. We're We're going to make a new type of chemical and we're going to make you drink it. &gt;&gt; It's going to hurt. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, I didn't mean to come at your neck. I do have another question. Do you remember um do you have in your head your biggest hater? &gt;&gt; Do you read comments, but your com your your content's like pretty norm like innocuous, right? It's hard to hate on &gt;&gt; the Nile black you. &gt;&gt; I know. &gt;&gt; I think that like I remember I don't know about you guys like &gt;&gt; haters. &gt;&gt; No, no, but when you first start content, there's a time where you have no haters &gt;&gt; because you're community small and you're like, "Man, I'm just unhatable &gt;&gt; and you're growing. You're on top of the world. Everyone loves you and you're getting bigger and it's like it's like, wow." &gt;&gt; Yes. And then one day you just get a comment like, "This guy sucks." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Like this guy looks stupid, sounds stupid, and is dumb. This guy sucks at basketball. &gt;&gt; You're surprisingly bad at a sport that you've talked about a lot. &gt;&gt; I think I think what happens is I mean it's fun or maybe permissible to dunk on a big guy and you're a big guy. &gt;&gt; Well, I think also what I would always notice is when your video goes to like it hits in part of the algorithm that's like not your audience. &gt;&gt; So you have people who just don't care. They're just they just watch the video and just they don't get it. &gt;&gt; This video happened to them is the way I comment. This happens with uh this happens with shorts way more often. Like they can break out further. And I remember we have one like this where we're making a joke about the Nintendo Switch game ARMS, which is not a great game, and we're talking about how it's funny that Tommy in it hit up Lwig to play it. This reached this reached far beyond our audience. It's it's a really boring, nonsensical Tik Tok. &gt;&gt; But did it make people mad? But yeah, and they're like, "Who are these three [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] making fun of arms?" Like, it just it is the most mean comments I've ever seen on one of our videos. And it's just that &gt;&gt; that's so interesting. I didn't know we had that. &gt;&gt; And that's their only exposure is they love ARMS. And we are hating people who are making fun of people who really like that game. &gt;&gt; But what do your hater comments even say? &gt;&gt; Uh, some people just like they don't like the way I talk. They don't. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Some people some of the hate I mean with everyone some of the hate doesn't I'm not really sure what it means. &gt;&gt; Do you ever get hate from the science community? &gt;&gt; Uh so I did years ago. Um I think I remember on Twitter like I was just getting some hate from some people and it was just kind of confusing because some of the hate they said didn't really sound like it didn't sound like they were hating me. It sounded like they were hating the idea of me. M &gt;&gt; so one of them was like I hate that this I don't agree with his comment anyway his implication but he's like I hate he goes Nio Red isn't smart and I hate that everyone I work with thinks that and I'm like and I was just like he goes he's actually dumb and I'm like wait okay I don't agree that like you say so they said he's like some genius I'm like I don't agree with that but also like it sounds like you have some petty beefs with your co-workers &gt;&gt; I just want my co-workers to think I'm smart to it sounds like it's like I'm not really part of it. No, &gt;&gt; this is a guy like all his co-workers laugh and talk about your videos and he's like over in the corner of the break room like &gt;&gt; and he doesn't get it. He doesn't like it and he finds your video to comment that. &gt;&gt; It's to me it was like I never I I never really watch Game of Thrones for example. &gt;&gt; Same. &gt;&gt; And when it was big and everyone would be talking about it, I'd be like, "Guys, that show's dumb." Like I would just be like, "I'm so left out that I I'm going to just be a hater." &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's how &gt;&gt; I've actually never experienced that. &gt;&gt; He's almost exclusive. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. Why even? &gt;&gt; That one was for the kid that the the fans at home. Look how mad he got. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The fans at home love. &gt;&gt; Do you have a dream collab? I don't know. You don't really do collabs, do you? &gt;&gt; So, for the longest time, I never did because I don't know. I had like visions and ideas of how my content would go. &gt;&gt; He bottled fart with Charlie the other day. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I've been I've been doing more collabs, but I like I don't mind I like doing it on other people's channels. Kind of like what I said. We did a Q&amp;A and someone asked like if what we think about collabs and stuff and I was like I like the ones where I don't have to do any of the editing and I just show up and a video appears on the internet like this. &gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, happy contributed to that. &gt;&gt; That was fake. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; The one with you and Charlie? &gt;&gt; What do you mean it was fake? &gt;&gt; They tried to make fart ice. &gt;&gt; Well, we tried to freeze the fart. &gt;&gt; Free. They were trying to freeze the farted for it. That that was the issue for me. Their fart was so bad. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we um &gt;&gt; you got weak fart. &gt;&gt; They had weak ass fart. &gt;&gt; We I was promised a big game. &gt;&gt; I could honestly I could introduce you to a guy &gt;&gt; who could really your company. &gt;&gt; It was insane. &gt;&gt; The guy's lactose intolerant. He literally drank milk and nothing happened. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he got stage fright or something. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I told him like, "Dude, I don't believe you're lactose intolerant." &gt;&gt; So, you got this you got this chemist in the building. He's working with like peanuts. He's working with the weakest fart you've ever heard. &gt;&gt; We got a video for you. Sure. &gt;&gt; Uh, &gt;&gt; we'll put this on the screen for the audience. &gt;&gt; This was this morning. &gt;&gt; Where's what coming from? &gt;&gt; Use a mic. Actually, no, it's fine. We'll put it on the screen. &gt;&gt; Why do you have this recorded &gt;&gt; slower? The hotel room. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Do you have a digestive issue? &gt;&gt; How How are you doing that? &gt;&gt; I don't know. &gt;&gt; I don't know, man. &gt;&gt; Does it keep going? &gt;&gt; I don't know. &gt;&gt; Scared. &gt;&gt; I just wanted you to let you know that. That's impressive. That's impressive. I don't think I have a digestive issue. They have an awesome diet. I know you have digestive issue. When I met Slime, he told me a story once about how he had a Domino's pizza that he believes stayed inside of his body for for years and years and coated his intestines in a way that changed the way he poops. And good or bad. &gt;&gt; In a bad way. In a way that soiled and made his his farts and poops rotten forever. &gt;&gt; Chemistry on that. I think it was when I was 21 and it was it was the Domino's on North Avenue in Grand Junction, Colorado, if it's still there. And uh I ate a whole pizza myself and it changed the way I shhat and farted for I think eight years. I think you it was just like covered in bacteria or something. &gt;&gt; But I think I think &gt;&gt; like changed your entire gut biome. &gt;&gt; I think it did. But I think it came back like I think right now I've hit like this normalized &gt;&gt; He now thinks he can control the smell of his fart. &gt;&gt; I do. I I don't feel &gt;&gt; Wait, how how is it though like as somebody you So you have very smelly farts. Is that what I'm gathering? &gt;&gt; The thing is &gt;&gt; if he decides to is if I &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what I'm Okay. He thinks he can decide if it smells or not. &gt;&gt; I can I can choose &gt;&gt; podcast anymore &gt;&gt; and everyone calls me [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stupid and they say I'm dumb and they say you can't do that. &gt;&gt; You can withhold the the the methane release. &gt;&gt; It's like a flashbang. I can choose the flashbang or I can choose the &gt;&gt; flashbang really is a binary. It's either banging or it's not. &gt;&gt; No. Flashbang versus H. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Damage. &gt;&gt; Damage or no damage? &gt;&gt; So, what do you think about that? &gt;&gt; I, you know, the B human body is an incredible thing. &gt;&gt; It's so incredible, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Incredible. &gt;&gt; Beautiful even. &gt;&gt; And um who am I to doubt this? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Thank you.
