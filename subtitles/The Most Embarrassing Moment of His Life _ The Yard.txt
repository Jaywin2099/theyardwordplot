 wubby took our yard postcard some you make up when we don't send them dude wub wubby took all the postcard we actually did man all this Sushi dude so good what you got there is that a roll spicy mail over here don't look at me don't don't don't look at just seaweed and and rice just stop just please new guy new guy they were $40 do you guys like them I know you're say I going say okay this guy Aiden pulls up in these shoes and he's like oh I guess Barney's here I guess Barney I guess Barney's here kill gri for those but then if he says they were $40 I'd be like well that's a bargain what can you say about it that's that you wouldn't say you got you spent $40 to buy garbage shoes to buy Barney shoes I hate you because you spend a load of money how much that sweater cost Let's Do It come on right here right now I don't know I bought I don't know I don't the price I bought it like four years ago I don't can we stop for a moment to make fun of Aiden okay all right absolutely we don't do that enough on this show I think it's a missing feature uh the Tik Tok dude I'm annoyed about the Tik Tok can we watch it zipper do you know what we're talking about it's in the group chat zipper you're 1 million people have sent this to me I'm not dumb okay I to be fair I haven't seen it so I would like to see it you haven't seen it that's really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up of you as my friend cuz I sent something in the chat yeah but it has Aiden in it so I default don't want to watch itad like I watch anything you send me unless it's Aiden was somehow roped into a man on the street interview I'm assuming in downtown Tennessee wait blood got roped on [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] where one roped on camera in Los anges La it was in la la it was at a bar called 4100 and he was wearing at the outfit that I would cast Aiden in as himself in a movie about Aiden I was in the aan outfit and art Department I kind of asked for it in a in a way cuz I saw this guy outside like uh not not setting up exactly but he was with a cameraman and somebody else and I was just curious what what he was going to do so you man he wasn't filming recording yet and this this guy Kyle Kyle Keller who was nice I we had a little conversation we were talking about like him filming shorts and stuff and then he was like do you want to do it like you me what I'm sorry go ahead shorts and Tik to sorry he's probably are toan as hum probably my exact height he's the same height as you slim he's the same height as you why that's I can't you know what's just the same he's not doing himself any favors with this C this is his content he's making himself look like he comes in a package okay you and if he's the same height as me you are not allowed to be this mean to people I'm not being mean what if he's just a 5 foot one guy he's also not 5 foot one he's the same height as you're making the defense based off the facts that that hey you're saying if he was even if he was 5 for there were 5 for one people out there this is what I say that changes things if he's five I think we should kill him in response I always say this to protect the gene pool I always say this cuz I have short friends and I say that you can beit I have short [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 63 can say because short friends you don't need to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] walk around like yeah yeah man boy I have short friends 510 men said by it's you're saying I got gay friends you're at the man I have short I you can be spiritually short which is the worst of all and that and but if you're spiritually tall you overcome anything that's what I said what don't laugh at my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] don't laugh at my beautiful words I just said don't make fun of every being short I'm not making fun of bring Spirits you're bring him [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Spirits oh does Spirit not count doesn't count to you watch video what does this program output the program that says hello world hello world idea l no idea no idea that's crazy okay this is this is what I said this is what I said I don't know cuz I don't know anything about programming except like gen like very general knowledge like oh what what language is this in is it going to like print something on paper is it going to like put a me like text up on a website like why would I know I have zero context this this is simply a I didn't watch enough TV thing because this is like the Who Wants To Be A Millionaire first five questions question like you know those questions that are like you get those are free ones this is just the programming version of that question that's why you're being asked it and the fact that you don't know it is funny because of that it's like you're saying his name is like Jeff Simpson I was even the first person he asked have no frame of reference for what this is going to be or what the question is yeah you whiffed hard and the answer for people playing at home was hello world what does it do L without the quotes one of the two things there if I type that into if I if I put that into the command prompt does it just send hello world back to me is that what all it isex yeah yeah print in this context means to display exactly but why would I have that context because again you just watch enough TV to that like SNS into the general knowledge of your Cloud but you didn't because you weren't allowed to play teen games I get it I'm not making fun of you many so many people said this to me it has been said to me so many times what's funny is I think that's most of the views on it because the actual real is just an ad so it's not like performing incredibly well cuz it's like yeah anyway coding's easy you should learn to code with me and that's kind of the whole point I don't think that it's funny because it's common knowledge you should know I think it's funny because I think deductively you should have figured it out you think yes I think if it says print hello world and he says what is it output PR could also mean output basically whole point of his reel was to show how easy coding is but I don't know that either proxy very simp also would have said yes if I knew it was an ad but to his credit it's paying out P off so it is an ad it's an it's an ad for a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] coding lessons thing and then he like told he like plugs it at the end of the the end of the short Kyle I hope you got your bag I I enjoyed I enjoyed meeting Kyle so I will say no shade on you my mom tried to teach me coding for about five months and I was horrible she codes I'm yeah what she code Tetris she's a software engineer for hulet Packard oh my God perhap you've heard of them that's so cool yeah that is cool she's so cool and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Masters in Business she's so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] interesting the emotions out of lwig when she hacked him like G really freaking breathtaking look she is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] breathtaking all the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] time also it maybe it wasn't his mom sorry I'm looking up because we were

adolescent boys were expected to enter into a mentor relationship with an adult man okay yeah what do they call them's mine kind think you're the adult man I think you need to go find a boy no I find an adulter man you have you read the book uh song of Achilles no it's about his boy lover Patrick Le oh that's right and how because you're supposed to give up your boy lover and he never did no it's it was very unco to give up to not give up your boy we go to like a like a Greek Town let's go to Baltimore we'll go to Baltimore we'll go to Great town why and when do you give them up when they is it when they leave Boyhood you're going to love that yeah it's exactly when they when they're not a boy right cuz then they're not your boy lover he kind ofed here thing when so that when they're a boy and they're your boy lover it's chill but when they're a man it's gay it is it why you was a man that's like get a wife another man exactly you know you know the casino in Detroit that we would go to during big house rip uh that was Greek Town and they would [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me raw every time right yeah oh cuz they knew they smelled it on you they no they knew that I was capping you smell they smelled it on you they knew that I was capping about one their own yeah they were like well he we're going to we're going to make him learn today um but yeah that's great thank you for coming to my seminar didn't expect to learn so much today have you taken it yet 23 and me yeah no get to spitting lad SP spit in the thing for me spit for me I I know spit on it you well you think you know I'm pretty sure I know blood spit on it you find out and then maybe you weren't sure I'm like I'm I'm like all the other British kids with bad haircuts and bad teeth what do you want he's he's the evidence is overwhelmingly in that direction check in the mail for like 14 cents for every Arctic Monkeys album that ever went on Spotify nothing would be more disappointing than cracking open the 23 and me and then seeing exactly what I think it'll be which is like 70% English oh good but maybe maybe you're Greek too maybe you'll figure out why you're such a Euro like maybe it'll and maybe it'll have some information regarding like your potential like maybe say like hairline stuff lactose stuff like it can have like other I don't think you're concerned about the lactose yeah the any of them he would come in his pants if he was Dutch oh my God he he's like oh I'm from oh I'm Swiss is there a country that if you find out that's your genetic makeup they you have an easier time for citizenship like if you find out like you're like an orphan in America but you're a 100% Estonian are they like welcome welcome home Bubba welcome home you and puppy from I already there's a few countries that give you it if your grandparent is from there It Italy's one of them ital's one of them you make that up I already checked but I already tried you just lie make up a make a grandma.com what if you just get a like no like I'm sure you could pay an Italian grandmother to be your guardian oh and then does that count cut the line or marry her 100% yeah you marry an old ass Grand [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out I become Italian you don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with Italy me neither but for different reason you think anyone ever nut in the 23 in me vial on accident and send it in I think they did it not they were like I won't read the instruction I'm just like they took out the V they didn't read it and they were like oh I'm supposed to n you must have to nut into it cuz like where else is my where else is my jeans DNA coming from I got to send them my my SP maybe it be more accurate imagine you get it as a gift for Christmas you're dumb you know you don't know what you don't know what jeans are you're like oh I must mean kids yeah yeah and you in the vial and you send it off and you send it off and of course at the 23 Center they drink it that's how they test everything and they I don't know how your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] look be hard to get nut in that vial oh yeah well you no I imagine you do some sort of like paper funnel like no you do like a a method you like over the toilet you just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's a very tiny hole no if I remember I don't think you have nut directly into it though it's like got an opening like you could cap it on the tip of your hog and then bounce the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] into your you could do it it'd be it' be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we don't have to nut directly into it boys there's technology for this like we could roll up a piece of paper yeah but then it like get like a funnel you have to like spray with canola oil have you seen the thing that picks up liquids you could pick up your C with it you know what I'm talking about can you look up ketchup pick up Appliance wait wait the rly thingy yes I've seen this dude we we could make like a Slap Chop commercial but like clean up your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this is this is this is the kid you this is the whest kids you know B is it well did it but also I think but to toilet paper works fine no no no cuz cuz toilet paper smears it and toilet paper does not work that is a classic misconception toilet paper it's the gray it's the gray right now it's that is exactly what my nut looks like look at that but that's crazy oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and it puts it back wait dude that would definitely pick up my C pick up your nut and put it on your friend's desk oh my God just right on Aiden's forehead holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dude oh oh c uh subaki made the yeah that makes sense yeah wait and then you could still he he made the razor headset you still got it you know you and then you can throw it on a cling and then you send it in WoW n they definitely made that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we get one of these yeah 100% I think we how much the the sdle costs we can use our credit card points got so many credit card points I've been racking them up for the compy I don't work anymore lowkey Nick is bad at games highkey highkey yeah I'll be brave man I've been relishing this past week after beating the god gamer challenge did you watch session one huh did you watch session one uh I watched the last one that was session two I saw some of session one this is what happened on on run five of session one we got six games in and then after the we then we killed the stream we're like we'll play tomorrow it already late Alex messages me he goes hey the challenge is too easy let's make it let's make it harder let's remove like most of the shooters and let's just put games you don't play and I said okay and I realized that Alex doesn't really want to win the challenge I don't think he wants to do it I don't think he wants to do anything he wants to do the challenge he thinks it's fun and funny but he just wants it to be funny so we're like okay we put in League cuz like he's played 15 hours I've never played is likew we just started putting in games we just started putting in games that we don't know how to play and last night we did about I think we did 10 runs and we did not get past game three and that was a run watching you play league it was crazy warmed my heart I've never played ever and it looked like that and San was like not bad for your first time no he just didn't want you to blow your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] off SM also you you actually encountered a cheater in Halo which was crazy oh he was flying around his name was like flying [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] shot and they killed him once and then he just literally started infinite or Master Chief Collection MCC yeah I ran into a guy that just became a robot like the little head oh like he changed his model yet to some like item that's in the game that you can't kill and so just it just slowly flies and then beams you and then slowly flies away and it's like this is we were playing a normal game of Halo one of the guys on the other team just leaves and then the guy who who didn't leave goes AFK for a couple minutes and we're like okay free dub and then he starts flying around and only hitting head shot character and we're like okay this round does count dud so he only treats when the guy on his team AFK is I guess is that ethical no of course not I don't know so it's more ethical than just normal treat and Alex doesn't like like restarting the like if you lose a game he doesn't like just saying hey let's just start with this one so we don't have to like close out the client and everything he we came up with the idea to spin a wheel to decide what game we play next yeah I I saw that and he wants to spin the wheel every time no matter what we do a horrible idea and he and no matter what he closes his game out so he so this happened like four times he closed the game out spun the same game then had to reopen the same game I could tell this happened because Nick does the little prodding things he's like yeah I'm going to keep Halo open just in case it hit Halo again cuz that dud and then and then it'll happen it'll be like oh yeah Clos this is what okay I actually had a flashback this is what happened so we when we did the session one I was I was clearly about to crash out I was minutes from crashing out I was like I'm like Alex I need cuz dude we got we played a Cod game where I had like 36 kills and he was in his settings the entire game because he just didn't set Cod up before we started the stream even though I even though i' said set everything up before the stream he said yeah I did so so we start the stream and whenever I say why didn't you set it up he goes bro I'm busy he said I don't like sitting on my computer all day I like walking around outside like that's crazy so I respect that cuz it's really important to walk it's but it's also F and sometimes you bump in your neighbors and take you look also I also walked that day I I I asked him so I was like okay I was getting really mad like in my head but I was like you know still playing cuz I'm like I want to win I'm like I would love to like try to do well in the challenge and I thought I remember I went back I was like ah you you laugh you lose I took it so seriously I wanted to win and while my friends hated me for it they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] never and they never forgot it and I was like I need to lighten up I fun so then I I texted him the next day and I was like Hey next time we do the challenge or well he was like hey we should change some of the games and I was like sure I'm down uh I was like yeah next time I do the challenge let's just try to make it really funny I don't really care if we wion and I was like I'm not I'm not going to care about the performance of it anymore I'm going to try to make it more funny and the second stream was a lot funnier yeah horrible you're still te God you just got to look at chat like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] am I doing there you're pissing me off yeah I don't read chat man read the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] chat cuzz your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] friends are there saying [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] funny [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I read a lot more the second time uh I liked there was a there was a spot during the first stream where Nick had like clicked into Halo incorrectly so it's a black screen play a game he played like a whole game of Halo with just a black screen on OBS and I'm in the chat like watching in the other room in our house and and we're and I'm just talking with the chat about like isn't this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ASMR so nice roasting and then he turned it back on and then everybody was like oh I need my I need my ambiance dude I I had a flashback moment because Nick Nick can't talk to you and drive a consistent speed my God I remember that at the same time he just goes faster and I think he genuinely has an inability to multitask this is made up all of this made up you did this the other day the other day when we went to when you're thinking about your point your foot just gets heavier yeah it's weird you you drive it home and cuz there's a button that does it for you yeah there is you just push a button you you don't going to worry anymore or or he goes way too I know what else all I'm saying is if you train yourself to look at chat and frag you also might be a safer driver oh okay that makes sense no I think it's like a like a condition can't do it's just a thing he'll never ever get better at 23 and me might be able to find that out for you spit in a can spit come in in come in come in actually just just make use the funnel use the paper get the I was like hella supported when you did the CH speaking of okay you you did it we I edged my seat we're all watching we're all happy for you anything okay how does that feel you said we're all watching how does that feel to bring up something you did and everyone's like oh you did it wrong the 50k people that were watching what hour was it it was like hour 100,000 you got like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] chime in and like I didn't he said we were all watch so you're right so I figured i' clarify that I was you're in a group and someone's like man I really want to kill myself and it's like we all love you you're like I don't love you like I don't love you like I like you I like you for sure I wouldn't say I love you and I want to make sure I tell you that right now I only love a few people it's just like I'm pickier with love that means a lot to me it just wasn't here I I just wasn't a good way to spend my time to watch it wasn't noted sure no no it was it was losing toishi that that was a better use of your time it you know what it was it was it shaped my confidence for the future that I was that I was at [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] two hits away from B richy at the nightclub no that's cool I'm proud of you so so I so what so what so so you get to the last game with Connor uh eats eats Japanese food and conat Sushi yeah you like that bad when I'm when I'm you with Japanese and con gash oh now I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] good like this of Miss a lot heavier I was talking yeah uh sorry I got to be I got to do a meeting I'll be back in 2 minutes where the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are going house we we literally have one time a week where we do we doing two minutes you know what I think we got this one boys two minutes you know what he's probably going to do you can't do anything in 2 minutes well I can tell you it takes zero minutes is eating a cold Factor but if you want to heat it up it'll take you 2 minutes and that's what he's probably going to do right now he's going to have a nutritious Chef prepared meal and he's going to eat it put it in the microwave kind of a waste of time in my opinion but you're still able to do that and he's probably going to go with the Protein Plus cuz he's been looking kind of thin right [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] serious would you kiss me on the mouth I would kiss you right on the mouth dude but I would do so before and after having one of 35 different meal choices do you understand me I look man I like the Protein Plus cuz I'm trying to get big again I hadn't got a gym for a month I have a genetic variant that gives me more muscle mass oh my God it's true it's true so Protein Plus comes in handy for me when I eat that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cold as the God's day it came on this Earth You you build that body with the premium ingredients they got that's what I'm saying you're eating filet Min that protein F body I get you can get the the the optimal like premium stuff and still eat it cold and that's the cool part so if you want to be like me or you want to be like Nick both are acceptable both are fine one of us has a genetic VAR the heaters and the freezers heaters in the freezers you go to factor meals.com theard 50 use code the yard 50 get 50% off plus 20% off the next box in your subscription yeah that's code the yard 50 at Factor meals.com theard 50 and 50% off your box and 20% off the next box and that's pretty cool so when you use America's number one redit eat meal kit you can do it like me or you can do it like Nick but either way you can kiss me on the mouth you can kiss Aiden on the and now the worst co-host will be back we we need have at some point Conor pants in this pod we have flamed on the Reddit we did get flamed on the Reddit for not having a you know what he's never asked me there was insane he to be clear I think it's why we haven't had him is because the amount of times he has asked I told him he has to do our idea I want to put him inside of a cage and I want to oil him up and I want him to be in there the whole episode we want you like mang you have 90 minutes to to get oiled up enough to squeeze through the bar the only way he can get in and out on our podcast it's just Conor with oil on uh so the final game was fortnite yes and it gets like to like last like six people alive there was like eight people and uh Conor dog VA DCS yeah and you phoned it in which I thought was kind of cringe because it came down to a 1V one lwi versus Dr Doom in fortnite and this would have been it and lwi just kind of threw didn't play the 1 V one even though would have been hard and then he's like that doesn't count you DC we'll run it again which I think is fine uh but but I was arguing with lwig and then after that they they beat it they it was like a bot lobby and it was like kind of anticlimactic but they just cleaned it up but I would argue that lwig one V oneing Dr Doom after Sea Dog dies is way more hype cuz someone's got to be shake and someone's got to be baked no cuz that's what we learned is at first it felt like someone had to be shake and someone had to be bake but then we learned that actually our love right as lovers right was the force that was able to help us win it well it's always the force the force is there for the whole time but when he was not in the lobby also you need you needed Conor's ELO to get the Bots back in the lobby thank you cuz when he DC all the Bots were placed with players dropped in and I was like he's moving a little fast for me uh I thought that would have been insane it's like Conor he get shot up stream viewers perspective that's better but from a from a Connor perspective that's that's not very fun he's just like tabed out that's life bro yeah but why that's like being that's if the cuck chair was in the other room and you didn't even get to watch it's like you're not even the cuck anymore it's called lowers a world I feel like it was like the final curveball of of the world being like ah even though you're playing great we're going to throw Tech issue at you and now you have to overcome that by like pretty much having a guaranteed win get taken away and to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] run it back you know and maybe the second game wasn't as hype like but if it was more hype I think you wouldn't think the way you think no I still I think even if the final game was hype and it wasn't filled with literal actual Bots like there there red pandas I think it would have been more I thought about this lot I had the same exact thought you had and then I thought about like well maybe it's a worse video If only one of them's at the finish line and so I was like okay well then what I think he should have done I think the second HEC you should have left and been like oh I'm not doing it without you I'm not doing it without you yeah alt4 that doesn't count alt f4 cuz I think I think even though you said it before it happened which which clarified your intentions I think going and then getting to the last guy then dying to him and then saying that one doesn't count you said it first though makes it a little weird cuz it's like I that's fair would you count if you won it was a Dr Doom 1 V one like it's it's pretty impossible bro to me it was like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it was like it was like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hope core guy breaks leg during race father comes to help him finish like that's what it was and so I'm happy yeah I felt great bro and you guys got one more in there right you got 21 we got 21 that was Beast yeah I like that Garfield racing was trolling bro that game was so hard yeah oh my God I never knew Garfield cart Garfield cart dude didn't they play that at the world's greatest no we played some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ass Lego 2K RAC racer right because they were like some partner with YouTube and YouTube's like you got to play this and we're like w we really don't want to void did you see my rocket League game with Alex I did not did you crush so our elos very different so when we play we have very very bad players in the lobby and I just try to set him up for shots yeah so I like dribble the ball I'm like all right Alex drive down mid and there's a there's a clip where I drive the ball right in front of the goal it's on the line and it's just sitting there bouncing and he drives up and just flips under the ball and completely misses it bro rocket league is such an incredibly difficult game to like it's like Melee I feel like you need so many hours just get a control of your car is it I've never played hard yeah yeah you like everyone can drive on the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ground but like everyone just ends up like a dog chasing the ball I think I think it's rocket league is particularly hard if you never go in the range if you go in the range just like three times you go up two ranks yeah immediately it's like ridiculous most people don't go most people just don't go in the range and like oh this is kind of how the the rockets work this is how the jumping works okay okay now I'm going to play they just raw run at the ball cuz it's fun to run at ball and they you it's it's really hard to learn that way cuz you usually fail is rocket League fun yeah it's really fun horr fun why don't you guys play it to this day I still play it he was a grinder of it I it's fun until you play people who are very good and then you're like H I have to learn and go to the range when you're getting gapped in that game it you can't you can't even touch the ball it's actually very frustrating and I think the range is not fun getting better at the game I don't enjoy I played a lot two years ago cuz I wanted to hit champ and I hit champ champ uh it goes champ you didn't hit champ there's a picture of it BL says you didn't hit it okay BL said there's a picture I saw AI picture of Donald Trump jerking off a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dog to that was that was an AI that was real that happened at the white house uh they come tremendously go up to the top was not Donald I don't know man I don't care champ is The champ is the purple one on the right side okay so it's uh champ 123 and then it's Grand champ and then suic legic Legend they have the coolest like final rankic Legend it's better than like Challenger like radiant it's like yeah I'm a super sonic Legend I'm I'm from I think I've said this before maybe on the show but the rocket League's weird CU I actually think that every everyone can get to Champ without doing Aerials I don't think you need to be able to do Aerials which is like the kind of the I think maybe diamond is true dude I'm bad at Aerials man I'm not saying you're good like I I think I think I think if you can dribble the ball and you kind of like you you rotate you're you just can win that Gustavo what's the highest you you've ever been in a game huh what's the highest you've ever been in a game ranked ranked ranked don't be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] making some joke about gummies bro okay pissing me off inv valer no no no no wait you no oh my God you haven't hit Diamond one my my it's the highest he's hit is p three dude what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] my highest a team my highest ever rank A new mouse pad or something I Legends in 3 months oh my God I saw there was math on your subreddit they said you cannot do this yeah they said I can't do a lot I can't hit 1 th000 threes I can't do the lovers versus World Challenge I got a lot of haters the bet is plat right plat but the okay sometimes most of the time the people are wrong cuz they're idiots but this time they were counting hours it would take and hours are the one thing lwig that you have the most problem surrendering okay and what was bad about their math it was just like I I think it's like a certain amount of hours a day that I know you can't commit that they use a static number for LP and they base everything off of that that's average is that's fine law of averages you guys really think my Lu was that bad it's not brother yeah it's not based off of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] my LP gains it's just based off an arbitrary number you threw okay so you think you can do it yeah cuz my LP gains are way higher than that if I win a game I get like 35 [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 40 LP like I I climb I got you seen that screen often 75% of the time you're not you're not going to get that much as you go up huh you're not going to get that much LP as you go up it I think I will it level off eventually might youa have a hidden MMR the game's probably trying to pull you towards what it thinks your true skill is and then you'll it'll Plateau it might plat a bit or it doesn't or it doesn't cuz my skill is Diamond uh no I think I think I think I'll hit it okay I mean it's easy to say words are easy to say I bet on me I bet on me you kind of I thought my Lux played all right I'm not kidding brother I your Lux is not playing all right I didn't see it I hit a couple SS okay Lux all no that's it's good heit it he it's good you would you would want it it'd be it be they didn't usually die dude it'd be aight so embarrassing to Miss Lu it's a straight line I missed it more than I hit it actually that's that's right it was confusing CU I have to is it a skill shot I'm really bad I'm really technically yeah a skill shot that keys on my keyboard are until I look down yeah if you don't play the game it's the giant beam of light that goes straight like a kameha Mayo you know what there's kind of a delay delay in it they move and so but you know you could anticipate where they it's fine you know it's fine they're probably getting CC bu I also have to I have to look down at my keyboard to see where like R is that's that's crazy dude dude it I actually wanted to throw up he loads into his like the training mode of League which is actually very bad I don't think it teaches that's a stoned dead lie I don't think the the game teaches you that oh I maybe their walkthrough is bad but their actual like training like because you can the tutorial the tutorial I bet the to is and so so you you load you load it up and he's he's looking at qweer and he's looking at it like I can see the gears in his head's uncovered of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tomb scripts he's thinking like do I have to use these buttons he's trying to read the Dead Sea Scrolls like oh no it's exactly I was like can I put these on my mouse yeah like he which isn't like Legacy keys were in Dota for a long time they'd be all over the map because they were attached to like the letter and the word but uh that was funny also I told him in chat Mouse over the ability to learn what it does and he said oh that's so good no I said oh that's helpful that's helpful and I was like we're starting helpful day one I'm a baby I need to I need to be fed I need a diaper CH produced content for [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] DOTA Summits like you and the entire way I said I don't get it I'm watching I'm like I don't get it I can't see this it feels it feels like I'm blind to it help playing is helping now I'm like I kind of get it Z see if squeaks is live I've been rejoicing in their stream all day stands and squeaks just stuck on one what which one Fall Guys oh they just go live and they do a Fall Guys stream for eight hours me and Alex played fall guys off stream cuz we hadn't played like in a really long time and we won our second game he's on chess or they playing a bug snap what best right now they're at four yeah they're playing bug house I don't know why they're playing Bug House wait Gauntlet progression i 0 out of 10 0 out to 10 it says um this is oh yeah I thought this is really bad Nick reading the board State he's tapping his pieces to see the to see where they move yeah yeah well the Queen's in trouble so now he's going to win has this been good I haven't watched it there run good content I I I like it personally I just like but I me m and one it's got a haircut black has M and one wow um you shouldn't be getting haircuts should be trying to hang he has to drag his Bishop on when you're going bald getting a haircut is very scary cuz you're like is it going to come back I'm even lowkey scared of like shaving my head cuz I think it'd go back different but I don't know if that's real well that's what H green went through but he also had cancer yes if we put you through chemo yeah I'm asking him this exact question actually he has a show he has a show and it's like uh actually have any questions maybe it's not too late but he's like give me 10 topics that people wonder about and I will answer them all it can be poer I think I'll send I'll I'll share what I sent him you know what's funny I was worried about getting older uh in the past couple months and I've been thinking about it a lot I wanted to message Hank Green he's 10 years older than me and ask him for like his thoughts but he doesn't follow me so I can't and and I was too embarrassed to ask Ludwick to do that for me and green follows me that's crazy I the other week and he responded way I'll just bring it up doesn't follow me so me I'll bring it up I asked him about uh growing a company that he's the face of and if he ever wonders what would happen if he left the company oh that's a good question I curious about that I ask I'm asking him what did people do before we had credit scores and why does my taint hurt when I sneeze does it yeah why well no sorry that was a bad question you get a random sharp pain in your butth hole my I looked it up I looked it up the thing it's it's like normal it's not bad for you just happens dude sometimes I'd be walking home from work and I would just like that pain would come and I'm going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] my pants on this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] walk home this is it's over for me what what are you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] laughing about he said sometimes when I'm walking home from work at first and I was like from what did you just get a job and not tell us I had a moment where like are you like quietly working at bath worked at 9 to5 without telling any of us that'd be so Beast it would be really funny I thought about this cuz I've always wanted to get like a weekend job dealing poker but then I was like yeah comma poker that's a hilarious way to say that but I but I don't like the idea of just taking someone else's job who would might need those shifts arbitrarily yeah so that's like the mor I think in the current job market for at least those types of positions there's more available than people to take them right for poker dealing I don't know the I what's the landcape right but it's more like the idea of like I would only be doing it to pass time and do something fun instead of a wage maybe I give the wages to another guy we've been talking about making big changes to this to this podcast okay you know and often times when we do that we have to spend money to do so so I found some opportunities for us at discount from a different show that is auctioning off a lot of its valuables and IP Alex Jones is auctioning off everything Infowars owns to pay back the Sandy Hook victims and I was wondering how much does he own like dude like a billion dollars he doesn't have a billion he a lot of money but he has to liquidate like his entire give as much as he can give basically so you can buy wait is there a link you can buy stuff can you can you look up INF Wars auction an eye at autofills apparently like a rapper and it's like just dropped a rack and I'm like this and I'm just surrounded by his like tables and chairs and Road M moral Dilma I think you can even straight up buy I thought about this by the way you can straight up even buy like the Infowars IP in the auction cuz you are is a moral dilemma is aaly and make it like a micro penis Foundation but you are ultimately it's like at first glance I was like are you am I helping out Alex Jones but on second thought I'm like no it's kind of like I'm donating to the families of the S Hook victim because he he they receive the P because he doesn't have the money to pay them either way right that's why that's almost a net positive no that the people who are buying this stuff are going to be people who are consumers and fans of Infowars and that they're the ones who are losing the money we take it away from them like they because if you presumably if you win the bid on an item they're not losing the money and they I think maybe should cuz they're also like probably perpetuating a lot of the dumb [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he says it's like buying a big like an old school Nazi flag and then burning it like instead of the guys that would hanging up in their trailer to pass but they would hang up in their trailer that's what I'm saying what we would be doing is a good thing cuz we're taking it from the the weird I think it's a bad thing cuz the weirdos would have lost more money I don't think the weirdos should get to have the pallet of Alex Jones protein supplements I think that's I don't think they should I don't think cuz that's a win for them I forwe God he s like Doomsday [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] his body looked like a big is to the auction item apparently apparent when I found out about this like 5 days ago it hadn't started yet but I happening at some point it's just announced but probably not out but you know if we need any like resources well the yard live stream to raise money for Alex Jones will be coming to a twitch Channel near you we talked about the yard sale yes and now we have the yard purchase yard Wars yard Wars oh patreon exclusive show get political we get political we're get freaking hella political did you see the dangerously political did you see the post are subreddit from some guy some guy in Lebanon he's like come to Lebanon no he was well that was a different post which was crazy to read that after this first one the first one was I'm listening to the podcast right now while air strikes hit my city and he's like the air strikes are like hitting nearby outside and I have the pod on right now this is so surreal like 5 days later someone else from Lebanon post and is like they should come visit Beirut like unironically and I was I read that post and then I was you know I was thinking about saying like I don't know if like we'd come right now but the top comment was already a third listener from Lebanon who said it's a bad time like let me just beat you guys to it like that's great we have so many a bad time Lebanon Lebanese listeners that's cool look as a new as a newly minted member of the Balan Peninsula which is close enough it's so far it's close it's close enough close between them oh I'm sorry this well France is farther away and an it's kind of like you draw a triangle between and a turkey they're not equidistant but what I'm saying is look I'd love to go maybe when things simber down a little bit we actually genuinely hope you're all safe 100% it's safe can Vis if you're in any area that is experiencing War conflict and kinetic strikes I hope you're okay I think that's but when we change inow Wars branding we I won't let say that anymore it's going to be all different but understand we still feel it even though we don't say it buy that IP we are coming to people for the first episode of the D and D show and the and the desk is just the Alex Jones Infowars desk we play D and D on that this person says I got scared that the last joke I would ever hear was Ludwick talking about jerking people's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with Mickey Mouse clubs wow luckily I'm safe now thank God but yeah Jesus Christ man it was just funny that this one came after that first one we should send like I don't know something to something to him Christmas me I went to New York and uh I I went I went to nightclub I went to go play melee met a bunch of people there very nice night scene one fan came up to me at the end of the night and he said I love the girls night shirt it's awesome I've been wearing it out to bars and last week I wore it to some random bar in New York and four different people asked me about it and bought the shirt like four non Yardigans saw him wearing the shirt at the bar and then ordered the pre-order shirt with you smoking crack on the the idea of a guy being like I have this funny shirt of a guy smoking crack this is girls night they don't know who you are that's that just means it's good AAR that warms my heart that's like what skateboarding clothes are you got to give 10% like they need a that's a commiss I don't even have one I need to ask can you get me yeah get you one I have one it's tight I I I will say there a lot of things in this life pass through me as a feeling accomplished but me smoking a crack pipe on a shirt and people going that's hype that makes me feel pretty good it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hyp and r games didn't want that in look got us look where it's got us We snuck at pissing me off bro uh oh yeah also did Mike tell you this and this will remain anonymous for them uh of course but someone through the customer support wanted to change their girls night t-shirt order to a larger size because they're pregnant and they said they want to be wearing it while giving birth oh no we should have [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] beautiful we should have said no to that no you say beautiful what do you mean it is girls that is the girls night also what what maybe you're not considering it what if it's a crack baby that's part of their culture I or if it's a girl being born I was thinking more the opposite where like the doctor sees this and just pulls the baby into the nicku for like I I actually have a better idea we make a Babys sized version of the girl girls night onesie we make an exclusive one for the baby look right into the yard Discord if you have a baby and we'll make him a shirt a Shir can you even print on a shirt that small it is possible yes lwi you think that they wear you think they don't wear clothes with print on them what about those Disney it says like daddy's little goofy or I thought they could only wear onesies I can't believe you're my boss diaper of Terror just oh you're freaking baby expert cuz you drink baby breast milk one time so know more I know more I've seen tasted more baby it's got Umami said dude yeah so good good days you saw iron Mouse break record yeah it sucks that it's all going to a CTO SC the all time yes I don't know what he's referencing it is going to is it not a crypto SC all time what iron Mouse I oh no iron Mouse is a sentient nft and right like that's why world's first AI nft crypto that's why she's like a vtuber cuz there's no like traceable like a whole thing yeah you can't it's not it's technically going not going to an address save Twitter and comedy it's just going iron coin uh no it's going to the IDF no that's right yeah oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and then she said to be clear oh it's different IDF forgot that wasn't Jon Mouse Defense Force uh yeah that's she crushed she got so many Subs what turn out to be great too what I what I'm curious about was the twitch thing where they're matching s was that part of the number or is that relevant to the number it's part of it yeah they just gift it like instantly oh so like if you gift I don't know how it works but like I've seen someone get like five gifted subs and then twitch gifted 26 is this like a roll or something it is a like it's a random it's a like part of the end of September for the final few days for gifted twitch is just matching in a random amount for any gifts over five that's so interesting wait so but matching a random amount as in it could be more you could give five and then it you said said I saw someone get five gifted and then twitch gave 26 that's from like an automated I think it's usually 20% I'm pretty sure for them I think it just increases the total amount of subs and for subtember which is like but they're just losing money uh yeah they are right cuz I think we we as if you're a streamer you're gifting and you're losing money but it's done as a marketing spend to the good faith and the Good Will of the community that you fostered on the website that's just don't seem lose money or break even I'm not exactly sure how they they've set it up I don't think it loses too much and I think you know it's good because like it it has made the I guess if one streamer gets 26 another one gets like one oh so they'll definitely get one and like it also made you know the most sub streamer of all time like they got that through this and quite a few people over no shade I mean no shade at all is it a little Mickey Mouse because of like the twitch matching at all is as Mickey Mouse as Ninja's record because he did it through primes or mine cuz I did it through a subathon when you know wait is came out I feel like yours and Kai's weren't though right I saying it's all Mickey Mouse right like I mean take from curi record yeah wasn't his because of like a fortnite in-game thing though yeah but you got twitch Primes so you he had to like but like so there there's always going to be some sort of like I see there's always some sort of mechanism that's helping it along and like this one you know someone could not replicate next month but that's just like whatever the problem is here and I you know Iron Mouse seems like a great person or persons you know what I'm saying like Shakespeare a vtuber subathon is like Shakespeare all right I got a call I said hey they say hey you want to be my mouse for like a day or two yeah while she rests I was like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it let's go I'm breaking this news right here in the yard podcast I'm saying that a vtuber subathon is more mysterious and maybe the crypto scam should go to me as well I don't what what do he think there's a crypto he's just saying he wants money I lost him like Words wants money I think you just want money he wants a lot of he wants a lot of money I think I would like some of I would like be broken off some of the iron Mouse I was the ID all along give me my money that's cool it's a lot of it's a lot of damn Subs it is a lot of damn Subs [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy someone's going to hit a million Subs one day and they're going to live probably in like Spain or not in the US it's way possible yeah I'm surprised that hasn't happened yet actually with the Spanish streamer well maybe just a non-english speaking country CU Subs are so much cheaper I feel like the Spanish streamers have have felled off where are all the big uh Indian streamers where where are they uh I don't think they're on Twitch they not on YouTube uh I think YouTube's a pretty popular site I don't know if there's a an like a native site to India t- series playing fortnite but YouTube's big you that the biggest ever live stream ever of all time ever is like an Indian news station really what was the like a single broadcast coverage of the election uh American election no the Indian Sayan number one what's going on with this Trump guy no I I forget how many views man maybe 8 million that's how much the uh the Red Bull like Stratosphere skydiving thing was dude that had the record for so long and that was like before live streaming was a big deal yeah that was tight bro D before I got off stream last night I was like I should raid someone and uh I had like 700 viewers or something like that and I was like I was looking at my people I'm following and gifted hater was online I was like oh I'll raid gifted hater I didn't even look what he was doing I was just I just raided him and then I raided him then I went and looked what he was doing and a bunch of his friends were in a dark room with like those lights that put pictures on the wall like almost like the stars but it was like FL stuff you'd see in like a karaoke room they're singing karaoke uh one of the tabs on their Google Chrome says how tall is lwig no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] way and which was C The Coincidence insane but they're doing they're doing like Jamaican Renditions of like post hardcore music and like like

goat versus Zayn show match yeah I missed all this I didn't even know this is happening yeah Zay Zay beat mango 100 well he wasn't trying it was at a tournament it was like a popup tournament up thing and it's like there was like an like Toronto bracket he said no no in no why why are you trying to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] leave Zayn out high and dry you no I'm not I'm telling you what what it is I think it should count so then count it that's not how it works why are you spitting on me because he's my player and you're screwing him SC I'm not doing I invited him to my tournament which he refused to go to that is crazy can we we should put try to get Aiden on Haw Tua or talk he would have a you guys have to understand T Tua is number three she's big in the world we were like number nine when we started no we were like number [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 17 in comedy podcast in America four guys we like we Peak top 20 when we started eat my dick hole top 20 so far from [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dick hole it's so far from I think it was 13 exactly so far from top 10 he said eat your so far that's so far from top 10 americ number one away that's that's far it's as far as she is from one when talk Tua falls down in the ranks maybe she'll they'll start you know Fielding calls from shows like us we get it's not going to fall down the ranks bro can you go on you could you get talk to it easily he's right right now KY Welch doesn't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with lwi right now you think that we could get her on to like like blue sky or like threads we get her off x no she getting paid [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Millions for X you seen you seen Connor use your shred yeah dude I'm going to be I I kind of maybe I'm crazy too far you can't dude I do not think you can rip it and bring up the the post I will say Connor e spants is going down a dangerous line recently he had some critical Acclaim for his stream with the Exotic Tiger King yes yeah from his jail cell from his jail cell dude he actually did and and and now he has locked a fortnite Friday with George Santos George Santos [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what George Santos repli Congressman George S fat gay Congressman Republic Congressman I only hate him for one of those and uh and he's going to have him on and and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy and now he has somehow managed Haley Welsh Hawk to a girl to to reply to his DMS presumably to also go because he said he was going to crash into the median yeah I think he this is a this is a foolproof strategy i i i this is the this is the me three-step plan to get anyone to reply to you it's on the subreddit it just say like the Nick method worked or something you also just go to Connor's pants's Twitter and go to replies it's like recent but so he's going big he's going big I'm a little worried about his guests like I feel like if he could get Alex Jones he would I feel like if Hill is around he might be tweeting at him well is it not is he not just becoming like the new Rogan dude it'd be so if there was like a no if listen I want him to go full Tucker Carlson and go to Russia to interview Putin he's not okay so Haley Welch tweeted something uh thanks SNL but please don't edit my charity pause Across America she does love uh dogs and such and then Connor replied Haley if you don't respond to my direct message I'm going to crash my vehicle into the highway median ratios her six times 6X haey Welch on X says Conor I don't look at DMS usually but I will and then it so basically that's Conor quote tweets it and he's just like take notes y'all so I'm sorry Jesus yeah uh no this is awesome this is It's the planet work this how you get people's attention I think the difference between Connor if he keeps getting these guests and Joe Rogan is one simple man Jamie he has no Jamie yeah I think Jamie actually adds so much to Joe Rogan because if imagine if he wasn't there because because who P pulls it up no one if no one pulls it up it's it's just Joe making [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up without doar I feel like Connor inviting you to fortnite Fridays is like Eric Andre inviting you to the Eric Andre show it's like like the Tiger King rage quit the interview yeah that's true yeah it's awesome you have to like you're consenting softly to some sort of wacky experience that you might not end up liking yeah Connor cuz Connor didn't look up anything he just kind of vaguely knew that he was in jail and I think watched the Tiger King documentary four years ago and so he was like he was just saying [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and and then and Joe Exotic you know regardless right wrong he's like you don't even know what you're talking about he's like yeah I don't I don't I don't know what I'm talking about I lie I'm just playing fortnite 99 bro it's cool uh so we'll see we'll see the George Santos one should be something maybe maybe the yard with Connor should be in fortnite should be live from fortnite like from tiled Towers or something you know like their their avatars we avatars and Connor's there and the whole episode's in fortnite dude they're all and it's like people are sitting in like chairs in fortnite we we can have someone build the art in fortnite they have the tools and they're like it's like the Travis scottc they're like kaijus one of us is Peter Griffin they're gigantic and they're knocking down tilted I've had to play fortnite for the challenge there's some IP in that game that is crazy dude it's so good I it looks like Netflix in there such a good game bro you think so it's so good dude if you're I feel like if you're a kid it's like a dream game because there's not just fortnite bro it's like there's fortnite there's all the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] custom games now like D I got in and there's like dude there's straight up like there was a thing called like fort night like like Fort and the night like a night and it wasek like a total reskin it a totally different game it looked like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Elden ring yeah they had like the Lego call out they're they're very good at keeping the treadmill going of like oh that's cool Dr Doom's in this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] now bro I heard some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about fortnite what are you talking about dude so they started paying out map creators okay and it's like a big thing they were doing to basically compete with Roblox because they want kids to be on fortnite but not just playing the Battle Royale playing they want them to be slaves yes make they make our make our exct make the games for us make the games for us SL but then they pay if people are using your map if your concurrent player base because you're basically making you know kind of a game in a way uh and they paid a lot but what they messed up is that there was already maps that were Mega popular and had a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ton of players like one V one Maps where people would practice but they didn't count build battles and no they did count them but the same as someone making a new map you know for like hide and seek or whatever that bad cuz they ended up paying out like tens of millions of dollars to these map creators that had already made it yeah that people were already on that weren't bringing more value that weren't bringing more value but you still get them theirs right which is kind of cool I mean it's sick for them you're paying you're paying retrospectively it's just an insanely retroactively like they weren't doing that to be nice they just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up that's funny well I don't think they have a choice cuz if they did that and then they they just pay out new users yeah but if they did a new well maybe yeah that's it that's literally and that's what they switched it to ah okay so they just they they were like they were like ah yeah we're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out 50 mil uh we should probably switch it they'll you know what they'll be all right epic they'll be all all right but it's crazy hundreds of millions a month I love the idea at PE they were making 300 million a month PE they were it was an announced number SM [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dick and I don't know if they're making 300 million a month anymore someone get the sliding thing pick up the everywhere now we can look this up well I think that underlock they were making $300 million a month at one point yeah but if you're quoting like numbers if that's true what he just said then what he said is not crazy day do you think [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you you're say so you're saying's going mode so you're saying they never had that much money a month on hey oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bro I cracked Kelby this weekend oh my god I've never seen him so mad you took him out of the you rip up a $100 bill in front of him what do you do okay let's go dude no you want to see Kelby get mad this company it gives you wings and that's why it tastes so damn good Archie man I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with you heav bro he's not sponsored denounce it if you're if you love it so much he won't he won't say anything I I well I don't want any of this in all right what well we can bleep we bleep over it so uh Archie take the SK the the smoldering remains of this bit do the do the robot gives you wigs over I love that every time um no man we just hung out like 24 hours and there's the like Sunday yesterday was like the long you know show day and it lasted like 10 hours and so Kell just by the end of it was really tired but I was hanging out with him all weekend I'm just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm doing this every five you're a fun guy to travel with I'm doing I know I know I looked I looked too I'm doing it every five I'm getting them I'm doing it to me at twitchcon I'm doing it to him in ways that he's like never seen that's like it's for me it's standard but like I'm dropping [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and like he goes to pick it up and I have it there he's like wait you didn't plan to drop that and then by the end of the day I look at him and he just looks really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like like like he just looks fed up like Shell Shocked yeah like I I I was just on the couch but he just he was just like he was like and then and then I'm hitting with it and I'm like I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] around still and in the Uber I can just see the hairs on his neck going up and and and after we were like going to go to the hotel where and had some like rooftop food Afterparty that red wolv was putting on and we were like yeah let's all meet up there and K's like yeah I'll meet you guys there never showed up oh never showed up didn't get food I don't know what he ate I think he like ordered McDonald's are you saying you drove him to the break of insanity I think me in conjunction with the longer day yeah took him out yeah he's not built for that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he's not built for that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bro I I I and then I also was at at the Afterparty tens is kind of like a he drinks like a young man like a lot just an infinite amount of shots he is a young man yes you know you know drinks like one too you know who commands Mango's respect is tens his drinking love they mango [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with tenens heavily because he's like I got Hammer with that guy once ten loves getting [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up and he loves ripping shots Beyond his limit it's not like he's like oh yeah I know how many shots I can take it's like oh yeah shot time um yeah sure and he'll like do a little and it it was just this horrible well tequila and they and they served him in these glasses that were like little vases that were two shots and I was like I was like you guys are pouring heavy and the guy was like yeah and I was like I don't like like and I know my limit cuz I think I got a stomach ulcer from drinking this past week okay uh that's scary and you pooped blood a little bit no okay but I just was bloated all like like 48 hours after and just had stomach pain uh and so I was like I don't want to drink a lot but they kept ripping shots and so so I was I started cheesing I started cheating oh yeah you want these I I was literally doing I was doing the eat the lime throw it in the back eat the lime way and I was and I was doing it I was getting away with it cuz big group shots you got to do that what's the last time you did this was it with mango or something you you've talked about faking the funk before like this which I respect because it's like you're just trying to keep the Vibes going I'm faking the funk I'm handing off shots when I can right I'm doing all this at one point though this is one I felt bad is me and T were doing a shot just us together and it's and it's that and I go and I do the and I try to pour it and he goes you're pouring that he he clocked you yeah cuz I I was just I was like I had the big glass I was trying to remove of it and I was just going I was just going talking to him I was just jerking my hand to just get rid of like half the glass and he's like and he like grabbed my hand he's like no you have to take it and so then when I eat the lime I did a slide behind the back I got rid of it and I did it and I got away with it and I felt so bad he was like that's so true what what what was that that was supposed to be DK dude my D's good it's the only line oh dude that was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up cuz you hate Turks I do hate that's why I'm mocking came from came from a bad place it's an evil place it's no it's like Archie's impression of Andrew Tate is one thing and it's if you're not fat it's the only thing he can say but he says it really well wait so did the venue floor just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] was it just sticky oh yeah man I was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I I threw in a plant I threw in a plant oh you're outside but no no they just said like a like a fake indoor plant oh good so it couldn't die over the nighty fake indoor plant now someone puts his cigarette out on it the whole building goes up that was the trip did did the Moyers win I didn't watch no we lost we lost but it was so we didn't we we weren't ever going to win okay like we didn't practice for this event our team is in shambles disarray moist Shopify is is is Rip at least the team that existed because of the season and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we just have really talented players who have all or many uh have gotten offers from tier one teams and so they're just going mines are just elsewhere huh just elsewhere made farm team no they're already like doing that like the our season ended oh okay so we weren't like come back you really have to practice for this qualifier for an event that'll happen after you're gone yeah uh for a different team to win at at that point it's just good like tournament practice this was literally just a last harra sure do you have a farm team uh do you know what that is yeah our team is in a roundabout way a farm team but only if we don't promote that's how it becomes a farm team if if you had won the tournament then it wouldn't be a farm team but farm team it's like you you cultivate good Play It's like a team it's a team you own or keep to like develop talent to come up how mod League Baseball works it's how League Academy worked uh and I guess still works to some degree it's used it in a pejorative a lot of the time it's like oh that's just a farm team there's no the difference between like Farm teams and like us is there isn't a there is a way to promote yeah yeah yeah and the wild west world of far team has like no reason to have like a dedicated fan base right it's so wishy-washy and like players are constantly leaving he to be pretty die hard about a sport to like follow you only be usually Farm teams are connected to a major league team so you're a fan of your major League's farm team oh yeah you know when Michael Jordan went to play baseball he played on the White Sox farm team oh this is all explained in Moneyball so you should you're watch all Moneyball in on YouTube didn't sck apparently you missed the farm team SE farm team C doesn't come up that clip doesn't come up come up I don't like looking at Jah Hill that long yeah that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up crucial crucial criticism uh dude we did this cold ones shoot what happened dud it might be the single worst video if they upload it to ever come out really the office was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up there was like food everywhere like like crumbs of food on table dude wobby like stole [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah he did apparently cuz I I but like okay so here's what happened the shoot wobby took postcards wubby took our yard postcard some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we make up when we don't send them dude W wub took post actually did actually did dog ate the other halfing out cuz WBY took all the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] St [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] too uh so the the I got a message from Max that was like uh bar speedrun and I cuz I think he saw that I did it with seog and Alex and uh the fourth person who I love dearly that's crazy I don't remember but it's not my job to do so Doug Doug Doug Doug poor Doug Doug Doug Doug Doug Jes that guy's real skill that's one or two guys Doug did some funny [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he said he said uh hey we're doing a meet up here and then dropped a uh XY like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] coordinate and was the top of a mountain in New Zealand and then he said meet up in 1 hour and then in an hour it was just when he was his hike was done he was like here but one person replied to that little joke and they're like we're on the way please wait we've been hiking that's I didn't click on that cuz I was like Doug Doug's a coder this might be a a computer worm you you thought he was trying to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] get the I didn't want the smoke but I did know there was some joke Brewing uh so anyway I thought it was the bar speedrun and I was like what we doing he's and then Max says don't ask me your company's doing it and so then I didn't even know about that offbrand was like shooting I came in and it was Andrew and Ryan outfitting a van yes with cameras and I'm like that be beast and I asked them and they're like oh our job is just to film and get you know permission from the bars they're doing the creative and so I'm like What's the creative to them and they're like ah you know we'll just have drinks and we'll come together and and so all we do is we go to a bar we get alcohol which is like a shot in some drink beast and then we go to another bar oh and another bar you drink it again and we do it like eight times are you cracking jokes and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we're cracking jokes and you're drunk as all piss we're drunk as all piss everyone threw up SS and wubby threw up by bar four yeah you're describing this like it's not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cool I I it sounds funny I don't I don't know how it is cohesive at all it's just The Narrative of getting drunk progress through the night it's just eight bars I will tell you Chad I asked him I was like what's the thing you're the most proud of these days that you're putting out well when we were there in Australia and he said we did like a pub uh like a bar thing in some remote Town yeah and he he loved that he was like that's my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I think it was a great produced video and it's like the concept I want to be doing which is drinking which is kind of funny and I was like oh oh that's sick so it sounds like this is an extension of what fulfills him but you're meeting this with criticism about the video is I don't alol just became a YouTuber so we got to kind of be supportive now it I guess the issue is like there was cameras and they were following people but like so we're in round one and we're supposed to do like some arcade game and then like the winner gets losers and force them to drink something Max and Michael just left and then went to the bar and got shots off cam okay like this this type of thing would happened where it was like it was like director who directed There was supposed to be Darcy who's like like on their team oh that guy but it was too hard I think for him to just Wrangle the drunk people cuz they would just wander off like wiy the Poo to go drink some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] honey oh my God Acoustics and then the final bar we got so H cuz we go to this bar round one and the guy there recognizes the cold on guys and he sounds like a surf dude he's like guys what's up dude you guys are I freaking hear that's crazy do you want the Jimmy slimmy what's that what Jimmy s that's what we wondered yeah cuz You' wonder what what that is cuz he said that's that's what we ate at the sucking fuckathon and and so then and so we go yeah could we have the Jimmy slimy he's like dude yeah right away and while he's doing that he looks some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up on his phone and then props it up and I see this I'm like that's weird but maybe he doesn't know how to make it off top and then he starts pouring some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] together it's a blue drink he hands it to Michael Michael takes a sip and he says this is the worst thing I've ever had never make this again to the guy's face before Michael gets sentence out as he's sipping the guy goes do I'm going to make four more dude that's crazy and and I and I had everyone try it's the it was the it was the most disgusting thing I ever had when I got back I think just off that one sip I threw up so much in this warehous zipper zipper Jimmy slimmie ingredients you look slim CTA I don't think it's real so he look up on his phone I don't know cuz when we asked him later what was in it he said I don't know I just put a bunch of stuff together he was just watching the video of that like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] machine putting it under the liquid while he just put [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] together it was it didn't matter what was on his his his camera whatever he feels so I I threw up so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] much and then wubby was like can I have this so that's when he stole it you said yes well he had a pack of Red Bulls he's like he's like I'm taking this I said okay yeah I'm on the ground I'm lying down and he's just walking by zipper zipper just said this is not a thing dude you got you got secret weapons Jamie Jamie would be able to pull this up I felt so bad I had seven cigarettes really yeah oh that's seven New Year's with slime yeah in one night Jesus you went on a bit of a bender this week and that same day I also did a shoot with the last meal people uh mythical kitchen you get you eat your last meal so oh they make you whatever you want yeah so it's like 10 courses that's awesome it's

ruined your last meal for yourself it taste gross now hours after no I don't think drink in the morning no no no the shoot for the last meal was like 2 to 6 and then the drinking was six to like mid it all happen in one day which are two things you don't want to have happen the same day so if you were shooting a video about both of those things that would be a good video I ate a ridiculous amount of food then I drink a ridiculous Al 4,000 calories then drank 4,000 calories yeah I think I gain eight PBS at day I like that I like you're putting your body to the test cuz that's what I try to do nightly when Phelps does it and look at him he's a he's a good swimmer he's a genetic I do burn it off like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mad man on my pelaton what does this say the goose the goose the goose the goose the goose why do you have words on your socks bro I don't know don't worry about it pissing me off about liberal I got [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] purple ass shoes like Easter Sun Kristal sinti will you guys get a pelt on me I will no what the what's the what's the value of having it with you why did you say it like that cuz I won't do that just say like maybe yeah no CU it's not a maybe it's it's it's like I want to know that you don't think that what he's asking is is it because I asked you a dumb question you made him feel dumb it felt dismissive dismissive it felt dismissive did you intend to dismiss him he' somebody else in the room say yes you know so we decided too close together would you say yes I don't think it was information he used if he said no would I say yes maybe I soften the below why won't you do it with me cuz we can just ride real bikes man oh like your bike yeah oh like your bike that you bought yeah how often did you ride that you I haven't ridden it in

trying toying were you going to be a bike to work guy H were you going to be a bike to work guy yeah and then I found out that I I I can't do the end of the ride without going up a gigant antic Hill every day it's hard so you don't want to do it yeah yeah it was meant to be like convenient there's no argument here when yeah when things are difficult it's like why Nick pelaton with you he just said yes isn't that nice doesn't like doing stuff with me no I'm that's true I'd actually be down cuz he's actually Immortal at pelaton so you wouldn't do it this is exactly what I my head I was like

had said yes [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] man you should have just said yes we'd all be so happy what I said in response to this question is what's the point of doing it together uh is there like a network you push yourself it's like it's like uh you can connect and you can ride at the same time the same in the same program and track each other's time and it's like working out together but not together it's

bike yeah is it $1,400 it has an lcd3 month I would write this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] off if I did it that I'll say that much I would do this and I would play COD on the screen that's what I'm saying that's
