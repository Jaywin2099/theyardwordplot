 it's sicking me like a dog I got him out the country no this is this is what I was going to say youve escalated the arms I'm losing the arms race you're just sending the assistants away You're them on flights away Jing's going to gu Lada that's the dance people are doing they're doing that dance he won't listen to [Music] me I'll get back on Jimmy f are we going going I just did I did the Slime what's that the Slime impression of lwig where I'm eating like a gross don't all you're I I uh you sound like Sora I was in line for coffee this morning and I I walk up and the line is like much longer than it normal is so I'm like debating like do I want to stand in this line or should I just go to the studio I was like okay I'll stand in line the moment I get in line this guy kind of like like you know walks in front of me and gets in front of line right before me like he's like he sees me get in line he kind of like sees like oh I want to get in line he gets in line it was kind of weird I was like oh he's he really wants that he really wants that that extra that EXT that like extra time yeah he probably more natural for me to go but he was technically closer kind of thing and I was just like oh sure whatever bro and then uh two seconds later actually two seconds later he tries to sneak a fart but it comes out extremely loudly how do how do you know I wasn't I wasn't at the coffee shop it wasn't me I I just say just say I know he's trying to sneak it because he just does like a small little cheek lift when he's in line like a little tiny movement that feels more public than a sneak who's trying to loudly fart in like a coffee shop the guy who mogged you honestly huge maybe it's on purpose I'm actually open to that but to me he was trying to sneak in and it comes out really loud can you do the sound with your mouth yeah I can try it was like it was [Music] like and and how did he react and and stone does not move he just stays completely still and I I Flinch like that's how loud it was I literally Flinch and I TR I I tried to turn my Flinch into looking at stuff so like I I go like this I go like and I like I'm like over here now I come like oh like the little there were something coffee bag so I'm getting mogged out out of the out of the planet and then it smells horrible it's like one the worst smelling Parts ever and it won't leave it just it's just like consuming me and I consider just leaving I consider just getting out of line you stuck through but I I stuck through I got it yeah those what does this guy look like um okay he looks like a guy you would see at REI shopping for like mountain climbing like boots is this the coffee shop that I ran into you at like last week no not that one no not that one cuz there's some weird people there yeah the vibe there is not good I agree it's a yeah everyone there is like uh they got like interior designer doesn't want to talk to you Vibes I had the opp I drove in my Miata and then I got coffee and then a couple came in after me a gay couple oh that's why you didn't the vies were off that makes sense off yeah cuz they shouldn't be in the in the building be you guys can't say that there's a t there's a tent that they can order from outside they shouldn't be allowed to come in say that the miloop gay well well well here we are now what who gets to say it now this get to say it you're no longer the the the the gay pass on the Pod sto on my opinion homophobia I get the gay pass on the Pod you guys should know this I'm the gamer of the Year [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he is the gamer of the Year G next year I am the gay one on the well I'm not gay but I'm I speak for the gays on the melee more gay why is straight man why a straight man what do you mean they chose a straight man for the gamer of the year a monogamous straight man they chose a white man for president okay what does that to do for with anything let's go really just a brain fumbler just like SM on that one white boy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lost and destroyed in the marketplace anyway the gay couple came outside died after I got my coffee to talk to me about my car that sounds terrible cuz they also have a Miata but they didn't get their coffee yet they just came out to talk to me about it cuz they saw me get in it yeah and then what's wrong with that I felt I felt costed you felt the cost felt costed but is it because alligator t-shirt it's not had nothing to do with their gay cuz did they say oh you look like Sora I love that game as a kid it was mostly because I wasn't prepared to answer the questions they're like what your Miata that's on you but then you're this is a person fake and my eye blinks you're losing the know check you know I do this constantly I look at cars on Facebook Marketplace all the time and I sometimes I'm like oh it' be so cool to like get a cool car and then I'm like well what is this on the how far on the spectrum of this car are they likely to ask me questions about cars that I don't know the answer to and if it's too far on that Spectrum I'm like I can't buy the car because of the the social embarrassment potential I go and they're like oh y she was my baby I took good care of her you know a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 8 cylinder right and I'm like eight C cylinder Square Subaru it's not just that that's funny if you know what the the Subarus are's some guy at home right now like eight cylinder Subaru like like a movie he slides out from under the car to to laugh FR dude you know on the on the topic of smell I was think about this you know that woman on Twitter that got eviscerated that beautiful woman because she made a pH D about like literary analysis about smell and all everyone was like this is our education system kill yourself and I I was thinking about this as an English guy as well over here guy with a bagel in his mouth America runs English guys he got the English He to it uh I was thinking we take so when that when people get a PhD they become doctors but there's a huge difference between a Doctor Who who like Works in a hospital and a doctor who like can deconstruct literature right I think that's fair one of them has a PHD and one does it uh well they have a doctorate yeah but they're still called doctors yeah so I think we have we should what we should do across the board yeah doctor that's for doctors the ones from the TV shows and we create a different name for the for everything else when you get your PhD I think this is a good idea I think this is my first good idea think Tekken King I think I Tekken King do you not think Tekken King players are going to run to the same thing oh and then it'll have to change Tekken King Tekken king is not a necessarily very high rank so or bu that just means more maybe they should be bushing is that the highest no it's lower the name has to be something you'd want to be called for sure cuz it's so much time I think God of destruction is the highest ranking they could be that so we'll call the academic doctors gods of Destruction beautiful woman who wrote about smell can be God of destruction whatever her name is this is my God of destruction destruction thesis yes you should be called like real learner real learner I think you should be more apt to what they do and also carry a bit of Shame real learner shame yeah like compared to doctor why would I be ashamed of being a real it needs to be worse than doctor it can't be Tekken God no you can't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] doctors and then you study English or 10 years and you're Tekken god king okay it needs to be worse than doctor yeah okay what if it's like nurse what's worse than nurse cuz the idea is that you went to school for this amount of time to achieve this Rank and it is lateral it's just in a different field but the word doctor has just been culturally accepted as guy sorry shouldn't say guy person saves lives we get we get rid of orthodontist cuz just make them dentists too dentist dentist too and then orthodontist becomes what you get called when you get your h d no I think this fre we free up the gamertag why orthodon we could do thing with something else that's way cooler isn't orthodontist better than dentist like what do you mean better what do you mean better what do you mean more better like those who can become doctors those who can't become dentists I don't believe them I don't think that's true this is true you think all dentists are failed doctors yeah famously that's famously dentist in the chat I'm sorry I don't represent this guy this is famously what happens to dentists ask your dentist my child ask your dentist they have no incentive to be honest about it my my childhood dentist's name was Dr Chu I don't think he ever wanted to be a doctor he wanted to be a dog that's a life a Lifeline he wanted to be a dog and was forced to his whole life no do you think like if you say to a dentist like oh you're an orthodontist he's like no I'm a dentist I think it's the opposite I orthodontist is like I'm a dentist and he kicks sorry I'm a big old [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] if I'm an orthodontist and someone calls me a dentist I'm just like I don't want to explain video games to them I'm like yeah it's like when you call your professor in college teacher or profess it's like they're not teachers they're Prof call Professor most of them aren't professors they are professors by Nature because they are teaching college yeah but like an actual professor professor title is rare at a college profess so you mean they can be an adjunct adun professors they're called that you're dumb I'm not Dum they make $40 a day don't say that Dum you don't know [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but no look up look up Arizona State faculty okay yeah by the way foram Devils know probably know what the Devils did this past weekend what they do they lost they what are you talking about we didn't go to your [Laughter] school went to Arizona looking at the who's Brin Brin this is so much of their information what what is this these are phone numbers Archie don't look at this yeah we can't dock some why did you do this because I remember looking at it and it they wouldn't have the title of Professor it would be like associate something like they would be like like 10 years they'd be like prefixed and you have to work for 10 years to get the actual title of real Professor it's political man those professors are at each other's throats trying to get tenure they call tenure is the dream yeah I learned that cuz my mom got it and then she was like yeah when people get tenure

FaZe official yellow check mark account Twitter zipper it was insane and sketch went up to their table and he just went around and did a band check yeah he did and I thought he was joking at first cuz he did like one or two of them but then he spent like five full minutes going around the table okay you take every award that was that was won at the streamer Awards and also the phas ones that were peed on yes and you sell them all are the ones that were peed on worth more or less than the ones that were not peed on let me after meeting stable Ronaldo I don't think anyone wants that guy's piss what does that mean I I'm just saying I think before meeting him I thought people wanted his pit before meeting him I'm like this guy's probably got some good hot piss that I met the guy cold piss cold piss no now Banks got his some of his penis and his piss on them damn peos both we might be talking you got the picture that might be a damn coin they might mint they might mint an nft out that damn piss asparagus piss Banks famously stinky piss I think I saw some blood in there go to the doctor he's got dare I say Banks got Swift piss don't say that dude don't come on it's on the pH official Twitter account ph up zipper yeah they went to the there's like basically one bathroom I think in that whole venue that's wild and it was actually lit because they had one of those attendees at the bathroom that would like get you the paper towel the attendance yeah yeah so this is uh this is just doing what Kanye did with the Grammys I think he did the same thing but it's funny cuz they're all yeah they they literally such a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] funny picture dud they took pictures Midstream of their piss someone's got an extremely large slit as a pee hole yeah also someone was the cameraman who didn't pee right so they were just standing in the middle of all their boys peeing around them and their job was to capture this someone replied second reply should have been me which is really funny oh my God and you can see Banks is not in here cuz CU he doesn't let his Squires who do you think's holding the camera no it's not B are you kidding me he is not the guy who who engages in the squir I think banks has someone hold it for him yeah of course yeah his penis or the camera inter and hold it for me I see his penis a real clan my nuts so Banks Banks is a is the guy I feel like like a lot of people know Banks as the the head of the team he comes out gives you the thank you speech for the organization and stuff like that yeah he's the guy who comes out goes dude [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] everyone's saying being 30 is too [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] old look what I did at [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 30 [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] five he did that for us yeah that was real why why is it him as opposed to temper or like the other people that ran the team that are in the same boat cuz he shouted out people like that when he thanked for the award but I never see temper around anymore cuz he is W hunger yeah W hunger they have L hunger they Tommy temper has L hunger to be clear he had W hunger and getting from zero to one is hard but sometimes you need that extra [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mph from a real neighbor to go one which who's banks in the is the the real neighbor also the other guy's in an L wheelchair no not anymore oh he he's strong as hell right now chill chill on nordon bro that's awesome someone someone he's smoking blunts on stream someone used to live in the same building as him I forget who but they're like yeah he's in the gym every day and he's huge no that's great he's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I think going from being like damn my legs are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up and then going and getting huge is actually pretty sick or you can do the opposite like Ronnie Coleman which is sad Ronnie Coleman yeah who's that he's like a bodybuilder who got really big and I was like Zone work oh that's sad because he got big yeah I think he like pushed his legs to their like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] limit and broke all his tendons back that's like uh Cali muscle C muscle had a heart attack I think was 35 or some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] look at bronnie Coleman um don't work out it's bad for you yeah it's bad for you and it has nothing to do with anything else outside of the workouts that's what's bad for you I was um images he's so gigantically huge that's what he used to look like and then can you do now oh yeah you can kind of see dude he looks like the gu's in power thirst that's crazy oh he can't walk no he can't walk [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that sad sad man but his upper body's crazy still though yeah you can see he still got it I was in uh I was in production I got worked a small job at the streamer award so my job was to like stable Ronaldo's interviews were going on simultaneously as valky and Sea Dog and my job was to with Jared basically clip uh interviews he was doing monitor that stream and then send it out to the main one and um he's pretty funny Ronaldo he's pretty funny and he had some good ones and it was funny because I thought about it like my job right now is glorified Clipper but I think I'm pretty good at it cuz I think every time he appeared on the main stream it was like one of front page of lsf oh that that felt kind of good and I was like yeah we curate I'm I'm a cur I'm a w Clipper as someone who missed the streamer Awards in a room full of three people who went to the streamer Awards give me your highlights and your low lights I want to learn my my highlight maybe low light who who's to say is where where we were sitting there was a a couple behind us who were maybe the most drunk I have I have ever seen both of them two both of them publicly publicly be drunk especially considering that it was the beginning of the the awards that this was already the case they showed up drunk they're like I maybe that's why I was confused cuz I was like time frame wise I actually don't know how you could get like this did you know who they were the free no I didn't rec you didn't look at the back of their chair I have their names I'm not going to say did you look at the back of their chair yeah okay cuz that's what we do all right he has their names we should I just said I have their say we should it on hours I think it'd be important what imagine right now you right on these on these I do it makes me feel special when there's a chair with my name on it they weren't on the back it's a different chair like oh okay I guess I have to sit there I don't think they've ever seen the back of our chairs this was also reminded me of I think it was like the second or the third award I don't know who the woman was but we had an angle from upstairs and cutie Cutie and Ma would be on that side stage off to the side and be like and now no or yeaha it's a different Asian woman that you mixed up m is Asian amazing recovery Aiden continues The Landing actually won they uh cutie is calling one of the presenters up to the stage and something's clearly going wrong like she's not coming out but from our angle in this corner of the building we can see that she's off stage trying to get up and keeps falling over oh was it um and then she got on stage to read the award oh my God and she got about two sentences in and it's very obvious this person is very very INX D at the end of the at the end of the night she was like a table behind us she would she just screamed I think six time I'm not even kidding six times like this it was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy it was like it was like she was being murdered she I can't believe got to what blew my mind was cuz she was late she was late to to get out right and cutie Cutie was wondering what was going on clearly and she when she got up on stage because there had been such a long gap of time where she wasn't there she said sorry uh uh we we had some mic issues with production and I was like there is no way production is getting a stray because you're too drunk to get up the stairs off stage only we could see it because we were in the right we had the right angle to see that she was falling over it's funny CU she also said it after yeah and then she just said it later she like there's a issue production and then later she goes and I fell I fell no one saw it but I fell so so it's around and it's it was funny how close to it it this happened but the per uh the couple behind sitting behind my row we hear like something crash and this this woman had fallen and I was like oh my God like is she okay and her date is sitting next to her and she has she has like collapsed out of the chair on the ground there's food everywhere because she's knocked [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] over and like McDonald's bags and he's just sitting in the chair like this he doesn't move an inch and I'm like dude what I'm looking around I'm like dude what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] help your date like what's wrong with you dude and other people have to like like Otto gets up a few other people get up to like help her get her shoes back on and climb back into the seat her shoes came off got hit by a car [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and then the guy gets up and he goes this was a social experiment the Jubilee video any points at me you didn't help he gets into a Lamborghini why didn't you help this woman um and I I genuinely I was about to get up to help and then I looked I looked at him and then I was frozen waiting for him the date to help until Otto got up on the other side and I yeah 's a hero I wouldn't want you in any situation if I start a heart attack on a plane please just continue sitting there you you draw DNR but what what I realized about 5 minutes later because zipper 3 tells me in my ear is that listen to him listen to him and he is wait he is as drunk as she is he's like rambling like behind us as like the show is going on and just saying like random [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he's like spayed over her wow like in the seats and both of them have like their shoes off there's food on the floor all around them and I'm and we're like this this is kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this is insane did they clean up the food when they left I know other other people have to clean it up I don't think they were like we haven't clean up the food and at some point at some point uh she gets up to go leave and do something right and it's only him sitting there and comes back maybe 10 15 minutes later this woman comes back and uh she she tanks again into the RO below her she like stumbles trips falls into relle richelle's food the glass the glass like case holding like the decorative plants and it's all like a bit of the glass shattered it goes into the row in front of them she also gets a small doelle Michelle's food and like Cutlery are on the floor and like she like land Ed on her for a second so I think it like hit her and and then and we're helping her get back up again and she goes and sits back in her seat and they're they're so loud and chaotic there's there's tomatoes and lettuce everywhere we're like surely they get kicked out like this is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] insane and then the two of them get up to leave like shortly afterwards together so we think they've they've gone I go get to get my row drinks later and I go to the bar I see them in the hall and they're still here like maybe like 20 30 minutes later just talking to each other they both can stand now so I'm like maybe things are picking up and I go over to the bar and uh the guy stumbles his way over the bar and he like tries to order and security comes up and is like no man cut off you're cut off yeah and then he gets into an argument with the security guy he's actually fine you have to protect your rights cuz cuz they don't know your limit they and they don't know cuz he if you if you're keeping score here he hasn't fallen once so that means he's good she's the one falling down shecks oer if I had throw up I could drive home alcohol and this this all this basically they don't really come back to their seats for the rest of the show I think us in the rows in front of us briefly talk about it and are happy about it people are like this is insane that they were doing this I'm glad it's over Afterparty happens later we're at the corner of the Afterparty by the bathroom and zipper 3 and Michelle are standing by the door closest to it and they see this guy they the these two this couple came into the party earlier and we saw them like Beam for the VIP VIP area they get turned away they don't have the right band whatever and then guy jumbles into the bathroom and and is in there presumably alone and the security follows him to the bathroom like a couple minutes later and they're like did that did that guy go in there to to zipper 3 and they they got comtable they pop open the door they pop open the door and this dude is is over the Ural like doing the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's classic and and and then he gets removed from the bathroom and I think kicked out of the party but I they don't kick him out of the party they just remove him from the bathroom I thought he got I thought he got got kicked out I think he got kicked out by himself because like 15 20 minutes later you can see his date walking around the party talking to people like I think looking for him I don't think she knows that he got I think I saw him walk into a painted tunnel that said VIP VIP over she's like whatever guys I can't find him I'm just going to uh use this plunger that says TNT on says acne it's F it'll be fine so that was like I think they were honestly my highlight and my light H you know what they say boys what do they say the darker the bones the sweeter the juice m i kind of see what you're getting at I see where you're going with this you know what I'm saying you know sometimes I take the cardboard off of my Factor meal and I can see it's going to be a juicy ribeye cuz of the print you're saying Factor meals have different print allocations see different print on the outside of the box and you go oh this

this aen have you heard about this you heard about there's there's flam in these Factory me flaming the darker the flam andon the sweeter the juice yeah like the darker the asparagus that's probably burnt but the darker the I guess you know the shrimp maybe could be sweeter the darker the 35 meal choices the sweeter the juice sweeter that juice too Aiden but the thing is you didn't think about that choices because the sweet of the juice well there's 35 Plus different meal choices in Factor's got the damn sweetest meals there is they got protein plus 30 g of protein and more the darker the protein the sweeter the juice what if I want to what if I want to add something on plus option stupid question next I guess I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] He's musling through this I've given you all the

thing is happening he's doing a terrible job of explaining how this person died but chii just kind of takes over and then from my perspective I'm like oh that's it's interesting that chii like who has an Australian accent from what I can tell flew on the same flight here espresso and then and then chii it's almost as if chib can hear what I'm thinking he stops he's like I know it sounds like I was on this flight but I actually I've just heard this story so many times that I figured I'd explain it better dude New Zealand he's a kiwi a kiwi doesn't sound like one it's funny cuz I I uh I heard about this from squeaks squeaks was my highlight cuz I was next to him and I was next to lwig and I was like this just feels nice I can turn to my left and a guy is quick and and makes me laugh and I turn to my right and a guy is insanely drunk and also makes me laugh and keeps screaming and it's going to drive home and it's going to drive home very as fast as he can I get better the more I do it yeah and uh and so squeaks cuz I didn't see pres the whole night I was very I was a ghost I did the thing downstairs and I showed up and I was at table and I went home and um squeeze like did he someone died on preo's flight and I was like what he's like yeah and I immediately was like do you think it changed him and squeaks was like I don't think so at all preso would just nervous laugh and then he said prezos told him he's like at least it happened toward the end of the flight so they didn't have to turn around yeah so it wasn't like a smell problem and I was like that makes sense smelled I'm not even Rec's making that detail up he doesn't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fcking know he was asleep in 10 rows behind oh my God what preo did that night by the way after a guy died on his plane is go to a gay bar lose his passport and then tell people he lost his passport I I saw that I was like maybe we put him on the Primo as punishment we make him tell the story again you you said you were a ghost because when we were leaving to go to the Afterparty zipper 3 wanted to go downstairs and say hi to you specifically she says we should go find slime I want to go say hi to slime so go down in the venue we're looking for you we're surveying everywhere can't spot you and then she's like oh that's him that's him over there we start walking towards no come on dead ass please don't say this is going to happen sear in the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] harkening outfit so mad it wasn't dude it wasn't a joke she points and I realize that we're walking towards seir in the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] zipper pull up uh Sears Twitter are see why s yeah I'm knock your dumb ass out next time I see her holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] SE in Peach Char yeah yeah you're right you're right zipper 3 that was uh you just missed me I was wearing my armor looks like Caleb pits it does look yeah yeah I was wearing my cool alien armor and my and my weapon fny she separately got approached by Peach who is also in this outfit withal at the after party Peach and a bald cap just comes up to her and cuz she we were standing next to the bathroom and he like peach peach comes up to her and says can you please undress me she she's like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] did just say to me EXC watch stop and it's she just needed to be unzipped from the suit in the bathroom you know and then they were helping uh helping each other but I thought that was funny she managed to meet both of these people oh my sorry he's like afraid of very Dem it's such a sick clip he goes I made a song you want to hear it and then he just says like Mongolian throat singing and just starts dancing and then they leave pretty certain like man I should have been she wearing is she wearing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] contacts those her eyes I it's contact they kind of go all out uh you know what else funny about squeaks is that I was I was a Mongol can't hear it by the [Music] tonight was the best clip of the night thing about squeaks was uh he it was so funny cuz he he leaned in and he was like I've been watching your streams cuz I'm like I'm like that's very touching to me cuz I just grind league and I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] scream at my Monitor and I see him in chat sometimes and I'm like oh and uh that that's nice and he's like he's like my favorite part is when you yell at people I was like oh you like that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he's like I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] love it and I'm like good to know good to know he wins award for best speedrunner which is really funny it is pretty funny he walks up uh and he he gives this entire speech about like positivity it's so easy to be negative it's so easy negative just be positive for for [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] two minutes he's he he gets on his soapbox about how and he loves positivity and how people here are making positive things and that matters and then [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] behind closed doors he goes I love when you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tell me he said he said and he and he got like real low he's like it's my favorite part you told if you were to blow this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] smooth off you do that every day I do it too what do to do with that's the funny part he's a human in there when they say jungle diff after he like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up a gank and he looks at that and he tells him to blow the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] off smooth I'm like he's real people who I play with but by the way they're changing this right is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me cuz right now what I do is I tell the person who I'm playing with that I want them to die but I type in the chat damn my bad GG yeah right I've I've never typed into the team chat really like horrendous thing but I've said them and now Riot announced that in January they're going to switch it so if you as the streamer start saying horrible things about your teammates you'd be punished as if you said it to them that's honestly fair I think it's so unfair I think I think it's unfair I think it's fine because it this this someone who crashes out day daily crash outs live because if I there's 2,000 people in a chat and their gamer name is on there and I am telling them to go blow their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] off smooth I don't find I if I get away with it All is fair but if I don't I'm not going to be like well that's not cool like it's worse to say it to an audience does the rule apply if you can anonymize your teammates names no I I think it shouldn't I don't think they specified but I didn't consider that I interpreted the rules more as you're right it probably extends to that I interpret it more as like if a pro player insults like another player on like Twitter that that can be punished like it was said in game oh I I I don't think it was related to play I think I think that's true though I think that's part of it encompassing like it they can evaluate behavior that happens they're evaluating Behavior outside of game and punishing you in game for it with the police state as soon as a CEO gets walked down in Broad day it turns out we're all being watched by them if you smoke weed outside of California you can get AB Bandon valant I hear that's true um also what was I going to say about squeaks Bears um no he was great uh oh yeah he so green saigi was there who is the goat yeah like you watch those those speedruns and they are magic and you're like damn this kid is just he solved the game and and Sak was like I was like you better go pay respects and he's like I will like The Godfather and so he's like he went and like you know got a picture with green SW and it's like it sheepishly held his that like was you know fan voted obviously but it was very funny like a sky like s going and paying respects to like a 16-year-old like Lis Al I'm so sorry this was like the biggest drama award kind of yeah it wasn't streamer of the year it wasn't G's tweet cuz he just being really kind but the phrasing was so subtly funny cuz he was like like squeak's so cool such a great streamer who started running at the same time oh that's so Z start Mele and Zay started playing at the same time too don't really to hear though I told squeaks he should just post his like 70 star time which is like awful he's like sorry sweaties yeah I also think everyone who's mad doesn't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] watch Mario 64 true watch a Carl Jes video and they're like yeah he's the goat but like they don't even [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] watch noi was one of the only people I went up to at this one to like introduce myself and say like hi like congrats and like great work I was going to do that with speed but I was too nervous isn't that funny speed mhm I saw speed I met him you met speed I said hey what's up man have you not met him before this no no there's never opportunity he's ever been a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the only questionable decision I saw I didn't watch the whole thing I didn't watch part of it was xqc getting to do the final award that was cool he didn't care at all it seemed he made a funny joke uh he was like I guess we're watching some video or whatever no he had a good joke no he he he lit up the audience cuz he went he went no I heard his joke before he's like I used to win these Awards it was fine it just seemed like he didn't care but then he said this study the fallof should be studied which is good the the award was literally like read by Tina before like Tina went through all five nominees and then it kind of explained like a oneliner of why they're nominated so X's job was to just get the video rolling like he did not have to be like yeah it's pirate off Cena did that right before he went up Tina being the hostess is really funny too cuz the last stream award she was so afraid to present one she was like begging for a tequila sh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah and I was cuz I was right there before her and she was like ah she was like freaking out and I'm like she's hosting and that's cool that's gross she kill this time yeah it great she did great job dude my highlight was the bathroom the bathroom has cigarettes and like in the little like little 25 cent thing yeah it was like it was like the person who works and they like they have a bunch of paper towels and they give you paper towel like the moment and it's like well I can also just yeah but I'm like okay all right and then they have like a little tip jar you can get colog and usually all those things I don't care about mint colone whatever sometimes they got sour stuff in there sometimes they got like crybaby drops this time they had damn cigarette cool and pancake I was talking to sear and I was I was like I was like there's cigarettes in there and right and wraith wraith WTH food hardar the Harin right what OHA smoke that and so he goes in and he and he tips $10 and he's like can I have a cigarette and they're like ah it's two bucks and he's like that yeah get them get more out of them he's like he's like okay so he gives him another 10 he's like okay can I get a few he gives him two cigarettes okay and then and then and then she's like okay and then he's like you want to smoke him and then lights his lighter in the bathroom in the the bathroom in the bathroom oh you got to do that there and serious like serious like I'll just take them and smoke them somewhere else that's so awesome but they were down to just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] have them light up in the bathroom that's kind of that's cool you got to do it I don't that I I've only ever seen a bathroom attendant once in my life and it freaked me out I was like this is doesn't this doesn't make sense I there's like they're in venues quite a bit they're in Vegas all the time but I've never out of Vegas I don't see it much I don't like it no one should have to sit in a bathroom all day as their job yeah it's also just such a like no one's got cash and it's like yeah not anymore if I do have cash my soppy hands don't want to reach down and grab it this ain't 1965 it ain't used to be King crypto's King krypto's King crypto King not cryp say crypto's king king it shouldn't have sold your Bitcoin krypto's King I've been paying paying everything in in uh in Haley Welsh only currencies my is I've been paying I've been paying with only hers she uh she going to jail I don't think she is she going do some damn time I don't think I don't think she's going to jail maybe I don't know anyone who's gone to jail for crypto SC it's well I mean SPF did it's hard it's hard to go to jail that was a crypto scam that was like fraud that's what a scam is that's actually the definition of not create a when I was technically correct earlier it's happening again this is not that this is not that what SPF did is so different using it as a comparison just cuz they're both in the scam is fraud they're synonyms you're being you're being a little stubborn a little yeah a little bit thickheaded here uh I I understand what you're saying no I don't think she'll do time but I was following this like a hawk Tua because I was on the Twitter I was on X and I was playing I was playing League I was playing league and I I look over cuz I have it on my other monitor and it's like the truth the the it was like the truth Tua or some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] some stupid pun and it was literally Hale wch and like her weird like crypto like cabal just explaining that it's not a scam Banks is in there uh Connor got handed the mic for a hot second coffeezilla obviously he dropped his video on a second Channel it was it was just such a fun Saga to watch and yeah I lost everything on on the you know you're in trouble when you got Banks Conor E's pants and coffeezilla against you that's a hard group to get to they rely align on allank banks was on the it's a scam side Banks was like Banks was like talking on like some kop like Roi type like you could tell he had done crypto [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] before a lot he's like yeah this one just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this doesn't make sense this is like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] terrible roll out that's a good look for him I mean Banks's whole thing is that he's heavy in a crypto yeah but if someone is a bad actor in The crypto space it makes his crypto Holdings worse right high tide raises all boats and a b St uh phase up raises all uh W's all goats it's funny that he was talking about like you know he he gave the award he's like no one knew the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like who the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is St ronal who the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is Jason the and I think I've realized he's just recruiting young dudes with no upper body strength and like that and like just making them into Superstars and I think that's really special he searches the streets of Los Angeles for young boys that he can mold into his own no those guys are cool they're surprisingly cool for how young and C he was doing the same thing when he was in Phase the trickshotting team and inor the trickshotting team dude I told I texted Nick this me this is actually my highlight it was my friend getting Laurels because that that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that big recap video one of my low lights of the thing was that everyone no one was really paying attention so when people were talking it was like they were talking to No One except the stream but everyone no one really paying attention to people talking but when the video started playing the recap of like the whole year it was Coco melon it gagged them it was Coco melon and so everyone's watching like a hwk and one of the clips was Nick Anders gaming hitting his insane trick shot in in Call of Duty and FaZe Adapt because they were right behind us he literally goes who hit that and I look over at him and I'm like SL slime texted me I texted him be and I looked over like that's my friend that's my son I did son hit that shot was like if you look at if you look at the the moment on stream cuz I went and found it after he said that the camera that's meant to be looking at people in the crowd watching the video is just covering my camera yeah so it's just like so it's just the clip and then it you just can't see me your facebob pointing me yeah you can see his crusty crab hat uh that was my highlights low lights you guys might have noticed I'm checking my phone a lot yeah I oh God I have to I have to explain why I have to explain why cue is on her first ever flight in three years to go see Taylor Swift why she'll never fly with prezo ever again probably oh de batt I I I don't think she knows cuz she was so busy yesterday and like like no please nobody and I'm itching I'm itching cuz here's the thing she's also going to Canada dude so so I'm I'm itching to tell the story and talk about it on the car ride after we left stream rewards I'm like can't talk about it no can't talk about it we have to preserve all of this but I didn't think she'd get on uh we wake up this morning she gets up at 9:00 her flight's at like 11:45 and she's like she's like I don't want to go I'm tired I'm like I'm like okay it's I don't feel like you're going to go back to bed so yeah like you're going to be tired whether you go or not go that's what you said it was funny you explained this earlier and you're like I was kind of a dick I was like I was a little but I was like you know that's a bad excuse and I was like I don't think you're being a dick I just I think it's a sensitive I was aloof she was like she was like I'm tired I was like that's too easy like that's too easy dude I've gotten that tone from L before and then and then Maya comes and he's like I I think he means that like it's good to have exposure to even like go to the airport even if you don't get on the flight and I'm like I'm like it's one way of saying it not I would have phrased it uh and then anyway uh my starts packing and she's being the nice one she's like with this dress or this dress for tonight he's like that dress and then they start packing and then they're supposed to Uber uh but you know I'm getting the vibe that I should drive her I should go boyfriend mode and so uh the gang gets in the car but she's made it such that there's a very low chance they make it cuz we're going to the airport with like 30 minutes before the flight leaves insane which maybe if you live in like a small town it's kind of normal LAX that is not normal it's about 15 minutes to get through security uh and we're driving yeah and we're driving and she's and like it's it starts out great like she's making jokes and and she's talking about Taylor she's singing Taylor songs Maya Maya's airplane food into her mouth and she's like the times were good blades are fun uh she's even vlogging okay yeah and then and then I'm just like I'm running through the checks right I'm I'm dad mode here and I'm like I'm like we got our passports and Kitty's like of course I my passport and then MAA from the back seat's like oh no I'm like M what's up he's like I forgot my passport rotten [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's to what is she not no what why can't call her but she forgot it yeah that's just she made a mistake she made a mistake it makes her rotten don't yeah but doesn't make her the second part made mistake about this beautiful apparently Asian woman apparently Asian so may forgets her passport and the issue is we don't have time to turn around yeah it's tough because we don't make the flight anymore and we can't buy a new flight because cue is like buying the flight's the hardest part because it's got to be this Airline this aircraft whatever yeah and she doesn't want to be the aircraft that went down in Mexico that Air France was flying that killed people to years ago yeah that this is all fear an's fault they talked about it on the podcast they went to death about a plane crash that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up it's given her nightmares for a few months there's like there's L and less commercial Aviation accidents every year it only get it's crazy how it only gets safer and they bring up the contrary to the contrary to the Boeing controversy we should get a veteran on our show and then just make loud noises we have ours our firework episode new fear and bit uh okay so no passport so no passport the good news is they're not flying to Vancouver they're fanking to Seattle and then driving to Vancouver okay for no reason other than cue thought that was better safer cuz she didn't have to fly Del Air Canada she could fly Delta she likes Delta cuz they're safer Delta cuz they're safer yeah I don't know I'll let her say believe whatever she goddamn wants doesn't matter what she doesn't matter what the facts are it matters what she believes also Delta is serving Shake Shack on planes now this is not fig I did not make that up that's real on Shake Shack and you get free Foams In First Class mhm so my doesn't need a passport and we're driving I'm trying to figure out a solution I call my uh Canadian representative Aon gimon I'm like aan you throw someone in the trunk no you're not asking aan to smuggle persons across the St you smuggle someone across the state line it's not even a state line it's a crunchy line you know any coyotes said oh myy qu hook up from back home I said he could do that I just said you know caught consequences are high are they they just don't let you into Canada no they can't punish you they arrest you for trafficking I think but if you didn't get in you didn't traffic anything so attempted murder is also a crime but attempted trafficking is like how can the Canadians punish me I'm not from there yeah and I never evening and I never got in there I just attempted to get in there and then did it you know what I'm wrong what did I do thank you the other thing is you got to do it both way well and maybe the US they let it I think we could get the passport with more time easier true so anyway uh then uh I have the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and as we get closer cu's losing it she starts to see the planes like when you go to LAX there's just a parking lot of planes yeah and she's like they're so big she she sees like tanks in her head yeah yeah like a Korean airplane takes off and she's like she's like goes so high I'm like yeah it's kind of the that's kind of how it works yeah that's kind of how it works uh and then she starts really losing it when when she's getting out and I i' I'm letting her go at this point I can't follow her in uh and I'm getting text updates and she's losing it meanwhile I'm working with Aiden and then I I had to buy Christian a flight directly to Vancouver he has to drive down to the Border give the passport to my house so they can drive up through the border and they're going to swap this is a this is to avoid flying straight to Canada this is to make sure they can go to Taylor Swift tonight yeah that's no matter what my needs are passport yeah May needs are passport there's an episode in the amount of time it would take Christian to fly to Canada they could go back and rebook a flight right and then fly straight to Canada this flying to Canada is not an option but rebooking the plane will crash the plane of course the plane crash rebooking would be what most people do rebooking would cause the crash I would argue that and that's what she kept doing she' she' she'd be like is her not having a passport to sign and the car like no nope actually it's actually the opposite of a sign so I have me and C actually pretty similar I think I've just worked on this stuff like more but I one time it was actually the last flight we took uh there they when we went to don't park it was me and Mike on the flight and we sat on the tarmac for like an hour and the the the lady kept going all right we need 20 people off this plane or it can't take off there's another plane that will get to Seattle 2 hours later and it was just like uh and everyone's like standing around like playing mafia with each other finally 20 people leave and then apparently that FL plane got cancelled and so that had 20 people came back and they're like okay there's another one did the same PE 20 people want to go it was crazy anyway while this is all happening I don't I don't fear flying but I often you just hate not having control in the air and I was like is that the death plane or is this the death plane is this the moment right I'll have that thought a lot with planes and so I understand where she's coming from so when something goes wrong and it's like maybe I wasn't meant to be on it like Seth McFarland and I'll make Family Guy later you know dude I had I had I think I had my I heard an ant scream moment cuz I was on my plane to Jersey don't mock my culture I was on my plane to Jersey and uh our flight got delayed and we got on the plane and the the the pilot gets on the thing he's like yeah really sorry we're running behind uh so we're just going to put more fuel in the plane so that we can go faster than normal so uh we'll get there as fast as we can and then when we land I slept in the flight uh I wake up and the flight attend says all right we're done the flight was uh 3 hours and 40 minutes and I was like can you get to the east coast in 3 hours and 40 minutes they can just do that but he said that and I was like there's no way it was that it was that short but I was just like asleep didn't really check the time I was like that's crazy we got there so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fast and I was like can you do that on all planes can you just put in more fuel just go faster yeah and and then our flight back was so much longer it's a fuel fuel efficiency thing so like they fly at a certain it's like in a car speed to like maximize fuel efficiency this whole [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] time this is why when you fly private it's so much faster oh also I assume the weight of the plane they go faster dude it spends less fuel yeah F and it's faster on the way back I was like everything I understand about how long it takes to get somewhere in the world is just wrong it's just based on whates do no it's the same like you base you base getting from point A to point B based off like the speed limit right so just think of it as the air speed limit sure you ever I mean it's we break the speed limit I'm say yeah basically you broke the speed limit but the limit's not based off of but are we allowed to do that there's not like air cops and it's not like if you go a little faster it's more dangerous there's a lot of space in the air you ever see that window over [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] John about the suic planes no the Concord yeah the Concord the reason why economically viable it wasn't for a lot of reasons one of them no one wanted to hear Sonic booms all day yeah that's annoying they were really loud loud when you break the sound barrier they're bringing them back I thought bringing back the booms I thought They're bringing back the boom [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] oh my God would the greatest marketing campaign is Concord hiring the Costco guys and every time there's a Sonic boom people on the ground are like everyone instead of being mad goes boom boom boom that's three booms that's three planes that took off from JFK cool I think I think boom Airlines just hit the Pentagon dude imagine Osama Osama hijacking Marines [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that would suckler could have stopped that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the rler if the rler and Mark Wahlberg were on the plane he would have he would have rode Mark Wahlberg like Alchemist in DotA like yeah dude my my cousin I was at a wedding um in in the east coast and my cousin said something kind of profound she was like she was talking more specifically about my family but I felt it could be extrapolated to like all of New York she was like uh they run they run off of minor inconveniences like they don't have one in their day it's like they didn't have their coffee and uh I was like oh that's really funny and I got to the airport and I started noticing it everywhere in New Jersey to come home this this kid walks up to a woman and he's like explaining he's like hi like I'm really late to my flight is it possible I can cut in front and she goes I'm not I'm not exaggerating I'm not kidding she goes yeah yeah why don't you just go she doesn't even look at him why don't you just go right ahead why don't you just go in front of me to a child to to like you know he's probably like 24 okay a younger guy and and he he just freezes he's just like and then he just stays behind her but he's made all this progress of people who have said yes so he's just kind of awkwardly in the middle of the line now W but she was so Inc mad about it that he's like I can't walk in front of her or ask the next person he's embarrassed and then I was like wow that's crazy then I get on my plane and uh we're we we land in LA but all the same people and we're de booring and uh an elderly Asian woman who uh I learned ases not speak English from this interaction just lightly bumps an elderly Indian woman on the plane's arm as she's like trying to get her stuff and the woman goes say you are sorry to me and the woman just kind of turns and she doesn't know what's going on and she can't reply either she's people from New Jersey are demons and she just she just kind of like puts her thumbs up like and she goes and she goes you bump my arm say you are sorry to me and she just she just like kind of smiles cuz she can't and then the woman just turns away like just gruntled at the interaction this is why The Sopranos is set in New Jersey D I was like this is so insane everybody was so mean they they're they that's how slime talk sometimes no not to normal people that situation to me well yeah cuz you deserve it love guys I'm tired of wearing chain mail as underwear why you liked it it keeps catching on all my pubic hair and it hurts you bought the chain mail you said all this time I can't wait to pretend I'm a medieval night some people keep swinging swords at me and I'm I'm afraid my Junk's going to get cut off and it'll block it and it did you did all this yourself and it it did more circumcision that I wanted it took too much off the top how many times me and a been chilling way I don't know what to do there's no other options I can't find any other underwear options you know what we've been doing hanging out butt ass except for one item and that's our underwear our meundies underwear on oh meundies we're hot and smelly all day but you know what keeps us cool and nice our meundies is comfy it's probably also made of chain mail so it's probably uncomfortable it's not though it's so comfortable it's so incredibly comfortable and I know what you're thinking how could we both be wearing it because he has a weird [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up warped body and I have a normal physique yeah a beautiful physique but me has a cup for everyone 20 different styles the same underwear that he uses the same I think yours is different mine is way it's mine is normal like I'm wearing chain but he's weird so even a weird guy like me with weird bones can buy me y well that's that's awesome and if and if you if you're one piece you rather be wearing they also have uh joggers hoodies onesies well I've been wearing full chain mail to sleep do they have any sort of like loungewear options or anything that's not made of chain mail yeah pretty much all of it is breathable stretchy and comfy making it ideal for all day unlike chain mail which we told you was a bad idea and you just kept doing it also it was at the Rick store you seem you seem concerned that they only sell they don't sell chain mail at all Me Andy doesn't sell their industry in fact it's mostly it's in it's just reasonably sustainably Source materials and work with partners that care for their workers your chain mail actually came from some coffee shops only have oat milk I guess anyway knock out all

thanks he was at our table and I I went up to him I was like lewick doesn't like your face you said that to him yeah and he's like what you said he looks ugly on a podcast like a second ago I was like I didn't mean that what do you mean what do you mean he doesn't like it it's like I don't know he said says he says you're more handsome with a beard he's like he sound like he's my girlfriend I'm like I know I told him that too that was the first when I opened the stream when I landed after my flight the first thing I saw on stream was him with a shaved face and I go is this a recap clip from like an old streamer Awards or or just the current streamer I actually couldn't tell and I I show my girlfriend and she's like that that's not even him she's like that's not a sea dog and I'm like no it's definitely SE dog I can't tell what year and she convinced it's not him she still does not think that him not even just that I I felt like cuz I had seen him just the day before with the beard and then transition to watching streamer Awards somebody come out in this outfit from honai Star rail talking and I was like oh my God that is Conor and then the same thing happened with the iron Mouse like music video that that male character in the music video is is Conor's voice and I was like oh my oh my God so he uh he had to shave because he did this cosplay with pon pon from honkai Star rail he's a he's a handsome guy you got a you got a cute wife he's a handsome guy it's just it's just like I feel like I'm you know having sex with a 19-year-old when he shaves his beard with hot dog Herold yeah and when when his Beard's out that's diesel Derek I'm I'm having sex with 19-year-old diesel D like how hot dog Harold got you there though hold on yeah uh so anyway he had the sh I just prefer can I say I prefer my boyfriend the beard is that too much to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] say as the gamer of the Year refuse to accept he looks bad without it he just looks boyish yeah I just he's a very attractive used to it that's dude that's what I told him I was like L will could get used to it it's fine he's like he's like why are you talking like this uh yeah we're about to spend 100 hours together yeah how's I going to what's that what's the plan leag week League week's supposed to start at 3 and it's going to go until I guess Thursday at 7 pm wow is is is League gonna be one of those things for you where when you finally hit plat you just never play again he yeah yeah yeah ideally I mean it'll come up like in five saacks will there be any car outs on kind of a 100 hours straight 100 hour straight straight situation carve out really carving out many or any of the days though oh no it's good my G Aiden you guys you think it's a little joke I knew this was coming up I knew this was coming up I've been asking for days we keep it iry but Aiden Aiden fights for Ludwig's time in the way I used to and presumably cutie still does dude and I have new dude I have a new system and it's been it's been kind of it's been working what you how did you how' you solve the problem I solved it because I weaponized I weaponized his assistant he sicked two dogs on me two dogs that he worked with the two dogs the two dogs uh who are very effective at their job Yingling and Christian Hound lwig every day they're at his house in person and they and they him you understand the strategy has has blowback because when you ask Christian to ask lwi a question without us in the room lwig is more comfortable in saying no to stuff yeah like Christian said that L wanted to just not do the premium this week as an option dude getting a no fromr us feels [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] miserable tell you I'm not going to lie no you've never said it before I've said it before I've said Christian said that you suggested not doing the premium at all not even us as there's a mcom this is what I thought therec I assume there's a misc it seemed weird for you to suggest it was that look upan love our patrons please he loves you so much he's one Christian said that you said that we should cut the Primo entirely I I I think I might have just not explained it to him clearly cuz I don't think he understands you only give him three words as answers I I give seven not do Primo and I got him I you give orange eat me give you orange sicking me like a dog I got him out the country no this is this is what I was going to say you've escalated the arms I'm losing the arms race you're just sending the assistant away You're My Flights away Yo's going to gu laada to fight the cartel to give to give Maya her passport at The Other Board just in we don't know what Bor she's going to that's going to be his tag on Star GG's NAFTA Yingling oh oh update pup date no we're good I had a also at my wedding I did some I did some Intel cuz I I had to meet a bunch of relatives that I didn't know I had and I was I realized I was in a prime position to see are the men in my family balding or not oh huge yeah and so I I was asking my dad and I was like who's that who's that and he was like oh he's like you're good my dad didn't bald until he was 70 wow I was like my dad is hair so I was like let's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] go that's huge let's go it's it's Mom's dad though all my go all my all my male relatives that I was related to still had hair it's Mom's father look like what's the mom's don't know that's the trth okay so that's the one it like com this this is a myth uh no I think it just comes down to like higher probability of genetics not necessarily a myth yeah but it's not like pent Square can can point to a higher probability not like you're doomed good news what do we got the Xanax kicked in let's go I took 40 uh 40 xans on a plane cuz I'm scared I'm had me out for my life it's a little Drake humor little Drake humor for you guys the you know what remember when I stopped you from doing your favorite Drake song at the end of the episode in Australia I I made fun of you so much you never did it again his bits where he' be like and your Drake song of the weekend oh yes I saved you yeah Loki cuz if you had kept doing that like for a year and then it's beef you would have been like the white DJ to Kendrick song of the week yeah that be I just wouldn't had any I actually I had this listen to him on my on my little music replay I listened to So Much Drake in the first three months of this year wow that he was on my top five artists on Apple music but when you make the image like when you export that little share me image apple music cuts it off at three instead of 5 so it cut Drake out of the picture and it was like a big year to have to cut Dr out I'd like I'd like to say I was wrong about something cuz we had we had an argument a long time ago where I was like I don't think the beef will affect how many people listen to him sure and if you asked me without the stat I'm about to bring up I might still defend that as an idea I think he still has a bunch of listeners or whatever this was the first year Drake wasn't on my wrapped so you yourself as a data myself stopped listening I mean we could just look it up no I don't know I didn't really think about it I just kind of stopped listening can you see do you think without he was on it like the last three years do you think without the beef you would have listened to him probably W you still putting out like huge songs n he's definitely down right wait I I can't tell if that's really high my rap was wrong that's why I didn't post it it was not wrong just I didn't listen to Tool that much you I guys I promise I love that band I'm 34 I understand but I just didn't and I don't know why it's saying I did I should show Banks my wrapped in his in his 30-year-old post he was like in one of the at the very bottom of the dash list it was like listen to net spend in two Hollis and those are my top two this year dude Alex Alex is extremely plugged in he he his wrapped he was just like 30 and plugged in or whatever and um I I messaged him about it cuz it was funny and he's like dude people are telling me to kill myself wait why can you look up Alex smokes mid zipper on Twitter uh I looked it up Drake has 73 monthly or million monthly listeners wait so he has gone down cuz used to be at like 85 I don't think he was that high I think he like 75 or 77 I don't think he's cuz Taylor's supped at 93 yeah but he was in the he was one of the biggest on the site he used to be in the 80s for sure we launched sour man we launch sour man also sour man is live so yeah 30 and tapped in Jesus mine is honestly pretty close I didn't I didn't listen to Blade that much that's awesome his favorite artist and uh yeah and he got it he's it's funny because he loves this music genuinely but he is 30 and he's gonna have to hold that lwi did you have one do you listen to music yeah I posted my Spotify wrapped I think I commented oh yeah cuz like I was like I don't think it's pull up I was like why does why don't you have M DeMarco yeah wasn't on there my mine was basically what I listen to when I play League of Legends it's not on Twitter I just post on Instagram it is literally just what I listen to when I League of Legends so it was like uh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nujabes and Jo NJ was on Arcane theme um uh yeah yeah you got to play silver scraps game five Robinson probably oh my god did you guys know silver scripes where's my phonei silver scraps can you go to YouTube scraps are made of silver and look up uh lwig three minute guide he said it so confidently look at what lwig thre minute guide on YouTube oh my God I haven't watched this I think it'd be cuz this guy he makes League of Legends like three minute guides and you it's nice to pull up when you're in a matchup you don't know and it's like why play FID six jungle so so the guy made a lwigs guide to fiddle sticks jungle wait can you play this oh my God so excited I'm so excited present we need I watch this ad every time I pull this video up that's awesome that's crazy that's a play Fiddlesticks Jungle there's like those three minute videos why you should play carus jungle yeah by the way great impression ludwick's guide for Fiddlesticks Jungle after watching learning last few months this is where he could improve starting off is his warding looking at this com 30 he's already there this is great what they should do now with a player Advantage is walk into the enemy jungle and get Wards everywhere this will let lck's team have perfect information and be able to counter anything they try to do however lwig hasn't bought a control Ward and only has one FG available he uses his Effigy here which is good as it makes sure the opponent doesn't have vision of him but if he had a control W to place here place his Effigy deeper and thrash actually warded on this side he'd have much more information of the entire enemy jungle and be a toeing eff unfortunately as they only have control of this area lwig is forced to play in the brush which ultimately leads to a lost team fight buying these control Wards and making you lost team fight okay zipper it's good okay I watch that whole thing later I'm so excited buy Wards but maybe I'll buy Wards P 20 who who told you that uh Luda Luda from Genesis 3 and Dr battle you're using your mods Tim Tim just sends me de Deep Web lwig rage every every day he he he just literally Clips video files of lwig screaming at people um that's awesome I have set up measures for League week to not tilt I don't think that's true I've set up measures tomorrow I have a pack of dogs coming nine uh I don't know how many I hope I hope it's nine but it's going to be puppies that come that we get to play with like like oh like therapy puppies this is your uh this is your Kai and speed uh chained chained up Minecraft I I I think I'm going to try to get a sports psychologist out I have Robert on on the on the line wait the same dude that you talk to for that one Red Bull thing yeah yeah Aiden didn't like him how did Aiden know him I met him what didn't you like him he clearly had a strong disdain for the fact that people played games seriously in any fashion but that's what makes him great he has a better perspective I don't I don't need his perspective to be from a gamer's POV I want it to be I want it to be like so yeah you doing this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] video game [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like when I hang out with a a ad right a basketball player right he oh he loves name dropping to he's a name dropp heang ofall players me and AD are at boa and yeah we got the wagu fight we got two ad always gets the wagu when we go there together ad loves wagu and what was that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] gay gay [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] game you play again oh yeah yeah when there's four guys alive and there's five I don't know sounds tough and then you have to fill for the next box it's AP for me I'm I'm flooded out on my wrist now ad I can't believe it we didn't even talk about the game you feel how cold this is he going to lock me in we're g to have Connor as our pizza man Connor's pants okay you going come give us pizza if we're sad nice uh that's badass and I have a couple coaches coming this is so funny what day does it start again today oh my God I'm going to be bulk playing League alone on my stream alongside you you're thinking yard viewers you're going to be tuning into this as it's going on because it's already going to be live and me you know I like to do I like to get the work done and Ludwig's going to be hitting a little wheel to roll the new prices on bedet all week we're going to have cheap cheap Beday cheap bedet damn near free deals damn near steal steal a bedet if you find a bedet in public and you don't have one at home steal it now might be the best time to subscribe for the Falco wheel emote yo oh everyone trying actually good plug every spinning the wheel very good plug no be spinning the wheel what is that wait you got to be spinning the wheel for the swipe Falco wheel emo yeah you know when we spin the wheel we play when we do God gam the wheel there's emote for it and we're spinning the wheel was the best time love that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up big I would love okay so my plan is for you guys to somehow lose most of your games and I somehow win most of my games and I Skyrocket past you buddy during League week you started above me I know you fell below me I threw a lot of games it will never change really I oo we are both climbing but I'm working harder I don't know if you are you think you're working harder than me I think you're working pretty hard I think you're busting out solo cues more but I don't think it says working as hard I think put more time in but I think it's bad time sometimes sometimes it is bad time but I do I do my D diligence afterwards as well my after care have you done V riew of course on stream of course no on stream Where where on stream it gets Nery where is Nick at in the nasty SE I'm not climbing at all I am getting better but I'm not climbing are you ranked Nick's just got to go he just got to wait are you ranked now rank check I'm like iron two or three dude okay so Nick uh I'm bronze four what are you silver for look at us baby you were [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] gold we be a damn peanut pot Nick will go into the boys Discord and like talk about league and just Express like here's the things I'm struggling with just talk about how he's feeling about the game and everyone like he's like our little experiment he's like our little frog and we're like tearing little pieces is that all of them disagree with each other yeah this is the problem this is why I don't think you should listen to people's advice I think it sucks cuz everyone loves to say dumb [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like guy who grows hard people like to say dumb [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like yo play Zach you'll just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] win that's not what we're saying people do say [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that people say dumb [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like yeah just get like 7 CS a minute and you'll win I've noticed that the advice as ranks get really high becomes all the same yeah and I've listened to that advice the low advice I've taken into account and I've heard heard but I don't make gospel because they're all disagreeing with each other yeah yeah well Josh is like not a low rank Josh is pretty good I think he's like a more mid-range guy well Josh has agreed pretty closely with most everything I've heard from Yes uh but he also tends to like be like oh well I understand this side too he really does see the uh you know both sides of it and come together have you tried farming creeps under Tower yeah I think I'm pretty good at it have you grinded it yeah oh I went into uh well I I grind it in games like if I'm ever playing a matchup where I just like can't play close up I'll just purposely fall back and farm if you to training tool and then you put an opposing player in your base then all the Minions will go attack that doll and then you can just Perma Farm waves yeah I I grinded farming and training tool for quite a bit not under turret but just like no abilities last hitting right um but I my farming is the only thing I'm really good at at the moment I think I think uh yeah I do think you fall off minute 10 the big the big think oh minute 10 is where you fall off first 10 you're fire maybe in your guys's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ELO first 10 you're good not my ELO uh oh yeah and sure you're really but I think that's cuz you're getting away with [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right uh yeah but I'm like new like the players I'm kind of meant to play against at the moment limit test yeah I do I limit test like crazy you got a limit test man look at my deaths look at my deaths oh your deaths in the five stack were numerous oh my God he was limit testing you were limit you limit tested what in that one game eight times you guys are just you guys are just thrilled that I'm new at a game it's your favorite thing favorite thing ever I didn't take any pleasure in this yes you no you don't I didn't take any pleasure in playing with you either a that Blitz crank was crazy it was bad the thresh had some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nice [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to it sometimes it's rough I'm not I suck at that game my first game after playing with you guys was crazy you just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the St line yeah he he he dropped bombs I had I had 9.1 CS per minute wow Co yeah my dream I don't think I'll be able to do it during the league week hitting plat that is cuz I'm like 730 LP away that's a lot yeah it is it is it's a little too much that's heaps that's heaps so I it would require like I think uh 25 plus win differential oh easy and we're going to play about 80 to 85 games in the 100 hours you pay than that uh considering the time in between games sleeps I think I think he'll cross 100 100 games I think it's possible but I think 85 is more conservative so it's like we'd have to go what like 50 and not even I have to go like 55 and 30 how good is Connor League Conor was very good a few years ago and now is silver one dude okay Ludwick will I talked to Kelly about this he he's like it's so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] frustrating talking to lwig about League cuz he thinks because I played a long time ago I don't know anything and he's like he was fre he was like kby be gold today he he'll be like Ludwick will say some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that I don't know what I'm talking about he and he bent down he's talking to me it's just me and he's like I have forgotten more about that game than he will ever learn that's very profound I'm like that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] awesome okay with most people I would agree with you it's like Kelby was just around professional league for so long he's like I go to LCS I represent people I know what I'm talking about and he comes to me and says some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like I don't know actually I in general I think league is a game where I think I heavily side with you cuz when people take giant breaks um I mean Shake is a decent example sh's a great example Shake has put in so many games and he's a hardstuck plat the game is just so he's climbing he's not really climbing dude you're so cruel I you you take you take these evil victories hold on hold on you have to think about this relative like Shake was wasn't Shake Challenger at one point I don't years ago he was just a high mean is like when people talk about them being like diamond in like season three or four it doesn't mean they were it doesn't mean they're bad but like I do think that doesn't translate into very much now the game has changed even from the perspective of even if your knowledge and execution was 100% the same the game itself is so different it is it's like when I was playing cuz I haven't played support even when I have played a couple times in like the last like three or four years I haven't played support at all so when I booted in and I was like why the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] can't I buy the support item I have no idea what's going on you didn't get like World Atlas or something right yeah yeah and then it's like and then I didn't pick it he just picked a different if you if you if you uh SP if you don't choose support it doesn't pop up any recommended I know still go get it yeah but I don't know the names of the items cuz these are all new items too none of these items even existed back that's what I mean the game is just it's so so different it's so different from something like same actually it is different when I play it you know shake is in the top six Shake has a game that's in the top 600 most damage ever dealt in na yeah that's kind of crazy that mean so like there's a website that tracks like all games like stats so he has a game that's in the top 600 of most damage dealt in the game both a champion all both team any one Champion he's personally yeah he personally how much damage uh I wonder if it says yeah shake drops dick but you you sit here and berate him like is in Platinum yeah I know he drops big Nast why that's why I think you're 143k he's been gold he's been in gold in plat for the last four seasons it doesn't mean Shake's not good I respect Shake drizzle and you guys don't and I respect Shake drizzle it's just just shake drizzle used to be a name that you would say that would Shake fear into people's boots and then he became like all might and now he plays now from my hero academ can you his poor teammates are asking him Shake how come you're down here with us you know when you shake it a drizzles right look all might that is such a better version of so that's this is Shake drizzle and then look up all might big all might big that's old Shake RZ drizzle get me he used to have it like that I think he should bring the Lee in back low key then he boots you had of jungle when they play well we'll see how your league week goes as as many as as much as the opponents the audience likes to think that we're pitted against each other I'm not think about that cuz I look at is op.gg and I see a big Green carpet and I'm like let's go dude so many people scour that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that makes me feel good oh you ever show up to your own op.gg and you don't even have to click update cuz someone else updated it for you e it was this happened this week I was in a meeting with some other people in the evening and and in the meeting in the meeting Kelby Kelby mid meeting is like wait a second guys and then everybody's like what what's wrong and he's like it's bad and we were like what the Kelby what are you talking about we're in the middle of something important right now he's like he's lost the last three games in a row and and then I go to to YouTube and I'm like L's not live and I was like Kelby are you refreshing op. while we're in this meeting he is so many people do this and I'm not just talking about like viewers I'm talking about people in my life Kelby does thise does this does this I thought you were in a meeting cuz when you're my client and it says in game which is bugged but I thought you were and I messaged you and you were like sorry I'm in a u I'm in a meeting and I said oo Nasty Gal cuz I thought he was in a meeting playing League which he wasn't I was a bug or something is that why I saw that when I logged in to play with you guys that night you had left the office and then like 10 15 minutes later I got on the computer and I was like in game did you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] drive like MKBHD home how did you get in game already I've never I've never what what's that fucker's name SBF yeah I've never played league in a meeting is that what he said that's what he did oh famously he was in league and he was hard stuck bronze after a thousand games so I can take
