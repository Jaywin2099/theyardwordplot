 it allows you to be more loose and be yourself no sorry you're okay I think first you've been debated just just because some of the off the hood oh you want this it's getting further it's getting further oh there's your straw guess you got to bend over and pick it let me see it guess you got to [Music] O we're we're going get your mic in front of your head Come on talk to the hand the bald's not listening the the panda neck tattoo looks so sick we're going yeah we've been we've been going going and you don't care all right because you're a new bald man I get it we you get you get it I get it what do you get I get the Swagger of bald can you explain what oh oh you get it there's bit of Aura okay cuz I don't care how it look anymore is that it I don't give a freak yeah I look freaking ugly as hell right okay do you think that so when I walk into a room now it's all about commanding power without my looks oh wow he's actually kind of spitting and it's not because of a bald thing but I've always held this idea that I take pictures of myself and I'll look as ugly as possible and it makes it that much more impressive when like a girl likes me is that what you're feeling I walked into a coffee shop and I stood in line what were you wearing I was wearing something similar similar I was I was wearing I was wearing a tank top with the Sea Dog VA merch pajamas which have monkeys grabbing bananas and it's baby blue and Lakers CR all over are they all over oh they're repeating yeah repeating of course you remember when you remember when just quick aside when L was like can't wear cream and white together he did he did he was wearing Lakers Lakers Crocs baby blue pajama pants with monkeys on them with monkeys with covered in monkeys and that tank top furry please furry we are not restricted to color coordination I see us three I you don't get it us three three s especially the woman over here I'm I'm I'm really sorry about that in a society in this if this was a society would I be your king or would I be the slave there's three of us and you would be you think what happen what power do you command there are ALS there are always less Kings and citizens yeah you are helping my AR this go well this goes back to the old riddle you know there's a goes back to the old riddle the old riddle to hear the old I would love sorry you tell tell the old riddle how they said it there's a mercenary in the middle of a room uh in front of him is a priest a rich man and a king and uh the question is who does who has the power over the mercenary who's the second one the priest the priest a rich man and a king um and who it's a trick the mercenary holds all the power that's right [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and you have two aimo weapons oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the mercenary holds the power even when you know it's fake when a gun is pulled on you it's not I don't like it it's not a fun experience so now what right well for okay so now you're sucking my penis what you use your power for uh the mercenary would be like okay rich man you're sucking it you're stroking the just understand this in your analogy I am the king I just don't have power you're not the king you're one of these three guys you're probably a priest he could be I'm the priest worst case 33% he's the king sh yeah I mean a rich man I think was the best idea here cuz that's still useful to the king but it's all series you know levels of control anyway uh yeah you would be I am a king with magic and I activate force field [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dude they're bouncing off by force field you know what's funny I put that in my my waistband as I was like I'll pull this out eventually and you guys gave me the perfect setup I think if you were to chart a graph of uh if all of us had a prop gun and needed an opportune time to pull it out for comedy I I I feel like yours comes out first in every timeline yeah you're the Michael Scot of this I don't think you could the experiment where they give kids a marshmallow and they say if you don't eat your marshmallow you can have two later but if you eat it now you get it now and and like I eat it so fast and there's a measurement of like all sorts of genetics and wealth what chooses what kid you are just eating the marsh I eat the marshmallow instantly other kids marshmallows I find other marshmallows to eat holding the other kids at gunpoint and stealing their marshmallow that's and that's what we should be doing he's the mercenary wait two marshmallows in front of Aiden what is this the yard podcast okay is he back is he back does he know look I feel I feel simultaneously weak and Powerful around you guys do you feel weaker or more powerful with him beside you should feel the weakest I think uh I'm riding the fence really it's it's funny CU I was trying to do the math last night when I was driving home after shaving his head bald to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and whose head yours right yeah I was there you were there it was your head and I was like if I if I shave my head to tonight or no no if I don't shave my head do I have more hair than him technically and is it the first time in human history where I have more hair than Ludwick well no and the 50 years before I was born that's crazy you're you're 30 and once again you're 30 and I'm 34 29 buddy also you know what go dead ass at Pat's house you had the most [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up blue lives matter haircut I think I had more hair than you at that time I really do uh yeah that was a very high and tight it was like the one you meme that you facea but it was real that was Pat's house I still remember that haircut when I met thinking about blue lives matter okay really yeah I think the flag's all wrong why cuz they do the line yeah yeah but the line's just random what why the line it's not it's it's it calls back to a phrase called The Thin Blue Line which implies that without The Thin Blue Line of police officers society would societ would collapse yeah but what it means the3 you didn't know that now you look stupid the 13 lines are the 13 colonies yeah so it's just like yeah is the line just New Hampshire Delaware and then they're like no it's a Thin Blue Line and there's already blue in the flag the place of the 14th colony right well one of the stars is also a skull one they do that no that TI 50 skulls that's what it could have been it could one each we could make the dopest Flag Ever we could make a million dollar we can do all right all the stars are Punisher uh skulls and it's all gray scale except for the blue Behind The Punisher logo you keep the blue 50 Punisher skulls in one Maple Leaf cuz we've taken them yeah a Punisher skull Maple Leaf combo it's a skull shaped like a leaf and then at the bottom at the bottom of the flag a silhouette of a man with a gun and just a dog cowering a cowering Chihuahua yeah yeah and then it says plus one and then it's holographic so the Chihuahua Shivers each each line on the Flag represents 1 million dogs that the police have killed and it's like the old Chief's logo hey you can make this let's start talking about my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] people like that what people I don't know I feel like kind of looking like fitting in with them today oh my God what are you talking about like since I'm B I'm kind of also this flag we can make entirely in the Halo 3 uh Banner maker yeah yeah it's impossible I promise oh by the way so I'm in this coffee line wearing pajamas looking good looking good and I spot Nick who has the most hair in this room he does he you and you have more hair than ever actually more than ever and anyway I see him and I just start looking at him MH and I'm looking at him and I'm there and he's not noticing me and he's looking past me he's like he's like you're invisible like if if you're me he's going that's awesome and it takes him until he's about to leave to recognize me for real and he all happened I didn't want to spoil it it's all happened W and then he walks up for real and he goes you look bad and that's the first words he says to me I will say I was I was going to say it loud enough for people to hear and then I instead I got close and whispered it to him why cuz I would have done the first thing immediately because I know they know I know they know too which is the power you have with ball let me touch it let me touch it is it the power yes I I do think it's power I do think it's power cuz I walked in that place and I made it my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cuz I walked out instantly do you think I do that yeah I do really I do think you think I do that to when he walks into the Jimmy John's and he orders and then he looks to his right and whoever with him is his wife that is that's his I think when when yep exact that's exactly what I was thinking is when you turn a aid and you go this is my wife she want she also wants a beach club on I installed the chip in her yesterday she Quakes like crazy I think when you do that she has a chip in her [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Diet Coke please now Coke if you were more uh like visually presentable you wouldn't do that a crazy thing to call how can I phrase it how can IAS it better how can I phrase it better I can't I if you if you were like less to repulse like you can I not say this uh I have less hair than you but you're going to keep you're going to grow it you you're a tourist let meist the one big difference between you and him right now is that once you can grow a beard like that it changes everything it does you think so it Chang yeah Chang it changes everything cuz if he goes upside down it looks you go you go from racist skin head to Brooklyn Rider like the beard the beard it's it's a toothpick it's the toothpick changes everything for bald people you know I've looked it closely at that picture it's more than the toothpick no it's not it's he like got a haircut you get you get past you get past that to at some point you go well the toothpick inside of the confidence like like like that's how he was able to go out and make changes in his life it's kind of like you know if you're if if you like if you if you've been on house for a while and you haven't showered and you haven't it's harder to get your job again right than someone who it's the same the toothpick the toothpick is the the affluence it's the and that's the beard of the bald it's the beard of the bald what if you're unable to to build a beard of a bald if you're if you're like him right here guilty then you have to rely on looking like the guy from prison break yeah you really do have to just have an chiseled face you just have to I was thinking about this it's like no one tells no one says Jason saam is ugly M no he well okay th this is funny because this gets brought up a lot in the bald like uh tunnel hole you go into and you start losing your hair go on all these forums I've been Googling stuff you you remember when Hank Green was like you know the you know the thing right the first time you Google it it's like I have a friend who's balding what should he do and they say welcome brother your phone shuts off and you get a new jailbroken display for bald yeah it's bald welcome to you get bald Uber um so a lot of these forums and things will be like dude it's okay you're going to be fine look at these guys and it's literally three people it's like Bruce Willis Jason STM and Prison Break guy Bruce Willis is my mom's celebrity crush that's before the I already kind of knew that I don't know why why would you oh my man okay excuse yuck yuck oh my God sorry this is related I was I I went to a a little art show yesterday with my lovely girlfriend who did I run into I ran into Aiden's girlfriend but I didn't just her just her but I didn't well like like not just her but Aiden wasn't there right she was not alone she was with her dad that we had just we had just publicly balded yeah and now you have pictures of on your phone and I have pictures pictures of on your phone see that wasn't weird to him you told him but we did but he was like Hey look no way and I'm like there it is Sir also I'm very sorry for dude he's been sending the first five minutes of the last episode to like everybody they know like all their friends sick so that part where I was talking about her mom yeah yeah yeah no I was so I hung out I hung out with them the next day and we're we're in uh we're in my place just me zipper 3 and her parents and then they started talking about this and he and he was like it's all good it's like I'm balding she's hot it was great yes he's got how does she feel about it he's got a great attitude she thought it was funny too for what I can tell when you're a bald dude and you have like a hot girlfriend it's you just feel like you're like stand you're like a a child on the shoulders of a tall man it's his wife huh it's his wife well I'm saying in general you know it might not be permanent what he's saying like we don't know oh man and there's also an appreciation I feel like every time in my life of out kicked my coverage it feels good I feel how you feel now what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we're the same not the same it was funny on your on about your outfit at the coffee shop he came in and he was like you will not believe his outfit when he comes in and then you actually change your pants I felt betrayed when you came Chang but the thing is I told you Nick listen to me but if you're willing to go out there looking like that why not come in here looking like that cuz my clothes are here by the will the reason is cuz I I wanted to to wear the this pants how do you have no clothes at I don't believe you have no clothes at home they're wet when cutie leaves your life crumbles I eat pancakes I go balls you don't have any clothes I go live yeah and you just and you just do marathon straight is halfway through the corpse of dur just chewing on cheating good wait you have the pets no no no okay I was going to say uh no I it was cuz I had Yingling bring me the clothes yeah his clothes are in two duffel bags it looks like money in a heist film it's so funny it's just pants Shunk Duke vitro shirt I think the way you dress started making a lot more sense to me when I realized that you just kind of take clothes from places instead of dressing like a normal person at home I wear it so for you guys if it were up to me I wouldn't had yard shirt on dude that actually makes feel like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cuz two days ago you were streaming from the office and you had a yard shirt on I was like oh and I realized now he just didn't have any give me some credit so that was a 50-50 coin flip okay cuz it was the yard shirt or a blank white T-shirt and I went I'll go with a yard shirt you get a little crazy today so I thought about that it was a 50/50 there dude I'm so I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] beefing with F foosley that that godamn say it bro don't say it we're in a safe space say we're in a safe space she won't listen to this we were we we're shaving his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] head and she I I come in with the the those materials and cuz her and M Young have been like cutting the middle of his head cuts of the chase cuz they're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] inept because she's been doing Foo cuts for 6 years and has like intentionally willingly or unintentionally stayed bad no can I just say I was watching last night and before any of this like maybe like like two weeks ago I was like okay I'm getting I'm getting really sick of the whole I'm growing my hair out thing I don't I think I want to cut it now and I thought about her show I was like maybe she would want to cut it like cuz she has a show and she's cutting hair and my perception of Foo Cuts up to this point was she like maybe used to work in a salon and then like she became a streamer and now she's like oh I'm good at cutting hair I should use that on stream I she knows nothing no she knows nothing she knows literally nothing so so and here's the thing she's this is what makes I I don't think I don't think she knows math not even a little bit I she was doing some mental addition and and I as I asked what her SAT score was she said 720 I'm calling C 720 call out of 800 that's phenomenal maybe that was the the date just the was the she took the test I don't think that was her score 720 yeah was July 20th a summer tester yeah my ass okay well anyway she uh apparently this is like a widespread thought cuz she only does f call her that oh my God I was going to say that damn it h typ racer I know you lose because she only does f cut through inbound what she's getting enough inbound requests from people she has a Client List yes she doesn't need to outbound reach out and she's getting like aess clientele like she did shroud she nice Swig asked her I think has great hair yeah I watched a little bit of the Shroud I was the only one I've seen in the Shroud one and he was like she was like do you like it be honest and he's like I'll be real it was better before the haircut so the her best one ever is when she did it with me the first time what do wait what do you measure this by by the way the hair looked after got it okay okay and and it's because I let her do nothing every time she would do something I'd be like nope that's not how that works that's how that works yeah you need a guard right now and it's like okay this is a scissor part scissor so she's just she's just going for it every time she does this I really like Nick I thought it was like she used to cut hair why do in inbounding I think it's because they have this perception based off The Branding the name the status of the there's no reason a Rand a person would randomly cut your hair you would assume they have done it before no one do sandwich doing this and she actually cut she was actually real Jeff Whit actually a real cut hair for sure for real he's a barber shop so but so there's like a genre of Creator who used to cut hair who cut hair now and so you would think is she Ling or is it a big prank she's a terrorist yes she's a terrorist in her her act of terrorism is cutting hair bad uh but usually she has like guard rails it wasn't to me it wasn't that she like it wasn't that she was bad at it it was that she would go how do I use the razor yeah she didn't know her tools she know so like so anyway she's cutting my hair and she can't shave it like she's like she's too afraid to cut you she's too afraid to cut me and so she's cutting it like way up here she's going like Wing like really fast way high I'm like this is not doing it yeah I had to show up and be like no it's okay you can get closer to his skin I actually cut lwig but that was my fault but I was like it's pretty hard to do so and she and then she did it she's like oh so you weren't going to bring the big guns in and had to well I didn't know what cut she was going to do cuz I was blindfolded so but when I realized you could feel it yeah I was like okay I can tell there's nothing here the goal it was a reverse Mohawk and so I just at one point I go I call slime and he's like I'm on my way and I'm like bring the stuff and he's like okay it'll be 30 yeah I well it's funny cuz I was going to go work out saw this was happening I'm like I'm going to crash this thing and you called me out when I was in my car so I had to go back and get uh you know I'm glad did the things I use um but I use we use cuz we're both bald all three of us that's right all three of us we're all Bal all three of us bald 30y old just I'm so far from where you guys are at far not far you're much closer how far is a centimeter oh we already named that it's a good question we already figured that out it's a distance it's meas let's imagine one person is a unic and let's imagine the other has a 1 cmet penis yeah that you're closer to being P than you are to Peter nor it's very similar practically we do the same things with it you know Peter North called this penis the North Pole that's funny that's pretty good uh so I walk in and she looks at me and she like L's like okay the expert's here and she's like why is he the expert oh she's like I never even thought of you as bald which is an awesome thing to hear crazy cuz she said on the NAT because she said on the same stream she was she was talking you guys are talking about shaving my head and she was like oh no Nick has nice hair she remembers my hair but when there's just no hair to look at it's it's like baby it's like I didn't see anything it's like white is not a color it is merely the absence of color um and so but it was look at us right bro was shut up lwig it was so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up cuz after I like work out uh lwig M and FY go upstairs and they're like talking and hanging out I go up to like grab a a protein bar and say goodbye and so I'm like bye guys it's nice hanging out I'm leaving they're like bye okay I'm walking out the door well just real quick preface he doesn't say goodbye guys see you later he goes and grabs the protein bar comes up to my face puts it on my face he goes protein I need protein I need to get big with protein do you see how it's different it was funny he was sitting down and I was at like standing height your penis height like a penis height and I just started like caressing his cheek with it like near my penis is FY watching they're both just watching they thought it was really funny and uh and and I was like and I was like it's funny how when he phrases it he goes yeah so I just said goodbye said goodbye I was going to say goodbye I gave hugs all around there was like a PE sign I think and then walked out the door and I was just like and I was like there's no Pro protein shakes and need protein and uh right and then he kind of like he kind of like took it okay move on so you're walking out like he didn't say he didn't say don't do that don't you know how he does that sometimes he'd been here before maybe it made me look like it made me look like I secretly run your life which was really funny anyway what else did you experience as a bald so far just the coffee shop uh are you looks for being bald for my girl cue ain't happy yeah she tweeted a brown bag yeah oh and a Lego man yeah she did do that the Lego man and the Lego man no hat no no hat no she uh I facetimed her this morning and she's like head on okay from the side she keeps saying it looks like the letter P which I don't you kind of look like the new patreon logo your head is uh it's fine I well I have this thing right here excellent I have this thing where it's like bulgy goes in bulgy it's like the Tyler one head shape yeah it is a so if I do this it's more accentuated but he's bald and he looks good and it kind of looks a bit weird like hor skull right you got a bigger you got a bit of a bigger skull keps going horn you got horns yeah you know what I would say keep keep a a Turkish flight ready to go I just in case I'm fine I'm first off God bless you second off I'm fine it's kind of going up it's not kind of like lowkey I know you want to make this thing can't say that cuz it's just not it's just snatch it's just not I can see where the hair isn't sure and you all can too it's just snatched it just is I know snatched snat is a big word bro I don't know it is this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] A1 you see my scar too yeah what's that from I tried to do a flip into a pool this was like Tuesday this is when I was like 11 oh we both got flip scars back or front it was a front flip I used to used to hit him constantly I was not scared of flipping at all cuz my cousin showed me so I go for the flip I hit my head on the side and then I but I go in the pool and then I just like it didn't hurt but I was like a I was embarrassed so then I was just kind of swimming under the water for a bit and I just hear screams from above the water there just blood everywhere oh that guy's bleeding out of his head kid and you're staying underwat cuz you're embarrassed I think you're dead down there and my sister's freaking out my mom freaks out and then they drive to the hospital they go staple me up wow it was pretty easy as a procedure now it looks normal cracking your skull is not too big of a deal I think I think it is cracking your skull I did it not back chill crack your skull I don't you cracked your skull I think you broke the skin on top of your head yeah cracked the skull away bit I don't think that's true why do you think they staed it because the skin what if he was normal before that normal how but now that's why not normal now like no one in his family is from France yeah yeah what if that happened and he just spoke French and then everyone just kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] went along with it his family they started learning French to accom like he became deaf that's beautiful that's not what happened D I can't believe that happened to you that's that's beautiful your family is so nice I feel like that's an enriching family environment that they would all learn French that many would be jealous of Loving Family you guys still doing basketball yeah today doing it today yeah are you going to play basketball yeah how's that going what does that mean you're like do you guys want to go play with those guys and Camera whips over it's everyone's bald uh I think they I think they run that court I don't think we need to go it's going well it's getting it's getting big is the issue you don't like having people involved there's like so many people some people you wish you could cut oh no it's not about cutting but it kind of is no would put a few on The Chopping Block there's like there's like 18 to sometimes 20 plus who show up and so it means you're waiting more time in between games sometimes who would you cut let me without you having to name people I'm going ask you a philosophical would you rather cut from The Good the good players or the bad players Kelby um Kelby uh no I it wouldn't the issue the issue is not specific people the issue is that once you if we're sitting in this pocket right now where if you hit like 18 people instead of 20 or like 12 18 means you have one big regular game and a bunch of people who have to sit or can't play a full 5v5 game so you need to like be close to 10 or be past 20 I would Thanos snap don't care who goes not me yeah I was going to say you the Snapper never goes could Thanos have snapped himself that would have made him so much cool badass he's like yeah I ran that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he's like I don't know this could really do it and then he dies right there purple [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] just disappears accidentally do I was going to say while beating off his penis he could accidentally make I know like like a snapping noise snapping is just your is just your middle finger hitting like the pad of your thumb oh you're saying he could accidentally accidentally he'd have to be beating off with the glove yeah well of course which is kind of like if I'm Thanos I'm trying the glove there's no way I'm going to not try the GL cuz you can get crazy it's like going to a soda Fountain and like mixing some too like you're picking different stones and you're seeing what each one does he's doing it and throwing one stone on at a time dude he's busting in like a different dimension what your stone of power bust look like yeah I bet it would shoot through the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] concrete wall like a lightsaber uh yeah we so by we have a patreon by the way you can give us money you can you can spend money on that do there's more of that so basketball's going okay it's going F why you saying why you this is weird this is like when Nick yling was talking about when you guys do the yard on February 6th I was like what does that mean why are you making an ominous threat are you showing up today making me nervous I'm just wondering about basketball why I don't think you are I am cuz I like the idea of a social Dynamic that has gone out of control it's like a Discord where too many people came inside no it's not that bad I think it is it's not it's not I think it is do you ever sit out uh yall take like rest I'll was personally like out of games we used to have to sit we've always had to sit out of games why is that you made the the league trying to so it's weird it's very weird you made the league why would you I I think he's like trying to sew dissension because he's jealous of our social someone joins the call and you're like not this guy it's not really it's not really like there's not a so what if I join the call I you keep trying to make this play basketball that would be great I you've seen what I can do on the I would love for him to come play basketball be fine you wouldn't be the worst one no you would no you would be the worst player fine like dri he would dribble like Stanley from the office he would love it it would be awesome but that's the thing if you if you said you wanted to come and play basketball today I would be elated would be very really mean to you we don't care really yeah I always am that's like going 0 and 16 and being mean it does matter if it's like it doesn't mean anything he's foring you in friendlies who cares if you're being mean your words mean nothing yeah I really couldn't get to you no no unless you physically hurt him maybe no you can get to him you think so he's the easiest to get he's the easiest to get to yeah Aiden is getable Aiden's very Aiden someone would score on Aiden and you you would just be like uh Aiden I think no no no no no no he doesn't care about that he'd be like yeah he's a good player he's a good player you you have to be like Aiden I think you I think you traveled he's like it's not a travel that's what gets aen no I think it's like the ru it's like many other guys scored anyway yes yes calling him on a foul or challenging the fouls he calls that's how to get Aiden yeah when you like take a charge I would stop you from from doing that rock Tua save on that thing it's like it's it's think that's good un it's so old now what's old about it I won't let them P I use rocket money how much do you think

Photoshop of this years ago I on my phone it looks awful if that photoshop can I tell you I never did I tell you guys this when I was going when I was like losing my hair I photoshopped myself bald to see what I would look like how did it make you feel is it accurate well I'm not good at Photoshop this is like like in 2017 yeah this is not like using face tune and we didn't have the tools that we have now and dude oh black man's head I don't think it was on my computer so but I remember looking at it and being like it's not too B bad I think you grabbed a different person's top bald half uh no

like like what do you call it uh used like masking tool you mask your forehead all over you know how you can take a piece of a a image yeah I used the stamp tool and like made my skin more so it's like constantly repeating the same like forehead keeps moving is yeah your forehead becomes more yeah dude I just had this like really sad night where I I did that and but at the end of it I was like yeah my head shape look looks fine I guess you think if L right now while he's bald just like lathered his head in like like finasteride and minoxidil a big cocktail at all do you think it would come back like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] just like horse hair it really that's how it worked takes a long time there would not be bald people yeah that easy no I'm not saying it would create new hair I'm saying the hair that you do grow is like way stronger I think you can get you can achieve thickness with these tools you're talking about but it still takes a while his hair would be grown out already before you even saw something so if you want if you want it thick give it to yourself it actually is so it's very thick look at how many dots I have already you know did you guys also know there's a procedure to get tattooed not on your like your subdermal layer it's like the layer above so it's not permanent but it lasts for like a year and you tattoo what that looks like on your head bald guys sometimes get this too I promise I've wait is it just so your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] looks less than it looks as if you are choosing to sh it looks like you're choosing to be bald because it looks like you have hair that can come back that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's like when when um people tattoo their eyebrows right yeah similar it's it's different it's different because tattooing your eyebrows is saying look I have eyebrows but tattooing the hair follicle is saying I don't have hair right now but I could yeah and it look it looks exactly like what it's actually very realistic it's hard to um but it's funny cuz I remember this so viid cuz there was like a botched one I saw on Reddit years ago it was like a guy who was offering this service cheap and literally a dude with a tattoo gun and this guy's

where they look like a Lego man's head underneath they toad takes off the dude that would kill a toad literally cherry pie coming out of his head no it would kill a toad instantly into a billion pieces you don't know toad like I do you know toad I will say I think he spent more time with toad toad do come up toad doesn't come up Oni toad does not come up Oni all the time don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lie toad comes up toad does not come up one damn timei all the time he he comes up when people go over his face in the character select cream that's when he comes up yeah mushroom brain he tips his hat it's a mush it's a Fung he's based off fungi and you need the the the top of a fungi the cap as it's called Toadette implies uh sex to these creatures uh which implies back shots that that's such a leap it's tough how is it a leap not a leap Toad and Toadette back shots what does the woman imply Toad the problem toad doesn't have toad doesn't havep so hitting the back there's not a lot of movement in the back but like the existence of a female worm does not imply the existence of worm back shots no that's different though I think it literally does it literally doesn't sexual dimorphism is about back shots it's not always about back shots a lot and I you know what I had to go deep down the animal kingdom cuz it's a lot of them have back shot it's not always about back shot shut up dude shut up I'm not the back shot guy I'm not the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] back shot guy in this room yeah cuz you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bald now and you like Mish that's not don't yeah you're a m Lover now yes I'm the freaking same as you you're the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] same you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what does what does worm sex look like oh brother I've never seen that I think worms are the worms the one that drops sperm sex and then like the girl like throws up on it I think the beauty of worm sex is that because they're they're cylinders right any shot can be a back shot dude we need Maya on the podt actually yeah she would probably have a lot of answers D I just watch that Kur G Scott video about how the worms used to why we're allergic to stuff and it's because back in the day we used to we used to poop where in the same water that we drink and so we drink so much back we get so we get so many worms in our body from drinking water that our body got really good at killing worms and now in the future even though we don't have that problem sometimes you eat like a seafood and it it goes worm and then it starts attacking it but then there but then you don't need to attack it because you just digest it and whatever it's normal and so your body attacks you the allergy does feel like a hold over that doesn't just in our evolutionary Left Behind Some people are allergic to peanuts for instance this young woman over here is crazy oh I think it's going away really I've been testing it I've been pushing it a little further dangerous bro I don't want I don't want to hear from zipper 3 that you went to the hospital with a swollen throat if you make a vac if you make a vaccine you inject yourself first it's tradition I'm working I'm that it was in the movie I'm solving the crisis I forgot dude I bought peanut butter that's so interesting a I put in the kitchen yeah that's great awesome IED it over secret appliances and I told no one about it now we're talking we go

questions about it he's only asking specific questions I think I he's never asking like are there bad questions let's just let's Alex never heard of aam's Razer never really that's doesn't seem like the type cat or any of the fun I brought up that court case about like uh emulation or whatever he's like how do you know [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that dude and I'm like I don't know just read he just got you just got to find out about it why are you so surprised but now he's educating me on the aliens but you give him but you give him a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a trap beat give him a trap beat and he knows it's going to be I got to defend a bit here cuz you also give him an iron Manon challenge he beat that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in 16 hours that clear that wait isn't that really hard didn't it take you 50 it took me well 50 is a lie okay cuz I slept so it's more you had had to sleep you couldn't beat it before going to bed well like my stream was continuous so people are counting my hours live not my time PL more than that shouldn't be it what they they shouldn't count your sleepy time I agree but that's what everyone when they reference it references the time of my stream did you count Alex's he didn't do it straight no no one did it straight except for me Nobody Does it Like Me well they you should count his the way they count your thank you but they don't it don't so how many hours did it actually take you then you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] complainer 30 still double smaller than 50 though relative yeah true it's it's over half isn't that funny more than 50 more than 50 and so well anyway I feel bad cuz I was meaning him yesterday too what' you do bro cuz we were playing Paul I was playing pully bridge and then I went upstairs and then Nick was joking was like dude Al if Alex try to play this game and then I made that joke on stream and then Alex just pops in stream he goes what did you say you said this I was say yeah we were watching polybridge and Alex was like what's this and I was literally just like don't worry about it I was imagining him playing the game and is being like chat what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do I do yeah he's this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] boring yo dude it's like you watch to play poly Bridge you come back five minutes later and he's just watching YouTube videos monkey Alex would message me yo do you want to play polybridge on stream tonight and I'd be like sure and then I'd show up and 5 minutes in he would just watch YouTube videos and we wouldn't do it yeah he'd be like yo this this this chimp is eating a grape yeah we're going to watch that instead po Bridge does rule though what happens in that game do you just you you got to build a bridge and if it if you don't build it right it it can break and you have to bridge you have to build it so like a car can drive over it civil engineer you have a budget and you have materials and the materials are have different levels of strength and different cost different levels and sometimes a plane comes through you have to make a hydraulic bridge and other times you have to make a rope Bridge like it'll be like a plane's coming so you can't just build the bridge across the bridge has to go down now but like you have to think about like how if you go too low then you're not going to get enough an ntia it's for real freaking thinkers can't make it it's for real freaking thinkers do you guys see uh B doob's beefing with the NBA young boy baby Dooby yeah it's B doobie it's Baba Dooby baby I think why did I think you were right sometimes I'm right I've I've had a great day everyone's agreeing with me I've been right a lot and you're bald we're we're looking 30 at the moment can can we can we look this up zipper maybe an interview where she says it herself uh do you don't know about this oh oh her name I I the only my only frame of understanding is that in like the SoCal melee boys Discord cliche keeps posting that he doesn't like that people are being mean to her on Twitter and it'sing his life my bad that's yeah yeah cliche and her are connected uh spiritually um but yeah she's beefing with with young boy you hate all I'm saying is you hate to see it oh it's got I think G's right now that I think about it and I appreciate that because when I looked at her name I now think slime's right we're all jumbled up because it's B EA b a d what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do you guys want I only heard it way I actually listen to her music too that's the difference me too what's your favorite song the perfect pair thank you for asking no it's actually not that's the funny thing it's just the only song you know it's my favorite it's the only one you know my favorite does check mark mean what does the check mark mean what does check it means downloaded that's what that means that's the only one that's what that means you don't even have [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] beaches you you suck you suck she has a she has suck ass you suck I don't suck ass I don't suck ass you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] top 40 Andy and it's gross top 40 Andy I also like glue song yeah obviously glue song I'm tired of this bro I'm I'm more tapped in than you guys it's disgusting that's anyway yeah it it's don't look don't say some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you didn't even know marass eats it twice Marquez eats it twice bro you mean in sear know in a different show Marquez eats it I just saw to in out I just saw him yeah man that's all for this week I just watched that last night SPO spoiler alert if you watch seevers but uh marcass is going to spell the alphabet two different [Music] languages ah this show is so cool man the yard I love SE something happened this week is uh there's a there's I queued up I queued up Ai and I get you somebody has a teammate there's a guy in the Discord server named Yang and he's a big yard fan and we got put on the same team so he's super excited and at the beginning of the Moi he posts his Spotify wrapped and it shows that he listened to more yard than music last year wow that's I guess that makes sense CU it's you finish the art it's an hour and a half of Music work it can be a lot right if you listen to every episode you're talk I just means you like music less than you like uh like podcasts which I think is weird and and it gets weird I no I think it means I think I think it means that uh uh music and podcast are are used in the same similar times of your life you're driving you're at work I I listen to more podcast and music do you think I'm weird yeah I do oh my dude oh he looks good as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's so annoying everyone see do it this way do you that's pretty good it looks so excellent everyone doesn't like that go go to Blink 182 feeling this and go to 10 seconds and tell me that doesn't look like lwig we don't even need to pull it up do it at home tell me that doesn't look like lwig it doesn't you're wrong I'm sorry you lost this one okay what were we talking so so he on your team he got on my team we we've played together in the same lobbies before and what he'll do sometimes is like people will share clips of gameplay of like insane stuff that happens while the event is going on because you always have a break between races he shares he shares Clips a fully frame clips from OBS so he has his webcam up whenever he shares a clip he's just he looks almost exactly like you he's got beard he's totally bald and my favorite things about his Clips is he'll post something where he gets like heinously [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up for like 10 seconds but he's absolutely dead pan the whole time so I've rolled this guy as my teammate is he good uh he's like pretty pretty good yeah we're around he's probably like a little better than me but I'm tanking this event like I am on track to have literally my worst event of the entire season out of 200 events and he is having the event of a lifetime like he is hard carrying me and it is super super hard to do that and uh and I'm like 10 I think we're like eight or 10 races in out of the 12 and he's on he he's at we're at eight races and he's already broken a 100 points which is amazing because if you break a 100 by the end of 12 that's amazing and I have like less than I have like 15 points which is so bad which is like the amount of points that you'd hope to have after like maybe two races one or two races and he's posting like you know he's just excited and like encouraging me the whole time like he's just pumped that we're playing and he's like yeah yeah it's going to get bigger I'm just like apologizing and he does so well that we win the event still which is in this format is like almost impossible to do and I'm telling my friends I'm like I'm getting carried by a yard fan who like listens to the show more than music like this is why this is this is the worst case scenario for why he showed up he locked in well it's crazy he showed up right because you would You' imagine he suum to nerves there yeah you you enter me in the Genesis and Sydney Sweeney is my teammate I'm give me mang I'm locking in give me mango lock it in you're Sydney [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Sweeny he wants to bounce on it he carried he carried so hard I felt so bad that I I sent him merch after wow using your exective powers I I cuz this is off the back this is off the back of like I'm on a mega down streak where I've only I've lost like the past like 10 or 15 events before this and he did everything in his power to like break the streak basically for me and I'm like this guy deserves at least like a free hat or something what do you get for winning an event um some points you get like MMR it's like yeah you go up and down and nor I I've been tanking do you get equal points yes yeah that's sick so I Sur Sur that MMR is a doubles MMR or like a two it's not like a is that your solo M my solo q that is crazy it works that way it's not like rocket League yeah so I went up that's sick I went up and he saved me yeah you you're basically it's so funny you're a Discord kitten I I was Discord kitten bald yard fan saved his Discord K you have to ask your fan to to boost you it's like you're like over his shoulder and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like like D-Day and Normandy and he's just carrying you oh man I asked Northern lion if he knows the people in the yard podcast and one of you is going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yourself you're going to have to figure out a problem a solution for that problem because one of you has been hurt here well it should be me cuz I'm not wearing meundies at the moment so it's better to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] them I'd rather [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] my normal underwear than the great meundies that's a good call well unfortunately for you he didn't know you were on the pot he said you me slime Aiden and one other man what are you wearing right now what are you wearing right now you well I've just I've just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a pair of just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] normal name brand boxers God it's not me undies yuck but now I need new underwear that maybe I don't know handles the problem a little bit better well let's ask someone who Northern lion knows to do this read Because that'll appeal to more people broadly Aiden well I I think besides the underwear you might be able to put on even a few things like uh some joggers some hoodies some onesies anything you might have [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on during [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] went up my back Aiden all your shirt yeah it's all over the back of my Batman shirt Nick that's disgusting that's disgusting and they come in extra small for you I think the thing about it is I think Nick he's worried when he shits his pants

cuz like if Aiden's playing really well was the dream for the animals that would get into your league games when you were on your climb was it the dream for them they wer carrying him though no one carried me in any you didn't get carried a single time not once that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] real it's just me batting a thousand mhm dude you can't even lie your stats were prettyy SI my stats were out of 444 KDA dude you still carried a couple on my final on my final push in valorant that's it felt it felt good cuz I looked at like my final day of games to to Immortal and I'm like I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] doing well 38 and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 20 bro I'm that fella I am that fella with a with a and even when I'm not playing well you know I'll turn it around cuz I'm hitting that R button at the right time I'm a God at League you don't got to talk to me like that ever again you're plat you were plat huh you were plat it doesn't work it worked on Leslie and meong yeah cuz after I went bald if I started to do this at them they would Flinch yeah were you doing that before you were bald uh no no it kind of just felt I felt right it felt right when I became like when cuz they walking outside to their Uber and I was walking in my car and then I was like right and they were scared and they were scared and running yeah it was dark and freaking that was fun what okay what if they made maybe like what if they made like an Among Us mod and except and not you're not in the ship you're in Lumen yo and you're roaming the halls of L you got you got to you got to do numbers like like Mar s you got to drag numbers into the box like Mar s and you got to eat the box like Mar s you got to eat the Box you got you got eat it twice uh it's among us but when you're in the impostor no you eat the box and that's how the kill animation goes it's just you eating the Box it pops up yeah yeah yeah it puts you under two Among Us characters eating each other out really slow yeah are we intense you know that that I think you should leave sketch where he's feeding the egg on his computer that's what they do it Lumin all day that's that's what Among Us is didn't I say that exact same sentence I think I said that I think I said the exact same thing dude can you touch this it's growing back so fast shut up bro actually I haven't touched it yet yeah Against the Grain not you you got a good not IOU not you I want to touch come gotouch come on got it got e the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is that see how they treat us I like how they treat us what do you mean e it was like you know it was like it's just you should feel it off the off I think I've done it comes I've come out of the shower he's at my house and I say touch my head now it's very jarring for people like me and Nick to see and feel think ni have a hard time people tall people what is the category you guys are both in yeah I think there's a way that we're clearly I can't think of one thing to group you two into I literally can't it's actually really hard I guess yard podcast members but we're you both have ends in your first name there we go that's what it is a weird grouping I would say I guess we got there you also have one though oh tough eyes you guys got eyes SL SL oh man man the other when when he got uh shaved I was on the couch and I before before anyone said it on stream before people were tweeting at me I I said out loud I was like I'm the last haired member because I literally forgot he has hair I just I just remember I think of him as bald now and and you know it's funny cuz some people will think of you only as bald and some people will think of you as anything but bald and Leslie amazingly did both in one night and that was the what's the other guy haishi heihachi HEI you heihachi when my original haircut cuz the idea was I went blindfolded I let fosy cut my hair however she wanted and she cut me like AI oh that guy's from Tekken it's funny we were doing 20 questions and you were like is he from before 2000 and weirdly enough yeah cuz that's how old Tekken is so he like from 1995 getting there yeah it also looks like Swampert and that was a really good one to find out I can't wait to see your numbers bro what a study what a stud you know what bro you should do like an NL like uh spoof stream sare camera wear glasses wear glasses and I it's going to be weird do you think that do you think will go down oh our viewership there's look there are a nonzero amount of people that watch cuz lck's handsome and they're not listening right now we can say whatever they want you're you're all schizophrenic and I got to compensate what oh what I thought I was trying to I don't think why you laughing guess I got to comp I guess I guess guess I got to compensate it's the way you're saying the word compensate what it's defin the I have to I why it's when you laugh it feels bad how's he saying it guess I got to conf and say and then you do like a love thing I guess I got to compensate wait he looks good right now I I think he looks he's compensated what going to be some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] freak's Twitter picture now he's smoldering [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah that rules dude well I did my YouTuber stream yesterday yeah I saw and there was a comment was like I saw your cat girl this is genuinely the first live stream I've ever watched of his and I was like that sucks that is nuts dude there was a post of your subredit I was like is it weird that I just like lwig vtuber more than like him as you know on camera and I'm like you're just it's just that's what you want you it's not weird but it's funny that's what it took for you to realiz like C boys yeah I think it's weird I don't think liking vtubers is weird I think if you have a streamer and then they be come like like lwig and they and he do a vtuber stream you're like I prefer it I think it is inherently weird I also you know what absolutely disagree why what is this the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] train interview show you mean 100% disagree 100% disagree why 100% disagree uh cuz you can enjoy how so cuz I think when people are under vtuber mask they act different and you can the real them are they the real them or they fake them uh I think they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up is the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up I do think they're they're more loose they're more loose I I think this is you're reading into this too much it's merely a roar Shack people who like vtubers like to see a a reduced character that they can easily connect with it's like looking at a smiley face a human being genuinely genuinely I almost just said it cuz that was so dumb how is it dumb I feel like it's not dumb even if disagree basically just said a vtuber is a smiley face emoji that's what you said it's closer to a smiley face so it's easier for the person to connect this is crazy corre this is crazy this is crazy okay this am I the only one if you are looking at a vtuber and let's say you're looking at a human being I have a lot of differences with that human being you know what you just said people like Texas cuz it's the closest to a Dorito shape I bet you I bet you there is someone who is like that or it kind of looks like a cowboy hat no no one likes Texas uh i i v tubing V tubing okay when you see when there's a flesh when there's a fleshy who triesh when there's a flesh tuber who tries V tubing they usually if they do it enough act different in the vtuber world because they feel more loose cuz they're not on camera it's like that one uh Tekken streamer who said the nword a bunch it's like that it's probably like that I feel like that happens a lot with vtubers I why do you feel that name one after school selfie who's that that was the person that did that is a Tekken streamer yeah named two I can't it only takes one uh I I think I think you I've done this I've done like no FaceCam streams and when I do no FaceCam streams sometimes people are like oh dude why are you funnier today really yeah cuz you can be a little zanier you can like I'm thinking less about cuz like sometimes when I'm flesh tubing you're saying you're saying your you're saying your mental stack is is shrunk cuz you left to think so you're able to be you can release your inhibition I think that's you should you should not call it I don't want to hear about your flesh tube I'm flesh tubing I mean I have a flesh tube for a r that was already kind of the joke he made and he just made it really CR he made it way more you made it real fucku heard I you really think I'm that wrong [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] c% because I think the people that frequent vtubers are a certain type of people and they are exactly Tempo thing in 2025 you don't think there's something to be said about what what what he's saying that like the it's like simpli simplification of emotion through you give this man way much to interact with slime got too much slime the terrorist much is running back the sauno bit in 2025 and you guys have been trying to go in on vtubers as if it's AI you're just trying to bet on the next big thing but it hasn't happened no I'm say GA culturally culturally this is like when Windows made a tablet based operating system cuz tablets are going to be big slime is so out of touch he's such a boomer that he thinks that the people who watch YouTubers are 40-year-old incels who are jerking their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to anime girls every day can be any age and that's beautiful but that's what you think maybe 40 is not the right answer and that and that and so you think and you think they're just lower IQ people because they don't watch fleshies lower IQ I do I do see them as weirder than me yes yes you see them as lower than see I don't I don't I don't feel that way I don't I don't think they're weirder than me how do you feel I like okay why people like FES cuz they're hot yeah your answer no yeah you look at like a big awesome wolf with huge balls you want to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that to me there's like suck balls to me like there's like champagne for you know how like some people will be like Sonic Fox's outfit isn't even that it's not like that's a cheap fur suit and the real heads are like like that's not even like a nice suit sure see there's like there's like uh what's it called there's like hierarchy in that world of like who's a real one I I feel like there's probably a similar thing with v tubing where it's like when you just put on the vtube thing for one stream it's like that's not a vtuber you're not a real you're not a real vtuber head and so to me it's like it's like a it's a world like like a furry world it's like you have you have you have an identity that's in this imaginary plane and you get to you get to watch someone who's in that same world as you not that the fan is also a YouTuber but that it just feels like it's it's almost like a version of roleplay he just changed my mind dude it is I by contextualizing V tubing through fures mind F I think f is I I personally don't love that comparison why why cuz I think furry has a seual sexual connotation not always I think I think there's a big part of the but isn't that the whole thing is like the the the core like regardless of the sexuality or not the core idea behind being a furry is that it gives you this window into being more comfortable with yourself and personality and identity it seems like your argument for V tuing was the same no no no no no no my it allows you to be more loose and be yourself no sorry you're okay I think first de just because some of the off the hood just because some of the fur's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hotel rooms doesn't mean that the underlying thesis is not the same the difference is can we not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hotel rooms anymore are we are we are we not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Gentlemen please F AAL speaking you can [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hotel me and fur's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in hotel the F the fur the furry difference is that they're not doing it generally for an audience yeah they're not streaming there's not a big subsection of streaming fures I'm sure there are some but it's they're not popular I think hold on but I think the only I continue the only reason that that's the case I have I have a quick question that I think please interrupt I will and I and I will is don't you think think if people had the ability to present as V fin that's what I'd start with if people had the ability to present as vtubers in public as they do in their furry costume don't you think a lot of these people would also do that I I think you're missing the point I think furry culture I think it's kind of like that's a good call sorry cut cutting you off what I'm sorry is it is it cut you off go ahead terrorists whoa I think look I think you know how with melee it's like but before you could play online it's like less people we're playing cuz it's like the layers of friction you need to get a physical device and object in the room like a CRT and a console but now you can play slippy way more people furry is kind of similar V2 it's all on the computer It's All Digital you can get your V2 model made and you can just and you just need a webcam an identity fantasy but the furry that's a that's a costume that's a thing it's a physical item you have to wear now you have to hear your through your mic you have to mic the inside of your helmet I was going to say it's about micing it's actually that's I think I think it's the physicality of what it takes to to stream as a as a as a furry versus a YouTuber well I think furries exist in a digital space it's usually just in VR chat so it it exists but it's just not a it's just generally not a medium that's made for other people it's made for like yourself to be a part of this community okay it's very is explicitly a broadcast yes I that's a good so I think the comparison for me for V tubing is it's like WWE they are cuz they are characters who exist and and are born through their debut stream and they don't exist prior to this you don't know the person behind the vtuber you never do in real vtuber world that makes sense so they're so they're they're brought on usually in part of a group very similar to WWE right whether it's Hall alive or or V show wasn't your aru I guess I guess it's weird because a lot of from my understanding a lot of V tubing has been like commodified or is like supported by large companies behind it now but from what you were saying you were saying that V tubing allows the person to be more them and be more expressive so isn't that antithetical to what you're saying now no I I think that's just an aside point I'm saying the the first thing okay that it being like WWE is explaining why the fans aren't weird to slime okay the the you can express yourself more is me explaining why like there's some advantages to a vtuber stream versus a flesh tuber stream like I think like why could be a more entertaining product as well it Counterpoint uhhuh flesh tube V tube right that's gross not bad it's like a penis in a vagina right it makes you think it the AIO Len you need both to make a baby tube to to do back shots lwig you need the Flash 2 and the V2 it's a sexual dimorphism just like apes just like apes in conclusion I think slime is a boomer and doesn't understand why people would enjoy vtubers and I don't think you would get there even if you were exposed to maybe some of its high points CFG and sometimes he uses dampe vtuber I get it what if it was a that is so different how he doesn't use a face cam it's closer to your argument because it's an indie vtuber and it's not the same it's not the and not not a24 ass V tubing Indie V tubing is that more akin to being a furry I'm saying own pulls up his Dragon to play on camera [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] my God he strugging it he has a dragon vtuber when he pulls it up to play a game cuz he doesn't want to be on Facecam like that's fine there's nothing wrong with that but you're not really tapping into what people love about V tubing which is like the culture of it which is the debut streams which is like the making the co Solo Songs the concerts and then the retirement eventually where they never stream ever again I conc that you know way more about this than I do and and that you're making really good points when does he ever said that what is the it's CU I'm bald now me he just I come here twin what you just okay I got what you just described is like damn I didn't know all that and it actually makes a lot of sense and it's what if it was what okay imagine if V tuber and the it's just a monkey it's like a photo realistic looking monkey I'm there what kind of monkey what kind of monkey though what kind of monkey is it like an ape or a monkey Apes don't have tails I'll say it's like an ape it's like an ape like a chimp or like a gorilla uh gorilla's a little too like like a chimp like a chimp like a chimp and and uh and every time and and and the chimp is just playing like valerant and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] just playing video gam but but but whenever he like dies he just starts screaming like an ape and and eating only bananas but it's but there's all sorts of awesome lore like where he was born and and what how we found like a computer and built it and then one day like would you be into that would you watch the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of that no I don't think so I think funny I think if can the chip like speak English and like make jokes it's exactly what you want yes the answer is yes if you like that I I mean I think I'd just rather watch a human being I think that's and then just watch a chimp too yeah I'd like I I'd rather watch a chimp on YouTube like eating food and then watch like a human stream I don't need a marriage of these things I think you're probably right cuz there was a very like or somewhat big vtuber who did just a Sheba enu similar to you're saying but it was like like it was uncanny valley for both it's like there not might I should give a webcam to like all the animals like in their little respective rooms and cages and stuff and then just put get hire streamers to come play video games but the webcam is the animal and it's like they're playing and she should have like a hundred different streams live all at the same time it's like it's like oh my you guys see the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the rare donkey that's almost extinct hit like a 4K yeah do you think she has rare donkey it's a rare donkey she must sctu yeah it's a sanctuary if it's not there where is it it's got two of every animal she has a blue donkey so they can hit back shot yeah and she's currently building the ark right now Himalayan blue donkey is about to die how do you know she doesn't is what I I would ask immediately been there okay you looked at every animal yes oh you looked at every animal it's a big Sanctuary I looked at every animal you the whole thing I guess you want the whole cuz the rare donkeys are in the place of the pyramid that the Taurus can go right okay all right Mr Beast here's the rare valuable last two donkeys on Earth come take a look yeah oh just look at them in in range of killing them we'd like we'd let you do that yeah you you're saying how dangerous you are if you sneeze in front of one oh my God you g it co probably you know what when I went into the the bird cage I had to clean my shoes yeah yeah you have to do that the Gibbon Sanctuary too to clean my shoes so I wouldn't infect them yeah and when you buy eggs what needs to be on the package to make sure the chickens were treated properly trick question it's not one it's just a regular question who got me what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you talking about what does it say on the package with the eggs it says uh cage free no hand were harmed in the making of This egg no both it says air on it yes correct certified Humane certified Humane certified Humane yes by whom certified Humane by the uh I don't know some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] group that does it is it a group or is it a government agency it's a group okay it might be like Humane Society is that the anal overs or tell stop asking me question doesn't matter now you matter now I'm just saying what if it say cage free if it say open range all that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's malarky can I still get that bird flu if it's Humane you can uh you can get it presumably not they wouldn't sell it I'm saying I could I could brand the top of your penis area with certified Humane yeah and just make up an agency you can't you from the agency you can't say what this is this group you don't know their structure government agency they're really profound and good you don't know we we give Aiden a surgery and we make it so he can lay eggs that' be awesome and then we start selling his EG EG baby humanized eggs or slightly bigger than bird like if you got one in the store you'd be like honey not like but not like a like weirdly way more double yolks like you're getting them like one every four eggs I would not drop double yolks you dropping double yolks for sorry way more double yolks yeah okay not a lot of there regular single yolks big single you wouldn't have enough protein to drop that much white I would get out the cleanest single yolks bro you don't eat well enough if I didn't eat if I didn't eat enough they'd be a little light they wouldn't be that yellow I wouldn't double Yol you you'd also be dropping fragile shells oh they would [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] no my shells would yell too loud and they crack yes sir what if he what if his eggs were wet ooh well helped me understand your plan times they're wet sometimes and they can't get dry dude science can't explain it science can't explain that I would never drop a wet egg well they always come out wet oh they're going to come out dry it would be dry and normal d That's not better it would hurt you so much to squeeze out Dr push out a dry egg I would Lube up and would it come out of his or his like new hole how many eggs do you think have been up the butts of a human total seven total number like so many bro seven to more than thousands and thousands and thousands I want to say 700,000 700 ,000 we've been bored peasants for a lot of history in human history 700 it's got to be so L that's so I think there's someone walking on this earth right now who's over a thousand I bet there's someone listen to this podcast right now who has one in even if even if you're talking like are we talking genuine eggs or cuz we made a toy now that resembles an egg that vibrates let say an egg with a Yol inside okay I would say 700 when do we domesticate chickens how long ago it's has fix for so long I would say 500 BC we domesticated the chicken okay guesses I don't know oh my God I have no idea we domesticated horses like say, BC oh I'm not even close we deticated horse is like 2,000 3,000 BC I think Chens oh what are you reading what is it boy okay it looks like there's some controversy here always 7,000 to 10,000 years ago wow so I was far off so we're talking 5,000 say 8,000 here let's just call it let's call call it 7,000 right it's so much older than that thought and you're going 7,000 let's just say 7,000 I mean bare minimum and this is assuming only a couple a year you're looking at we're looking at five digits it's a it's an astronomical the first in the first how many years you said and in 7,000 years oh you know I'm saying and how when when we domesticate chickens how long until someone puts an egg in their I'm saying I'm saying you're looking at at least two eggs per curious animals well okay here's the thing if it's 7,000 years of chicken was it question are you talking about people who successfully put the egg in without it cracking or people who just go for we don't care about this doesn't matter it's just more of the entrance it just has to go in it doesn't have to I I think if they if they like if they're like I wonder what this would feel like on like the rim of my butthole that doesn't count but if they put it in it cracks why do how much of the egg has to go into the ass for this to count for you like 30% I think it's just like the butthole has to open because you started to put something inside let's say enough the egg needs to go in that if you left your hand it's let me ask you this you you put 10% of an egg in your butt are you really walking around being like no I've never put an egg in my butt it's a good that's a good point I couldn't saw you put 10 what if you put 10% of it in and then it just falls out once you let it go is that really putting an egg in your butt yes yeah yeah 100% yeah and then and then like Gort the surf is trying to Sten that's stol for those who have put 30% or more of the egg sees you put 10% of egg in your butt and then and then you walk around the village being like no I didn't you're looking at this you're looking at this all wrong you're looking at this all wrong you're looking at it from the perspective of people who don't put eggs in their butts who would immediately say oh you put an egg in your butt but I'm looking at it from the perspective of person who is experienced think we should be Gat I would want if he only puts 10% in and I'm I've put [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 40 eggs you literally just become like you've literally just become like the furries who say are saying Sonic Fox doesn't account yes I'm a champagne egg in my ass okay that you're a real egg butt head or whatever I'm at the top of the cast system in this scenario well that doesn't change what you're saying is like at the end of the day this one is a binary if the egg enters your ass that's one if it doesn't that's zero let us know down in the comments if you dropped one before if you dropped if you just some people probably dropped an egg in their ass on accident my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] oh I'm thinking about it aping yep wide larger than the circumference Mar s's head and you put the you put the egg through the Gap a little bit but it's not touching any of the hole and then I take it out did I put an egg in my ass so I thought about this yes it it's like it's as if it's like a a laser like a barcode at the super put the gun in my mouth that's in his mouth while you're bald it scares me thank you I think you'll do it you're right thank you for the visual that convinc you done a great job convincing me of St today hey well that's hey leave out of this leave out of this we got a patron look like you're training day yeah yeah yeah do the patreon we got a patron if you want to check it out you don't have to you don't have to but but but he might he might use that it's up to you you make the call make the call okay oh L yeah oh L audio listeners if you're still here it's a gun all right guys AR make that look real all right guys hey we're out and enjoy your life okay so I had a dream that Aiden died yeah let's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] go yeah I won't applaud for that I had a dream that Aiden died and when the dream started I was in this office in the in the bullpen that's where I found out and I took it so hard yeah I'm crying I'm crying harder than I've cried at anything ever
