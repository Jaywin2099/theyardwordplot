 Gorg Stone Beard, &gt;&gt; do you remember Operation Anvil and Hammer? &gt;&gt; The truth is we were losing. &gt;&gt; Ran Leonus now. &gt;&gt; Oh, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] We have a way to contact Shria. &gt;&gt; I would have the four of you do what you believe is right. &gt;&gt; Blesses. &gt;&gt; Yeah, Stone Beard. &gt;&gt; Well, it's a mission. A deadly plague is broken out amongst the pirate crews of Leica. &gt;&gt; Well, we got to get the princess. &gt;&gt; Get your things together and then deploy when you're ready. Hello and welcome to the Yard DN D episode 7. Now, you might recall me telling you last time that it was five and I told y'all I'm I'm jetlagged, man. I traveled so far. &gt;&gt; Five was wrong. &gt;&gt; Five was wrong. But you may just stink about it. &gt;&gt; Today is seven. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I have a feeling, &gt;&gt; right? Today is seven. I think we just take I think we take the intro away from you, dude. You know, I trust you inherently. &gt;&gt; Uh, so last time in what was super episode 6, and hopefully smarter people than me wrote that at the bottom, uh, we caught up with all of you brave heroes in the Nexus. Found out what it is that you've been up to. Most importantly, uh, Ron Kaledus secretly became the romance novelist Jonathan Pork, which really looking forward to seeing. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I did. I did. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I forget that in this show you staple things into the world that you have to continue and follow up and &gt;&gt; oh, believe me, the life between us is like you you artist. &gt;&gt; It also has a thriving fan base. It's waiting for the sequel. &gt;&gt; It I mean it's at least starting like some review copies have gone out like it's catching on. I'm just &gt;&gt; you sold it to 20. So it's like this is your life. &gt;&gt; Like message like there's literal message boards though like literal message boards where people are just writing things and posting it and you have to walk by. &gt;&gt; Great book. Who is Jonathan Poor? &gt;&gt; It's true. You know, &gt;&gt; sprawled on the back of a pub wall. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Yeah. And those heartbreak tattoos, you know, the people that just you're getting them, just catching on. &gt;&gt; Stone Beard has a Walter White moment where he like he he opens it up and he's like JP. &gt;&gt; Uh we also learned uh that GJ Gorg Jr. has gone back to stay with her mom, Josie the Magnificent, a a a a large dragon. Um because everybody just sort of agreed that it was better that she not necessarily go actively into combat zones. Um then uh we found out Stone Beard is still in the process of uh unpacking some things that happened to him. Uh some memories that he had perhaps buried. He's looking at making some positive life changes overall. But the life between us &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; it's kind of helped him. &gt;&gt; It's helping. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's helping &gt;&gt; helping him get over that hump. &gt;&gt; But you know, &gt;&gt; we're going to find out. Well, I shouldn't say &gt;&gt; we don't we don't know. We're going to find out. But I believe what was up. Your your eyes are like the moon. Was that what it is that what it was? &gt;&gt; God, you guys know nothing of literature. &gt;&gt; And uh last but certainly not least, we found out Leonus was somewhat ineffectively trying to keep an eye on Princess Selenia, who super knew what he was doing, but thought it was charming. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Wow. also maybe had some some uh uh questionable visualizations that uh he revealed to Sanc Kofa in totality, &gt;&gt; but only Sanca. Nobody else knows what the visualization was. &gt;&gt; Sanca is a bro. He's not going to &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He's not He's not He's not going to out that. uh in the process of actually talking with Sanca about what you discovered, sharing with him the things that you saw and him ultimately counseling you that you all should probably keep it to yourselves because the type of people that would do such a thing who knows what else that they are capable of and that he himself would also look into it and he shared these things with you in the midst of his own truth. So &gt;&gt; nah, &gt;&gt; take that to mean what you will. &gt;&gt; Like nah type [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] No, I could keep that to myself. &gt;&gt; Take it to mean what you will. However, uh you all did choose your next uh mission after some internal debate as to whether or not you should go to uh uh to to help them out or to the Dominion of Leo. &gt;&gt; Leo's in the house. &gt;&gt; It was and it was decided that you would return to you guys home and on the way out you picked up a very enthusiastic Princess Selenia who you are escorting to Leo because of course &gt;&gt; she's an escort. &gt;&gt; She's going on vacation. &gt;&gt; It's that's I think it makes you the escort actually. No. Well, yeah. Okay. Sure. Yeah. I'm the escort. &gt;&gt; I can get behind that. &gt;&gt; Cool. &gt;&gt; She's going on vacation. She needs an escort to go with her right on vacation. &gt;&gt; I mean, you're heading in the same direction. Like that's that's just how that goes. And u with that, you will make your way through the nexus towards the portal to Leo, which is of course a a very uh popular way. Other people and sentients are making their way in and out as you all pass through. And the first thing that hits you is the smell of the seab breeze which the two of you find very familiar uh in just a warm uh breeze on a picturesque bright sunny day. The capital city of the Dominion of Leo is the Shattered Cove. &gt;&gt; It is a breathtaking blend of natural beauty and rough treacherous pirate ingenuity. It is built into a massive cove that leads into a narrow straight and it rises up from the sparkling turquoise waters and extends into the craggy cliffs cliffs that surround it. &gt;&gt; This is like the descendants. &gt;&gt; This is exactly like The Descendants. &gt;&gt; Dude, it is. &gt;&gt; It's one to one with The Descendants 3. &gt;&gt; Did you get the idea from &gt;&gt; Have you seen Disney Channel original movie The Descendants? &gt;&gt; Uh my children have. &gt;&gt; So yeah, we get we get where we get where Dave's getting &gt;&gt; We're adults. We're adults and we have seen it. &gt;&gt; They're adults who've seen all three descendants. &gt;&gt; Leo is similar. Leo is similar. &gt;&gt; It's just weird. &gt;&gt; Not in a bad web. &gt;&gt; It's It's a It's a great scene. &gt;&gt; Legally distinct. I'm legally distinct. &gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a lot of IP in that movie. &gt;&gt; I'm not I'm not It's The movie was nothing but leverage IP. Like that's literally the whole idea the franchise. &gt;&gt; Yes. Uh &gt;&gt; SOACL, baby. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] throw them up. Hey, throw them up. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; From afar, it looks like a halfaphazard paradise. A chaotic patchwork of shipwrecks lashed together with ropes and planks jutting out into the water combined with wooden walkways and buildings that climb up the cliffside just high enough for the ships to sail underneath uh through the straight coming and going into the town. The heart of the shattered cove is a flotillaa of ships. Uh some of which are intact, some are mere remnants and wreckage that have been repurposed into homes, taverns, markets, and pirate dens. The decks and holes of these vessels have been creatively altered, creating a multi-level network of platforms, and gangways. The pirate life is palpable here as bustling markets trade in exotic goods. Music and laughter fill the air, and while hidden alleyways speak of clandestine deals and whispered betrayals, the cove embodies both the freedom and the dangers of pirate life, a place where fortunes are won and lost in a day. And above the sheer cliffs that tower over the cove, a series of wooden walkways and ladders extend, connecting to more permanent structures that above the floating city below, leaving just enough room for ships to pass under them through the straight, often scraping their holes in the process. Pirate lords and influential merchants. What? &gt;&gt; Scraping their holes in the process. Unbelievable. Holes. The side of a ship. Hole. H. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, you So, you're up on Disney Channel movies, but not what the side of a ship is called. &gt;&gt; That's on me. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Dave spending all night writing this for Slime and Laugh. &gt;&gt; That's You know, I know what I signed up for. Uh, lords and influential merchants hold court in these elevated dwellings overseeing the chaotic activity below like watchful hawks. These cliffside buildings with their ocean inspired design feature thatch roofs, carved wooden totems, and colorful sails that catch the wind, giving the whole city an exotic but precarious look. At the highest point of the cliff stands the Temple of Horizon. A small but revered structure serving both as a lighthouse and a holy site dedicated to the god of freedom in the sea. The temple is constructed by a combination of driftwood, coral, and stone. With simple but towering spire that emits a radiant light over the cove, a constant reminder of Horizon's presence, it serves as a guide not just for ships, but for the pirates of Leo, who view their life of freedom as a sacred calling. The priestesses of Horizon bless ships that come to port, offering safe passage and protection on the high seas in exchange for offerings of plunder or good fortune. And finally, the dual ships of Captain Allora Stormchaser's Typhoon and Captain Rook Tide Walker's Depth sit pulled up on the sides of the adjoining cliffs by heavy ropes, ready to launch at a moment's notice. Gorg and Leonis, you are home in Leo, but I asked the two of you, are you from the capital of the Shattered Cove, or are you from somewhere else in the kingdom? &gt;&gt; I'm not from the Shattered Cove. I'm from a smaller area. Like my my family of sea elves lives lives under the water, offshore, further away. &gt;&gt; Like a family area, like a real kiss your mom, kiss your dad area. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So, well, a family &gt;&gt; Thailand park. &gt;&gt; You'd like to think that You'd like to think that families would be close out there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But sometimes you have trouble connecting with your your parents. Anyway, what you might call a rural rural area &gt;&gt; of of Leo. So, I I've been &gt;&gt; here, but I I did not grow up here. This is this is not my like home city. &gt;&gt; Perfect. And Gorg. &gt;&gt; I'm from the I'm the city boy, baby. &gt;&gt; It's like it's &gt;&gt; straight out of the cove. &gt;&gt; Just straight out of the co like I you know, I grew up in the those damn those damn buildings on the cliff side. Like that's my apartments, bro. Like we didn't have much, you know, but we had horizon. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; And for a lot of us, that was enough. That is true. You you all see immediately as you arrive in Leo, Gorg just kind of looks wisfully at what look like almost like stacked crates with just like one supporting beam underneath them that you're like one good rainstorm and those things are coming down. But &gt;&gt; you know they're sturdier than they look. &gt;&gt; They're sturdy, but they have come down. Let's be real, right? &gt;&gt; You know, I mean it's it's damn it's on damn coast. You know, it's gonna there's going to be storms. It's It's whatever. See, Horizon makes sure that everything can be okay. &gt;&gt; And I'm feeling more spiritual than I've ever felt cuz I'm back at home. Like, this is where I, you know, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; as far as Ran and and Stone Beard go, I mean, you all are citizens of this world. I leave it up to you if this is your first time in the Shattered Cove or if you've been here lots of times. &gt;&gt; Boys, are you feeling this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; This is my first time here. &gt;&gt; You feeling this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Too blue. Too much blue everywhere. &gt;&gt; Wow. It's um wet. &gt;&gt; It is very blue and very wet. Yep. &gt;&gt; That's great. That's great. It's &gt;&gt; great for you guys. &gt;&gt; Great. Yeah. I mean, we spend a lot of time in the water. &gt;&gt; Is that why you're always wet? &gt;&gt; I mean, it's more of a water where we're at, but you're still wet all the time. &gt;&gt; It's kind of a It's more my body, you know? It's like I You know, I'm a sea elf. So, I grew up in the sea. My body is built. &gt;&gt; You're wearing that shirt &gt;&gt; to be in the water all the time. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, this is &gt;&gt; a shirt. Is that a Leo made shirt? Yeah, it's Leo original. &gt;&gt; Leo. &gt;&gt; Yeah, Leo Studios. &gt;&gt; You, as you were standing there, you see Princess Selenia immediately start shimmering shimmeing out of the fairly um uh conservative dress that she was wearing and has basically a bikini with like a sarong skirt tied over it that is like kind of made out of netting. Uh, and the top of it is sort of made out of she seashells. And she immediately starts like clipping shells into her hair. &gt;&gt; Wa. &gt;&gt; She's like, "Do I look like a local girl?" She also, now that she is a dumpier, is literally white as a sheep. Like she's like ghostly white. &gt;&gt; How old is the princess? &gt;&gt; Uh, old enough. &gt;&gt; Excellent. All right. &gt;&gt; This is excellent news. &gt;&gt; Old enough. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It is not weird. Not weird. I will be looking at the princess. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm sorry. You're just ugling now. &gt;&gt; I'm doing anything to not make eye contact. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Princess, is it uh it's your first time in Lego? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I I mean, I don't get out much. Parents kind of kept me on a tight leash and I but I heard so much about this place. I always wanted to visit. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Princess, are you feeling this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; It's this is incredible. Like like look at like this. Like there's the music and I smell everybody just seems so happy and everybody's like carved up &gt;&gt; like just like &gt;&gt; we're home dude. &gt;&gt; What are you the princess of? &gt;&gt; I mean first of all you're not supposed to just ask a lady like what are you the princess of? &gt;&gt; Is that like your way? &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's like it's like it isn't like I mean like like like stone. I don't know. &gt;&gt; Sorry. I I served in the war sometimes. &gt;&gt; In the war. You see here's the here's the problem with you. I've been with this enough. You only bring up the war to avoid accountability. Think about that. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But we're at the beach now. &gt;&gt; I'm feeling torn cuz I really like the princess, but I don't like when you're belittled. &gt;&gt; You do. You do disengage sometimes. &gt;&gt; I just I don't like the beach. I like taking my clothes off. &gt;&gt; Wait, haven't we established you're literally topless? Wait, so weird. &gt;&gt; When you rage, your shirt pops off. &gt;&gt; So weird. Put away your puffers. &gt;&gt; But when I rage, it's different. It's a practical effective move. &gt;&gt; You like your puffers being off the clock. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; You do see coots. Your robotic cat is literally like already trying to like shake off the sand and it like kind of won't come off. Like that thing a real cat would do. Just sort of looking at it. &gt;&gt; Makes all my gears run a bit slower on my gizmos. And you see Selenia finally looks at you, Leonus, and she's like, "Well, how how do I look? I mean, is this is this how the the girls look here? Is this &gt;&gt; Did I Did I do it all right? &gt;&gt; I think you look really nice. You look uh you look like you're ready for a vacation. &gt;&gt; You look great. You look great. I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] around with you. You're going to fit right in on my hometown. I'm talking I'm talking to her, bro. &gt;&gt; If you like you want me to like She's looking for compliments. You're just sitting there doing nothing. All right. Thank you, Gord. &gt;&gt; Princess, your sh your dress uh looks like the ocean. I uh shells. [Music] &gt;&gt; He's trying to drop lines on me from &gt;&gt; He's trying to He is He's trying to knock off John. &gt;&gt; It's like from the Life Between Us. &gt;&gt; We got We got John Ham here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's from like the first five pages. Like he hasn't even like read the whole thing. &gt;&gt; Doesn't make any sense. It doesn't make any sense. It was pretty. I haven't read much, so I think I think it looks good. I think it was good words. &gt;&gt; I know you guys are on a mission, but do you have like some time to kind of show me around? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Show us your hometown, Gorg. &gt;&gt; Of course. I'll show you the place. You've been around, right? You took trips to the damn city. And &gt;&gt; I've been here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, we could go over, take a closer look at Typhoon, you know. I think that worship's pretty cool. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ, bro. Are is your whole life about scaring the host? &gt;&gt; We're not going to go look at a warship. &gt;&gt; Maybe she thinks it's the history behind the worship would be &gt;&gt; I think the worship sounds pretty cool. Like &gt;&gt; you and you all can see like these ships have been like literally like jacked up onto the cliff side. So if they get cut they're like like out out into the water. Um also like anywhere there's bars, there's clubs. I mean it is it is kind of like simultaneous especially you noticed this. I mean there is a militarist militaristic like undercurrent here but it is also like if Cancun were simultaneously prepared to defend Mexico &gt;&gt; you know like everybody's kind of having a good time but there are sort of like trebuchets that are sort of like covered like there's cannons that have been like painted pretty colors you know. &gt;&gt; Hey I I'm going to show you guys the best spot in town. Let's go. It's two blocks away. We walk two blocks and we arrive at it's like a wet cobblestone corner and it's just it's just kind of wet. There's a couple of baby turtles just kind of like milling about and there's like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] There's like poop on the ground and stuff &gt;&gt; like from the turtles. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And from probably guys &gt;&gt; and and I'm like &gt;&gt; guy poop. &gt;&gt; Tada. &gt;&gt; It's Portland. Dude, &gt;&gt; I thought Portland I thought Portland land was a different different settlement. Leo, &gt;&gt; this is literally where I grew up. Look at this. &gt;&gt; Yeah, man. This looks like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] No, that looks like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Is it Is it supposed to um &gt;&gt; It kind of burns in the back of my throat. It's like &gt;&gt; Yeah. No, no, it's good. That's the air. That's That's the cove air. I wanted to show you guys a cool spot. This is where This is my history. This is not interesting. Under Fred. &gt;&gt; This is so great, guys. We should We should know. We should go somewhere else to keep exploring. We have such limited time. &gt;&gt; This is wonderful. I feel like I definitely understand it better. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. Okay. &gt;&gt; So much of poop. &gt;&gt; We go somewhere else. It's fine. Uh but this I want to show you guys. It's like the spot. &gt;&gt; No, this is great. Maybe a pub nearby. &gt;&gt; Uh all of you give me perception checks. &gt;&gt; 17. &gt;&gt; Big thing. &gt;&gt; Big uh 22 &gt;&gt; 11 22 &gt;&gt; 18 &gt;&gt; 18. &gt;&gt; God damn, we're perceptive. &gt;&gt; Uh you are very perceptive. Uh you all are sort of kind of taking in the locals because it goes down different here than the Nexus. It just again everybody is kind of conventionally beautiful all at the same time. Like they've just kind of gotten sun and a lot of exercise. Like everybody just is sort of nicel looking. You however ran actually you stone beard it is salty and sandy and it smells like turtle poop. Like like what what what even is this? But &gt;&gt; I got I got this place downloaded. But you ran all of you sort of notice that like there's there's seagulls but there's like all kinds of wildlife. There's these small lizards that are about the size of your arm kind of crawling along that you all are very very accustomed to and other birds and odds and ends. However, Ran, you notice one of those iguanas is 100% following you. Like you guys walk and it kind of crawls along a little bit and you know it sits there and sort of licking its eyeballs and stuff and like if you go somewhere else like it like crawls after you and then just like stops and waits. &gt;&gt; Can I can I try to attack it? &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; I want to try to attack it. &gt;&gt; How would you like to attack it? &gt;&gt; I want to shoot an arrow. Do I have arrows? No, I don't have arrows. &gt;&gt; Or you can just guiding bolt just like hadukan at a random. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm going for a guiding bolt on it. &gt;&gt; Give me your attack. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it rolled a nine. So you all see Ron as just sort of like when like the bolt goes out and like blasts through the planks like down through a couple of them and you see and you see the iguana jumps lizard &gt;&gt; and like the iguana &gt;&gt; there's lots of lizards here that that one's following us. &gt;&gt; Selenia is like she looks at you and she goes like lizard and you see just like the black like shadow tendrils start coming to her hand. She's like we're getting in another fight. &gt;&gt; Not necessary. Lots of lizards here. &gt;&gt; Each one's different. It's following us. It's not because it's any particular kind of looking lizard. They look all &gt;&gt; You can't just shoot at lizards. &gt;&gt; It it it &gt;&gt; not in the scene. &gt;&gt; What do you mean it's following us? It's a lizard. &gt;&gt; That's why it's weird. They shouldn't do that. As you all are sort of arguing for a second, you see the lizard sits there a second and then it begins to transform um into a tobacci, which is a cat person. Um you see uh her fur is kind of a bluish green. Uh, same thing. She's got like long uh dreads, like people that like have lived by the beach for a long time. And when she stands up, both of you recognize Katagat immediately. She's just another highranking Pterodin from around here. And she says, "See, &gt;&gt; yes. Okay, you have noticed Katagat was following after you, but that does not mean you should started with a blast thing in an inhabited area." &gt;&gt; Kat, &gt;&gt; what did she say? What? What? You know her &gt;&gt; my boy. Welcome back. &gt;&gt; Hi. Hi. &gt;&gt; Uh, &gt;&gt; I don't reciprocate the hug, but she kisses me on the head. &gt;&gt; She's like, "Ah, Leon is Look at my boy. You're getting so big. Look at you with the muscles. Come, you give Kat." &gt;&gt; All right. Good. &gt;&gt; Is this an aunt or ex-lover? &gt;&gt; It's no he doesn't call me. Sometimes people have called Katag mommy before. This is true. &gt;&gt; I've never called her mommy. &gt;&gt; This is your mom. &gt;&gt; No. No. This is Mrs. Leon. &gt;&gt; It's No. No. No. No. No. No. Mrs. Leonus lives not far from here. &gt;&gt; Mrs. No. You stop. And with her tail, she's like, "You stop." No. Yes. &gt;&gt; Are you okay? I know he threw a guiding bolt at you. Are you fine? &gt;&gt; Oh. Do you think such a pitiful attack could hurt the god? No. &gt;&gt; A strong attack was strong. &gt;&gt; Why? Why are you following us? &gt;&gt; I know that you all are here on your mission and I just thought that I would keep an eye on you and I was going to say hello at the appropriate time &gt;&gt; which I suppose is now. Also, Leonus, Leonus, Leonus. And she like elbows you. She's like, "Are you not going to introduce me to your friend here?" &gt;&gt; And you see Selenia is simultaneously like right next to you with like a hand in front of you, but like the shadows are forming in her palm. Like I'm ready. She just say the word. You start blasting. I'm going to start blasting it and like you can shoot with the bone. &gt;&gt; There's no blasting. You can put it away. Th This is This is &gt;&gt; This is his ex-lover. Selenium. &gt;&gt; Leonus is like a son to me. He was a wee. &gt;&gt; This is Leonus's girlfriend. &gt;&gt; Leon girlfriend. &gt;&gt; She's not my girlfriend. She's not my girlfriend. &gt;&gt; And when you say she's not my girlfriend, she looks at you for a second and she goes, "Not no. Of course." No, absolut I'm I'm uh I'm I'm Selenia. And you see uh Katagot takes her hand and immediately like nuzzles it and she's like, "Very nice to meet you, child. Look at your gorgeous outfit. You will fit right in like a local. And if this blue domain does not want you, I'm sure we will find many people that will make your acquaintance." &gt;&gt; A lot of strapping suitors here. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. She's not an escort. It's way, but in my estimation, you all must be the escorts. Yes, you're the ones walking with the girl. That makes you the escort. &gt;&gt; All right. We've had, you know, there's been a lot of nice meeting each other and great aids here and a lot of uh blasts from the past, but I I I remember that we're here because of a a plague breaking out. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Should we go maybe to like a local eery or anywhere away from here? &gt;&gt; Well, shaped building. Yes. Um, listen. Um, the the captain's um Captain Stormchaser and Captain Tide Walker said that to give you a moment to get your bearings, get a taste of home, get a good bowl of this stew with the seafood, with the freshness, with the fish, you know. It's like, I know. &gt;&gt; Around here, we call that the next. &gt;&gt; You can't. No, they don't like it. You You can try, but they don't. &gt;&gt; It's not the same. And even when you order it, they think you're yelling at them. &gt;&gt; It's so good. I'm going to I'm going to level with you, Selenia. You do you don't want to try it. No, no, no. She He's being difficult. It When you have your first taste, &gt;&gt; it is like changing. Yes. In the back of the throat and it clears out the sinuses that I &gt;&gt; I eat one chocolate bar every day. &gt;&gt; It's all I have every day. &gt;&gt; So, I'm down to try whatever. &gt;&gt; Really? It's all new to me. &gt;&gt; I like that. See, some people are happy to be home. Some people are happy to be in a new place that's that's awesome that everyone knows about. They love the place I showed them. So listen, Mr. Stone Beard, um, yes, obviously there is a bit of a plague, a bit of a problem, but the captains, they said like everything will still be terrible tomorrow. You can still come, you can enjoy yourself, you get the good meal, and then there's time for everything to be terrible later. That is how we do with Leo. It's relax &gt;&gt; naps at lunch type of thing. &gt;&gt; Hey, this is Oh, I love the full belly. And then I lay on the roof in the sun. Ah, beautiful day. &gt;&gt; I hate to I hate to ruin the the come home vibe. And I know I know you want to show us around, but is a is the plague here in this city. &gt;&gt; Look at look at how he's being just like okay wait. You are quite right. We should act much faster. Yeah. This young woman is very safe next to you. &gt;&gt; I I'm I feel like I feel like you're being facicious right now. Facious. I thought maybe you know. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. I am a teaci. Taxaci. I don't know what they facicious. Is that like a fish person? &gt;&gt; I'm I'm I'm running through I'm thinking in my head. I'm going through a mental catalog of I'm thinking about Cruncher. I'm thinking about Thimble. I'm thinking about how all these people just they they push me to the edge every day. I wake up and I'm pushed to the edge and kat I don't care how aious you are. I I would love to see more. &gt;&gt; See that is the thing I am &gt;&gt; right. I would love to see more of this place and you see she comes towards you but it's like her tail sort of wraps around your shoulder like the kind of bro like but it's her tail and she's like clearly you have forgotten how we do things here. You must do the breathing and the unwinding &gt;&gt; and then everything will be terrible tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Kat, let me just let me just &gt;&gt; break through break through the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] here. One moment, please. &gt;&gt; Whoa. &gt;&gt; Do I just do I need to put on a mask perhaps? Okay. &gt;&gt; Do I need to do I take any precautions? &gt;&gt; What do you think the mask is going to do? [Music] &gt;&gt; Everyone knows they're ineffective. Yeah. Are you disguising yourself? No, you're wearing his blue. Why is he put on the mask? &gt;&gt; I saw him wearing his mask in his car. &gt;&gt; I saw him wearing the car. &gt;&gt; I look I &gt;&gt; You're You're a very conspicuous elf, &gt;&gt; you know. You know, I wasn't pumped about going home. I'm I'm a little bit sensitive about a little sensitive about germs. I don't know much about the I've traveled a lot. I don't know about the ethmology of this. You &gt;&gt; while you're talking, you see Selenia ties a like bandana across her face and she goes to Taiwan across yours and she says, "I I think I'm half dead. I don't even know if I can get sick, but I'm with you. You're from here and you say we should take precautions and you know what? You protecting yourself isn't hurting anybody else. So, I'm with you." &gt;&gt; Someone has my back in this group. &gt;&gt; You guys look like you're going to rob a raft. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. When you say somebody has my back, you audibly hear a thimble scoff, but he's not on your shoulder. He can fly. He's like kind of right behind you. You're like, "Somebody has my back." And he's &gt;&gt; Please lead us out of here cuz I actually can't stand the smell of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Yes. Maybe. Maybe you do not take them to the turtle poop place. &gt;&gt; I grew up here. &gt;&gt; Yeah, but you left for a reason. &gt;&gt; You are these turtles? &gt;&gt; Yes. Isn't that crazy? &gt;&gt; They get to be as big as you were that size. &gt;&gt; I was that size. That guy is probably How old are you? &gt;&gt; He said he's only three and a half years old. &gt;&gt; Three and a half years. &gt;&gt; That's it. It's I mean, you know, and then you grow up like Horizon. &gt;&gt; They're very LWD turtles. Like even like &gt;&gt; what's like the the primary language in Leo? Is it is it all &gt;&gt; speak the common tongue? Alth although there is definitely like a a a pirate sort of thieves can't, you know, like a pirate sort of shorthand. &gt;&gt; Can they speak it? &gt;&gt; Yes, the two of them would be able to speak it for sure. I mostly know swear words. &gt;&gt; Um, she says, "Well, of course you can go to a few places. Maybe you want to go home and visit your mother." She says, "You've not come home in a long time." She's so proud of her boy. Um, there's the shipwreck quarter where you can go and you can do the shopping. Um, there's the Broken Fang Tavern where like the mean boys go. I know you like to do the altercations with the locals. You like to do these things. Um, whatever you want is here. I mean if you cannot get it in the shops perhaps Katagot knows a place where you can get the thing but then you must not ask Katagot where the thing came from because if you have to ask where it came from you don't want it that bad Katy could you give us a moment yeah okay um I tell you what Princess Senia I will give you a tour away from this stinky place she kind of comes up and extends an arm and you see Selenia just sort of looks at you and she's like well I'm going to okay just uh if you need anything just like okay &gt;&gt; she's cool you &gt;&gt; it's cool you'll be fine &gt;&gt; um and like right when she turns and walks away with Selenia she looks at you and with her tail like kind of like slaps you on the shoulder like and then turns and walks away with the princess &gt;&gt; her girl now &gt;&gt; y steal your girl new lover and an old lover &gt;&gt; boys do you think that she's trying to stop us from getting active &gt;&gt; no this is a it's a Lego thing right you guys tell me &gt;&gt; culturally It's absolutely a Leo thing. It's absolutely a like relax. I &gt;&gt; think we should call me crazy. I don't think we should be going to the the ship mall. &gt;&gt; Oh, the ship mall is like part of the culture. It's like even if the world is falling apart, &gt;&gt; you still go to the ship mall. &gt;&gt; You still go to the ship mall. You still you still eat some, &gt;&gt; you know? You still get you still relax. &gt;&gt; I wanted to try that. I wanted to try that. &gt;&gt; Like, why do you think me and him are like this? He's all high strong cuz he's not from the city. Cuz they do weird [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] back there. But but it's culturally this is how we do stuff. And if you want to spit all over that Tua, &gt;&gt; I just want to I I just want to get back home. If that means killing the pirate plague, whatever we're doing here, can we just do that first? &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, first off, it's a plague. So it's like &gt;&gt; it's just going to run its course. Like there's nothing we can do to help that, you know? It's &gt;&gt; Do you not believe in the LCC? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Do do you not do you not believe in &gt;&gt; I believe there's people who work there. But what &gt;&gt; are you are you vaccinated? &gt;&gt; When when I served in the war, &gt;&gt; we didn't have these vaccinations. We didn't have them. &gt;&gt; They did. When you signed up for the ter we get 20 vaccinations, you have to have one. &gt;&gt; When you enlist in the ter became a member, you &gt;&gt; uh don't see your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] name on here. During the war, so &gt;&gt; that's a book of the war. &gt;&gt; That's interesting. That's a book of war. &gt;&gt; We're both the you just open it. It just says me. Like that's who I know was there. &gt;&gt; The new ter. &gt;&gt; Look, I I'm not I didn't want to say anything, but Stone Bread when I got that when I when we got our shots like I felt like kind of weird. [Music] &gt;&gt; May maybe maybe that's why GJ can't talk. &gt;&gt; Like think about it. &gt;&gt; Everyone did about the shakes. &gt;&gt; I saw that. &gt;&gt; I I say the Leo like C language. Don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] encourage. I'm just saying. &gt;&gt; I can't believe that you wanted to come here. I can't believe you brought me back to this place. &gt;&gt; I felt really weird when I got it. And I think Stone Bread might have a point. Oh, you hear I used to stone. &gt;&gt; It is like It is like weird nautical metaphors and like whistles and like sounds you'd hear on a ship at night and stuff, but they're like clearly arguing while they're &gt;&gt; GJ is really into Rubik's cubes. &gt;&gt; I want to look at what her food touches. Uh, look, I know we have a mission and nobody loves doing missions more than me, but I think we loves &gt;&gt; I think we'd be remiss &gt;&gt; if we didn't at least do a couple of things before getting started. And it's not because I want to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] around. It's because I want to find out some information about where Counselor Barrist is. Cuz I want to find out who did Operation Anvil and Hammer. All right. So, we have a mission, but we have a mission inside the mission. &gt;&gt; Yeah. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it. Okay. and we don't find out information if we go right to the mission and go home. &gt;&gt; Theoretically, uh, Leo is renowned for being a place where you can easily get information cuz people are coming and going through here and it's like one of the things they trade in is info. &gt;&gt; But I'm down to go to any of the place. I'll let you pick not, you know, I we can go back to your mom's or I guess all of us this time go to your mom's house &gt;&gt; this time. &gt;&gt; Real funny stone bread. You're going to meet her and feel bad when you say that. &gt;&gt; I'll go to his mom's house. You guys go shopping. I do think he's charming with mothers. &gt;&gt; I feel I felt like maybe maybe we were diverging for a bit when you started talking more about the plague, but as usual, I think you're right. It's worth the time to go and talk to people. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I can't take you seriously with that mask on. Can you take it off? It is like so insane. &gt;&gt; We don't know the etmology. &gt;&gt; I mean, I I'm glad you're wearing it. It is hard to hear you. It's I mean, with it on. Do you know etmology is a is that describe the beginnings of words? &gt;&gt; What what what is the what is the what is the word? &gt;&gt; Uh &gt;&gt; I was going to let it I was let I was going to let it go. I was my bad. No, what is it? What's the word? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Inmology is whatology. &gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; We don't know the entomology. &gt;&gt; I was leaving that as a little Easter egg for chat. You know what I mean? Like they feel so good when it's just cuz the mask but it sounds like you're saying etmology. That's just the wrong word. While you guys are sort of like standing here and kind of walking along having this discussion, uh all over the city, you see all sorts of things like the the city kind of extends a ways out into the water in these like lashed together craft, but you also see censient coming in and out of the water. You see uh some of them look like uh large constructs like uh like the size of people walking out. Some of them are very small, like the size of gnomes walking in and out. Um, you also what's what looks sort of like pale people kind of covered in uh seaweed and all in barnacles and things like they've been down in the water a long time just sort of coming and going, which of course you two know is normal. &gt;&gt; I was going to say that from my perspective or like my, you know, I grew up underwater. I grew up literally like in the in the ocean like way out of this city. &gt;&gt; You know, I haven't since I haven't been here. I want to relax a little. I want to chill. I'm being pushed to the edge. I think I'll leave you guys to the mall and the investigating up here. I think I'm going to go try, you know, cool down with the swim and go meet a few people like in the in the bay. &gt;&gt; Right when you say that, Selenia is just behind you. She wasn't and then she is just behind you. She's like, I don't think I need to breathe anymore. Can I come? &gt;&gt; I don't &gt;&gt; like and when she's smiling, you see her like very small fangs. &gt;&gt; You don't need to breathe anymore. Yeah. Come with me. Perfect. Wait, me and &gt;&gt; legally distinct. &gt;&gt; Me, why don't we split up? Why don't we split up? Me and Daffy, I mean, Selenia. Me and Selenia will go, we'll go talk to people. &gt;&gt; A little name. He remembered. &gt;&gt; Me and Selenia will go under the water. Talk to some people there. &gt;&gt; I get it. &gt;&gt; No, there's nothing to get. There's lots of people there. It's a public place. &gt;&gt; It's not private. It's a public place with a bunch of people. &gt;&gt; I just said I get it. &gt;&gt; Uh, &gt;&gt; you keeping the mask on underwater? &gt;&gt; No. No. Because there's no air under water, idiot. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Be like water boarding yourself. Yeah. That's &gt;&gt; wouldn't make any sense, huh? &gt;&gt; Just you, Stone Beard, uh, feel the very small feet of thimble land on your shoulder. And he just kind of leans in. He goes like, Stone Beard, is all right if I hang out with you cuz I kind of can't swim. The moment I feel him on my shoulder, just out of like natural reaction, I just kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] grab him and then and then I'm like, "Oh yeah, my no, my bad. My bad." And then I I just put him in my cousin, &gt;&gt; right? And you hear like he's like, "Whoa, hey. Oh, it's Sandy in here now. Let me help you with this." And you hear like nipples start like cleaning and things. Perfect. So, my understanding that uh Leonus is going to go under the water. Uh what are the three of you going to do? &gt;&gt; Well, where do you want do you want to shop? You want to go to the the bar? Your mom? &gt;&gt; Look, I mean, it would be cool to see my mom again, but she's going to live a long time. So, it's I can come back. We're do it. &gt;&gt; Consistently errant assumptions about family life. I like it. Like, like lean into it. Yeah. Got all the time in the world. &gt;&gt; Let's go shopping. I mean, look, parents famously live forever, so let's shop. &gt;&gt; I'm wear I've been wearing this shirt my entire life. &gt;&gt; Let's uh let's Yeah, let's hit let's shut that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] down. &gt;&gt; All right. Is you all sort of split up in Leonus, you kind of make your way down to the water. Sort of the moment your toes hit it, like something in you sort of like eases up just a little bit. uh is you're here on the shore of the sea and you see um Selenia sort of looks stands next to you and she's like okay so full disclosure pretty sure I don't need to drown or breathe if I start drowning I'm going to just go up and you do your thing okay like don't don't wait for me I'll be okay &gt;&gt; pretty sure I don't though &gt;&gt; you can hold my breath a really long time &gt;&gt; uh do you well we'll just figure it out as we go &gt;&gt; we're about to find out yeah I'm ready &gt;&gt; okay Uh well I we're weighted into the water and I assume there's there's a like shallow areas of water. It kind of drops off. &gt;&gt; As you kind of get down under the water you see what you very much expect that the shattered cove goes again a ways even for it's like the suburbs were just like the aquatic and subterranean uh members of this place goes out uh into the distance. And I'm not going to do the whole but you know you do see she's sort of like &gt;&gt; can can I I can speak underwater right? &gt;&gt; So can she still understand me when I'm talking under water? &gt;&gt; She can and she does not need to breathe. So is you see she sort of stops for a second and goes &gt;&gt; I didn't drown. &gt;&gt; That's all right. I didn't I didn't like that we I didn't like that you live tested it. &gt;&gt; Well I just figured if it was going to go wrong I wanted to go wrong with the shore right there. All right. Well, we're I'll swim slow. Follow me. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; I I'm not super familiar with this area. I came here a handful of times. And uh but I think let's go see if we can find a little like corner store, a little hangout among these homes. And uh if we can't if we can't meet a few people that can tell us what's going on. &gt;&gt; Hey, just real quick, I'm I'm I'm sorry if I stressed you out. I thought it'd just be fun to &gt;&gt; No, you're not stressing me out. It's not you, it's just everybody else. I feel like we're here and the issue of this plague and is so pressing and also I feel like we're we're being influenced or controlled by like things we don't really understand right now. Just a lot has happened recently and it's it's it's really getting to me. But I feel a lot better now that we're down here. &gt;&gt; I'm literally a princess who had to get kidnapped and possessed to have any form of autonomy. So, I kind of I kind of know what it is that you're getting at. &gt;&gt; You're surprisingly you're surprisingly go with the flow considering everything that's going on. &gt;&gt; Man, I've been waiting my whole life for something else. &gt;&gt; I get what you mean. I got away from home for for similar reasons. I think &gt;&gt; as you look out, there are other sea elves and things swimming around too. And give me a perception check or investigation, whichever is higher. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I'll take uh perception. Uh, oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 23 total. &gt;&gt; Perfect. Um, you can tell that some of these elves are sick. Uh, even even as they're swimming around like they're still kind of &gt;&gt; are they like visually like is there something wrong with like their skin or they just like is a &gt;&gt; like they like their eyes are kind of kind of sunk a little bit like they're they're swimming a little slower than you know they're capable of. It's like they do just sort of seem out of sorts. &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, I &gt;&gt; hand out a bunch of masks. I &gt;&gt; I uh reach back into the uh the pocket of like my mask tunic and I'd take the mask out slowly and then just put it back on. Even though even though it definitely doesn't do anything underwater, I just, you know, comfort comfort. And I was like, maybe just, you know, you don't have to put yours on, but I'm going to put mine on. Uh these these guys these guys are sick. &gt;&gt; Wait, don't aren't they going to think we're just going to rob them, though? Meanwhile, back up on the shore, uh, is you all are making your way through here sort of down towards, um, uh, the shipwreck quarter. You do see stand set up, uh, people selling all sort of like, um, grilled fish and like grilled seafood and things, right? From, uh, a lot of the birds that you see flying around, you also see being grilled, like those um, lizards and things. Uh, there's people selling seashells and gems uh, in things from like all five kingdoms. uh are just sort of like laid out on display. Um which you know is mostly from shipwrecks and battles and quite frankly uh coastal raids &gt;&gt; villages but it it's all like laid out for sale here. &gt;&gt; I'm walking by I'm like fake fake. That one's real. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Fake fake. &gt;&gt; Your mom's fake. &gt;&gt; Anyway, it's not a political thing at the end of the day. It's like it's just &gt;&gt; I know what &gt;&gt; I mean like &gt;&gt; it feels political. Damn. They got [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] from Waldane here. This is a This is awesome. That's great. &gt;&gt; It's fake. That's fake, too. &gt;&gt; What do you mean it's fake? &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's &gt;&gt; Well, what does it matter if it's fake? &gt;&gt; Well, that's if no one knows. &gt;&gt; That's a good point. &gt;&gt; I mean, how do you know when something's premium and not premium? Cuz like this all looks premium. &gt;&gt; I mean, it feels a guy like me feels like it's premium. Like, who am I? &gt;&gt; I hear what you're saying. &gt;&gt; Wait, I want to do a little investigation check. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Just cuz I'm not like I'm not sure about this area. &gt;&gt; Same thing. Give me investigation or perception. You you both can either investigation. &gt;&gt; I ripped a I ripped a thick 18. &gt;&gt; What is it that you're looking trying to figure out? &gt;&gt; Um trying to figure out if there's one any danger and two if if uh this plague thing is around us. &gt;&gt; Two things. You've been in enough rough areas that like yes, this is sort of the tourist presentation layer, but every single one of these people will stab you and sleep like a baby tonight. Like that's just where you are. Um, I got a Oh, wait. I got [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 16 &gt;&gt; 19 perception or investigation? &gt;&gt; Uh, in perception. &gt;&gt; Okay. And that was what? &gt;&gt; 19. Perception. &gt;&gt; Um, you as you were kind of keeping an eye on it. Uh, like everything you realize there's the game, there's the scam they run on the tourists, but a lot of these people there is sort of like maybe in the back they kind of got some legit stuff. Um, and you do see some sick people. It's kind of coughing. I won't deafen you with coughing into the microphone, but u some of them are coughing and you do see uh quite a few empty stalls uh which you know is not a thing. &gt;&gt; Uh it it's like uh life crowds into every inch of this place. So if somebody is not here with their stalls cuz they can't be. However, you notice something else kind of at the edge of one of these booths. You see a woman who was probably beautiful once. Uh she's excellent bone structure and things like that, but you can see on her neck it is like ripped open down to the bone. Uh and she's clearly undead. Uh but like otherwise she'd be a normal person if not for the fact that like her throat was ripped out at some point and she's looking at you and when she makes your eye contact with you, she kind of goes, &gt;&gt; "Uh I'm going to go look at the uh other the other store &gt;&gt; for a sec. There's another store. street doesn't work. There's a booth at the end. &gt;&gt; We'll just come with you. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we can go. &gt;&gt; No, it's like a It's like a It's like a undead only type of store. &gt;&gt; Do they have those? &gt;&gt; They I mean, no, &gt;&gt; they're new. They're new here. &gt;&gt; They're You said it was your first time. &gt;&gt; No. Well, local. I'm going to go. So, &gt;&gt; you can just say you want to go without being weird about it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You have to make up like it. &gt;&gt; I didn't hear the last thing you said. &gt;&gt; Just you're being weird about it. Just &gt;&gt; bye. &gt;&gt; Okay. Um uh and while he walks away, uh what are the two of you going to do again? You know, it is weird that there's so much empty space here. &gt;&gt; Stumb the thing is I've been coming here since I was a little a little turtle and it's there's fewer stalls happening. There's a lot of scams in this beautiful place and I love a scam and I love finding out a scam. &gt;&gt; Hey, then I have an idea. &gt;&gt; What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; Well, there's an empty stall. We could just take over the stall and start running some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] scams. Want to start a scam? &gt;&gt; I'm really good at that. Three card monty. &gt;&gt; Are you? &gt;&gt; I'm very good at it. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; I learned it in the war to basically earn cigarettes. &gt;&gt; I guess I could be some sort of carnival barker to make people call me and then and then I get them and then we can earn some money. And &gt;&gt; all right, &gt;&gt; give me give me slight of hand with advantage here. &gt;&gt; A dirty 20. &gt;&gt; He he starts moving it around and you are like, "No, that's my not my car." He's actually pretty good at it. &gt;&gt; Okay, we can make some money here. &gt;&gt; This is pretty good. So, yeah. Uh, we just set up in a stall. It looks like terrible. &gt;&gt; You give me persuasion. &gt;&gt; See how good you are at like luring in marks. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. 25. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; You guys go into business finessing people like pretty quickly over here. Like the moment his back is &gt;&gt; turn a free bowl of &gt;&gt; What's the store called? The store is called uh &gt;&gt; it's called uh the full monty. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what it's called. That's what it's called. It's called the &gt;&gt; full It's Hey, it's it's beat a famous or beat a beat a war criminal. &gt;&gt; Beat beat a geriatric war criminal, win a,000 rupees. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And they come on. Come on. Try to beat him. It's it's it's the favorite game of the all the all come and come all &gt;&gt; win some shells here. &gt;&gt; Win some shells. &gt;&gt; Uh The currency here are little shells made out of gold though. So they they are like they're the same like weight as other kingdoms. Uh but they look like little shells. &gt;&gt; Like someone comes up and they just they play they Oh, close one. Show them the right one. Show them the right one. &gt;&gt; You you definitely look like the type of guy who could beat me. &gt;&gt; You got close though. It's only three. So next up, come on. Let's go. Let's do this. And we're just churning. &gt;&gt; Here's You all are finessing people. Uh, Ran, uh, you follow this woman and you can like very clearly see her. She's like kind of slowly walking and every once in a while she kind of looks back over her shoulder um to see if you're there. And as she's walking through here, yes, everybody knows there's undead in Mory. And yet, it's still very common for her to walk by people and they're like, "Hey, you know, like you can see down to her neckbone um as she walks by." And then finally she sort of like makes a point of like sort of moving a tent flap back and looks at you and then walks inside. &gt;&gt; I want to follow her. &gt;&gt; Uh and when you come in um you see it is uh a little dark in here like there's kind of like a a single shaft of sunlight down the middle is like sort of like a break in the tent there. And she's just sort of sitting in a chair and she goes, "Mr. Kaladus, &gt;&gt; do I know you?" No, but I know you. Uh, and I know what gets your attention. &gt;&gt; Are we in a weed store? &gt;&gt; She's like, "Actually," and she points and you do see on a bench there's some of that like Leo seaweed. You know what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; The dried Leo leaf. &gt;&gt; Look, I don't really have like a lot of money or shells or whatever you guys got. &gt;&gt; This one is on the house. Uh, and she leans back and she's like, "Um, you do this is this is this is good. You like this, right?" &gt;&gt; Your face. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I like it. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. I'll remember it in the future, but uh right now we got to talk business. And right in front of you, she changes to a face that you've seen before. She has pale skin and red hair that is long and straight. uh horns uh in teeth and a pair of red wings folds out from her back. This is Kirana uh who is a succubus uh you all helped faked her death in a previous mission which is one that you can see at sometime in the future potentially. But uh she leans back and she's like, "Hey, so I'm not here for any trouble. I told you I owe you guys. Uh but I kind of got paid a bit of a fortune to find you." Who paid you? &gt;&gt; It would be unladylike for me to talk about who paid me, but I'm I I had to get you. &gt;&gt; Damn. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What the hell? &gt;&gt; Woo. You better pace it, boy. I'll be carrying you out of here. &gt;&gt; From my buming ass. &gt;&gt; They they literally call it seaweed for a reason. Yeah. That's why everybody's so chill around here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, hold on. You want to like You're trying to someone like want you to find me? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Cool. &gt;&gt; You have all that, by the way. &gt;&gt; Well, I was going to Yeah. Thanks. Like, do do you know how much I'm going to owe Zipper now for like having to figure out where it is that you were going to be, you know, known criminal mastermind Zipper? &gt;&gt; Do you know Zipper? &gt;&gt; It's Everybody knows Zipper. You're really in trouble when Zipper knows you. &gt;&gt; No one No one knows Zipper at the same time. &gt;&gt; That's Well, yeah. Zipper could be anybody. I mean, which I guess is kind of the brilliance, right? &gt;&gt; Um, &gt;&gt; so are you like going to like kill me? &gt;&gt; No. I mean, not today. &gt;&gt; I mean, that wasn't I mean, nobody paid me to. I mean, like, full disclosure, if somebody met my price, of course, I'd kill you. But no, that's not what I'm here for, &gt;&gt; right? So, who sent you again? &gt;&gt; Like I said, that's not important. What is important? And she reaches in her pocket and she pulls out a sending stone that has a little cross etched in the top of it, and she just flicks it to you. She's like, "Somebody wants to talk to you. I don't ask questions." Uh, &gt;&gt; hello. &gt;&gt; That's it's okay. You you you just you press it and you you talk and like but don't do it in front of me. Like the whole like I don't know. I didn't I didn't ask. &gt;&gt; You want should you leave the room? Like &gt;&gt; Yeah. You leave the room. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm gonna leave &gt;&gt; all with the table and all the secret. &gt;&gt; No, you leave the room. I'll stay here. &gt;&gt; Right. And I'm going to I'm going to do the like hot undead woman. And like right when she says it, she turns changes back into that. And she's like this is I thought I thought this would be your thing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The neck a little much. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; But no, we'll talk about that later. Like while you say that, it sort of like heals in a little bit to where it's like not completely ripped, but like maybe survivable. And she's like, "Yeah, but this could be anybody just with like a bleeding neck wound. Like I needed you to know." &gt;&gt; So succubus, you said. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; I did talk about that later. I have a call apparently, so I'm going to take this call. &gt;&gt; Just just one quick thing. And she turns back into a succubus in front of you. And again, she's sort of wearing this like red almost like tattered gown. And you see the sword hanging from her hip and she's like, "How the how the guys doing?" Like, I know Stone Beard was a little upset at first, but I feel like we kind of like had an understanding. &gt;&gt; No, I mean, they're doing fine. I mean, Leonus is kind of going through like a weird watching peeping tom. &gt;&gt; I mean, but he was he was that cute girl with him. I mean, of course, I had eyes on him when he went out into the water. &gt;&gt; The victim. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Wait, he wasn't just like drowning that girl, was he? And you see like her her wings immediately start to like come out. &gt;&gt; No. Oh, no. No. She says I'm She says she can like breathe forever or &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. &gt;&gt; So, they're good. Sounds made up. Stone beard's an alcoholic. Um &gt;&gt; Well, then that sounds normal. &gt;&gt; And the turtle's still here. &gt;&gt; It's &gt;&gt; You just hear muffles from outside. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You do see she sort of leans over and she's like, "We have not been gone long for them to be doing crime like actively. &gt;&gt; A little bit of crime never hurt anybody, you know." &gt;&gt; And she's like, "Should I mess with them a little bit? just a little bit. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, that would be awesome. &gt;&gt; And like immediately she turns into this like wisened old cenome or sea elf woman and she's like, "Oh, I just have my husband's pinchion from the war." &gt;&gt; Uh yeah. Also, if Stone Beard always picks the right cup, he kind memory loss alcohol. &gt;&gt; That's like even though she still has this old face, her voice goes completely back to normal. She goes, "That's the scam, Ran. That that he always knows." &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's the scam. &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, again, a call. This thing has been ringing for a couple minutes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm going to You also You didn't Well, you can tell them that you saw me cuz you'll never find me unless I want you to. Okay. Bye. And you see she sort of like goes out the other side of the tent as this like old seal. &gt;&gt; Weird. Creepy. All right. &gt;&gt; She's like, "Get remember that is how it feels when you do it." And then like pulls it back close. &gt;&gt; Uh, all right. I'm pressing the settings tone. &gt;&gt; Perfect. Meanwhile, under the ocean, what is it that you're looking for? &gt;&gt; Uh, so I'm looking out on like what is like basically sprawling like more suburban life that extends out into the bay, which is like a lot &gt;&gt; and there there are still ships and almost everything that you've got up on the shore. There's like like Temples of Horizon and stuff. You see, this is mostly catered to like aquatic people that can't come out. Yeah. Uh the amphibious people are kind of going back and forth, but you see like sahagan uh which is very hard to say and even harder to spell which uh normally are it's like very aggressive almost kind of like sea goblins. That's a bit of an oversimplification. &gt;&gt; Like it's spelled s a h. &gt;&gt; Yep. Swagen. &gt;&gt; They're from Final Fantasy. I always call them sahogans. &gt;&gt; Yep. They are not from Final Fantasy. They're in Final Fantasy. Yes, &gt;&gt; they're from Final Fantasy. Um it's there's protracted debate about how to say it and and I'm I'm still not doing it justice with Saga. Um uh like you but you see kind of like it's almost they're like street toughs kind of in an alley down there. So it is almost like a mirror of what you see above the water below the water. &gt;&gt; I'm swimming uh you know I'm swimming a little slow. Uh trying to hide my you know this is the first time I've been able to swim freely in like kind of like an open ocean in a while. So, I'm actually I'm actually pushing down like some small I'm like combination of relie but tiny bit frustrated cuz I got to swim a little slow. &gt;&gt; Roll 2d6 for me if you would. &gt;&gt; Yes, please. She's like you don't have to you don't have to wait for me. You could like do some laps if you want. Like I know. &gt;&gt; No, I think you should I think we should stay close. &gt;&gt; Six. &gt;&gt; Uh you see about six people actively laughing at you for having a mask on. &gt;&gt; They're like this guy scuba diving. Like what's what's this dude's deal? I just feel like you know &gt;&gt; like like mo most of them were trying to be polite about &gt;&gt; see your lips through the wet and they're like &gt;&gt; you know like a torture trying not to pay attention continue swimming like forward and down like further into the further you get the darker it gets cuz it does sort of like trail further downwards as you're coming down. &gt;&gt; And uh can you can Selenia can you see see fine down here? You know, like I'm used to it, I realize. But &gt;&gt; she's like, "Uh, I'm quickly discovering my limitations, but I mean, as long as I'm near you, I I know all I need to see." Oh, wait. I mean, no, I mean, no, I can see. Yeah, I I'm going to stop talking. &gt;&gt; Uh, I I avoid I'm like trying to avoid eye contact with her. That's Yeah, that's good. I think we're we're we're This is This is nice. This is nice. So, I I uh am as we swim along further, I'm like a little uh farther along into like this neighborhood, and I'm looking for like uh like a market kind of like a a 24-hour like food &gt;&gt; like a bodega type thing. &gt;&gt; Trying to find a bodega. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he's looking for a bodega. Yeah, but it's a it's a it's a boat dega. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. A little a little bodega, if you will. You do see what looks like an overturned like wrecked uh cargo vessel that has been turned into a boat [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] which I'm absolutely gonna write down now. &gt;&gt; Um and outside you see one of those uh constructs which you would know as a war forged. They were robots that were built for the war and some of them still exist. And as you come swimming up it just says like greetings customer. &gt;&gt; Hi. &gt;&gt; What can I do for you? I I'm just looking to uh you know just grab a snack, maybe talk to the owner. &gt;&gt; Uh you are talking to the owner. &gt;&gt; You're construct construct. &gt;&gt; Whoa. Are we just doing that, bro? Like construct property. &gt;&gt; I was saying that it's good. &gt;&gt; What year does this guy think it is? &gt;&gt; Crazy. &gt;&gt; No, that's good. &gt;&gt; It's good to see. It's good to see the constru constructs. It's good to see a construct owning something down here &gt;&gt; is what I meant to say. &gt;&gt; Wow. Okay. &gt;&gt; Is what, &gt;&gt; buddy? All right. &gt;&gt; I I think maybe you just It's not coming out. I'll just take this off. It's probably just &gt;&gt; I clocked from your accent that you are definitely a country elf. Yes. Around here. &gt;&gt; I take the mask. I take the mask off. &gt;&gt; We constructs have rights. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I feel like we got off on the wrong foot &gt;&gt; apparently. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Did the princess hear all that? &gt;&gt; Yeah. She's like, &gt;&gt; you can't just I just &gt;&gt; I just haven't I just haven't seen a construct in I stopped. I I really I cut myself off. I I I take the mask off. I was like, "Do you happen to have any Do you happen to have any water filters on you?" like uh those uh you know those little things that you wear during like underwater construction that like filter the water that you're breathing so you don't get any like a W95. &gt;&gt; You don't get any like bad stuff in the water. You're you're put pushing through your &gt;&gt; Yes. I store them next to the baby pants. &gt;&gt; Like like this guy like I really I'm fishing but kill yourself. He's like, "Yes, we have construction filtered masks for the underwater demolitions and such." Yes. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Make Leo great again. &gt;&gt; Going to go grab I'm going to go grab one of those. Maybe a snack. Selia, &gt;&gt; do not comply. Yes. &gt;&gt; I I'll I'll just grab you a snack in here. Um sir sir, what's your name? &gt;&gt; It's Well, now are you sure that I've got one? I don't see &gt;&gt; You're putting words in my mouth, but yeah. Is this your name, sir? &gt;&gt; You can you can just call me Anchor. &gt;&gt; Okay, I go over to the other side of the store. Just leave this. Like &gt;&gt; Selenia is like, "Oh my god." &gt;&gt; Tough interaction. &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. That's cool. We can We can We can come back from this. We can come back from this. That's um &gt;&gt; You are You are not from here though, huh? Like No, &gt;&gt; it's okay. All right. &gt;&gt; We didn't have a lot of contracts around growing up. &gt;&gt; That's &gt;&gt; Well, they get to live where you are now. That's there's been a social integration of &gt;&gt; constructs. I'm sorry. Also, I understand. &gt;&gt; Did you know like the dead can just live in your neighborhood now? &gt;&gt; Yeah. No, I didn't. We hang out with Ran all the time. I feel like you sort of were like forced to. &gt;&gt; I feel I was just surprised. I haven't been back. I haven't been here in a while. And &gt;&gt; they've misogynated. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh do you want one of these filters? &gt;&gt; I would love to cover my face up. Yes. Absolutely. Yes, please. &gt;&gt; Yeah. wanting anyone to know who I am. &gt;&gt; So, I grabbed two two filters off the rack and uh this is this is a little this is a better snack than what Gorg was talking about. We go over to like the little stand on the other side of the store. This is uh this is a little little uh this this is a little they call this oni giri. Uh they just got these crazy they just got these crazy little like triangles of like uh of like underwater underwater like seaweed and uh it's &gt;&gt; like the sushi is actually fish. They just have them like in little containers &gt;&gt; and they cut up little pieces of fish into it. Great. Don't know where it comes from actually, believe it or not. Not from Leo, but they stock them in the stores. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Delicious. Delicious. And then uh I think you typically unwrap the package, take it out quick. So you take it um and then we like you know just just here like we both take the bite at the same time and then uh and then typically you say you'll say like eat the dakim and take a bite out of it. Don't know why we say that either honestly. &gt;&gt; Uh I go back outside the store and I come back. &gt;&gt; Presumably you pay for all these wares. Correct. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I come back to he gives you change in the uh Leo gold shells. &gt;&gt; Mhm. So, uh, sorry. I feel like I feel like I started things weird. That's my fault. I wanted to ask you, what do you know? I've seen a lot of the people down here look a little sick. We heard something about maybe a little little cold is going around or something. You know anything about that? &gt;&gt; I mean, yeah, there is a little something going around. &gt;&gt; Could you describe the something for me? &gt;&gt; Is it Is it like seasickness that you're asking about? I I've just heard that people are getting really sick all over Leo and I don't know if you if you can tell I'm a terin and I've been sent here to to figure it out. So when you say that you're a pterodin and short of showing me your identification, he definitely like stands up a little straighter and he goes, "Ah, yes, of course. We have a vested interest in law enforcement." You know, back of the tea. Yeah. &gt;&gt; A pterodin flag. &gt;&gt; What are you trying to get it for free? &gt;&gt; Back of the door. &gt;&gt; Of course. Shells on the flag. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Yeah. But it's a very thin. &gt;&gt; I kind of like like look off like behind his shoulder for a second and I realize that, you know, the interaction is kind of turned in my favor now. Even though I don't really like the, you know, the direction he's going in, I realize that this works to my advantage. Yeah. And I just kind of stand up a little straighter, &gt;&gt; right? And he's like, "Well, yes, I have seen some things." And as he sort of like leans in and begins to talk in hush tones up at the table. &gt;&gt; I'm wearing a top hat now and I have a cane. [Music] &gt;&gt; Man, someone's really about to beat me. I'm feeling it. &gt;&gt; Hey, come on. Hey. Hey. Oh, lady, look at you. Just like that. &gt;&gt; And then you do see a very weathered old sea elf who is like, "Oh, all I've got is my husband's pension from the war." &gt;&gt; Close to the end of your life, but insane riches. Come on up. &gt;&gt; See me through. &gt;&gt; From which war? &gt;&gt; Oh, you know the the conflict with with you know those that we don't speak of. Right out there in those waters, my Henry paid the ultimate sacrifice. But &gt;&gt; that's so sad. Why don't you get up and play against our please? Beautiful woman. &gt;&gt; I also served in the war. &gt;&gt; You don't look old enough to observed in the war. &gt;&gt; I'm ashamed to admit, but I won't let you play this game. It's um Well, let's just say it's not for older women. &gt;&gt; Oh, that Okay. I mean, you sure? Because I'm prepared to get &gt;&gt; Are you Are you sure, dude? She's so rich. Like, this is &gt;&gt; from the war. You know how I feel about the war. &gt;&gt; It's one of the things that I bring up the most. &gt;&gt; Probably he only uses it to obuscate and detach if I ever wager again. &gt;&gt; Made a really good point. &gt;&gt; He's doing it right now. Actually, &gt;&gt; look, there's plenty of suckers out here. Hey, step right up. Step right up. Step right up. Are you swinging your gang? Yeah, you you see the old woman says, "Well, you know, I think you're not such a bad guy after all." &gt;&gt; Well, if you were about, you know, 50 years younger looking, I wouldn't mind taking you out. &gt;&gt; I I I think you mean that as a compliment, but okay. &gt;&gt; I don't talk to women a lot, but yeah. &gt;&gt; And she she turns and she's like, "Oh, um, I'm going to show you a magic trick. Are you ready?" &gt;&gt; Uh, sure. Yeah. Make it quick. We got a lot of paid customers trying to beat the old veteran. &gt;&gt; I want you to count to three and then look in the coin purse. And she turns and starts walking away. &gt;&gt; Uh, one 2 three. &gt;&gt; Do you look in there? Uh, there is both double the money that you expected and also your wallet. Like your wallet has been taken and put in the bag. &gt;&gt; Oh, like she [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] David blamed me. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Wait, but what's in my ass? No. Is it Friday already? &gt;&gt; When When you look up, she's she's gone. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Friday. While he's trying to figure it out, I got an orphan that wants to play against you. Come on. I I think we shut down for the day. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Well, &gt;&gt; dude, we're drowning in it. &gt;&gt; I'm a bystander. That's &gt;&gt; No, I think I figure it out. Figure it out. &gt;&gt; I think you do, too, sir. Why don't you step right up? &gt;&gt; He goes left and then center and then right. He goes in the same order every time. It's middle right here. We'll figure it out this time. Gor, I think I think we cut tail. I think we spend this. &gt;&gt; I got some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I need to buy anyway. &gt;&gt; It's a two-man operation. If you don't want to do it, I won't I won't force you. &gt;&gt; We'll spend it. &gt;&gt; All right, let's spend it. Let's shut this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] down. &gt;&gt; I flick a gold shell to the orphan and I &gt;&gt; I catch it right before it right before it lands in his hand and I pocket it. &gt;&gt; It's like that that lighthouse of Horizon. The beam just comes down and like like the ISR on across the the deck there and moves back up. &gt;&gt; I just I just catch that. Put in my pocket. &gt;&gt; Um yeah, I want to get a new armor set for Coots. &gt;&gt; Sounds good. Let's do it. I get half right. &gt;&gt; You do get like 30% 100%. &gt;&gt; We're going to do this &gt;&gt; without me without my without my aura which we've established through the rules of the world that I have. It is the ultimate confidence scam to be like, I just feel good around this guy. Push. &gt;&gt; Do you feel good around you? &gt;&gt; You give you half. &gt;&gt; Okay. Maybe we save 10% on the side &gt;&gt; for the boys. &gt;&gt; For the boys. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And then go 455. &gt;&gt; Did you guys pack it up? &gt;&gt; You sure you don't want this guy? in in the tent when you hit the button on the sending stone for a moment there there is silence and then you hear a voice just say uh and to whom do I have the pleasure of speaking with? &gt;&gt; Uh John uh Ron Paladus. &gt;&gt; Ah well it seems like our money to Karan was well spent. I would say give her our uh thanks, but um she's probably already absconded. &gt;&gt; Uh is that word is what does that mean? Does that mean &gt;&gt; it means she took her money and ran? &gt;&gt; Oh um okay. So you found me. Um what now? What? &gt;&gt; You just wanted to talk. &gt;&gt; Well, who who are you? &gt;&gt; You can call me Bowman. &gt;&gt; Bowman? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Okay. Uh uh Bowman. Uh what do you need from me? Oh, I don't need anything from you, sir. Um, I just wish to talk, &gt;&gt; right? About what? I feel like we're doing the same thing a lot. About what? &gt;&gt; Listen, um, I realized recently some events have come to light that you may have been a party to. There may be information that you possess um that I am sympathet. &gt;&gt; Yes. Um, what do you intend to do with that about that? &gt;&gt; I don't know. What do you not want me to do? &gt;&gt; Well, let me um I tell you what, we're doing this dance. You all right? We are sort of going in circles and one of us has to exert a little bit of trust. Um, I represent an organization that has a vested interest in the truth coming to light. Are you at the crossroads? &gt;&gt; I am. Oh. I was told by my God that I need to figure out what you're up to. &gt;&gt; Oh, well, praise be to the creeping night that he has such an interest in us in our movies. &gt;&gt; CK, &gt;&gt; you know, &gt;&gt; no, &gt;&gt; there is a uh no Louie. No, Louie. You know, there there are no small member of citizens of Mory amongst our number there. We have representatives from all five of the kingdoms that you're aware of and even the kingdoms that you are not yet aware of. &gt;&gt; I have a question for you. &gt;&gt; Please. &gt;&gt; Who is in charge of the Pterodin at the very top? &gt;&gt; Do you know? &gt;&gt; Unfortunately, I don't and I would like to. &gt;&gt; Okay. Is that your main goal? &gt;&gt; We have a number of goals and for now I would just like to say um do please enjoy the seaweed. It was &gt;&gt; my G. Yeah, &gt;&gt; was an I appreciated that part. &gt;&gt; Vintage. Listen, Ron, we have no interest in you betraying the trust of your friends or your oath to the Pterodin. We just would like you to keep your eyes open and perhaps you and I can have more conversations in the future. &gt;&gt; Okay. Anything to keep my eye open in particular for &gt;&gt; I think you're a smart man and you can make those decisions for yourself. &gt;&gt; I am a smart man. &gt;&gt; You are. &gt;&gt; Thank you for identifying that. Let's see. You are smart as well as &gt;&gt; If there was a dumb man in the room, what would you maybe tell them to look out for? &gt;&gt; Were we speaking to York? To Gorg. &gt;&gt; If we were speaking to Gorg the turtle. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's um while you are there in Leo, maybe ask around a little bit about the formation of Leo. Often times people lose track of why that kingdom even exists and why it is there. &gt;&gt; Ah, some activism. &gt;&gt; Get the question stirring in their heads &gt;&gt; a little bit. &gt;&gt; I see. Yes. &gt;&gt; Uh, and all the weed is free. &gt;&gt; I I can keep it. &gt;&gt; Yes. Was like credit card. &gt;&gt; Absolutely not. No, that is all for you. Listen. Um, your people will tell you that we are terrorists. We simply believe we're revolutionaries. I suppose history will have to sort out the difference. &gt;&gt; Can I tell my fellow Pterodin that we spoke? &gt;&gt; I leave it up to you. I will only say there is a reason why we contacted you and not them. &gt;&gt; It's because you know of my book. You think that I could write to the press in a way that convinces people on mass of &gt;&gt; We have no record of you having written a book. Is is it a memoir? Is it a sort of &gt;&gt; I maybe I thought you like maybe like God or some kind of weird all knowing. Never mind. Yeah. I haven't written a book. Um yeah. Okay. I Well, I got your stone stone. You can't see me right now. I don't think I have I'm holding it I have your stone. &gt;&gt; Yes. And are stoned from the sound of it. &gt;&gt; Let's go. Um and uh Yeah. Okay. I'll keep an eye keep an eye out. &gt;&gt; We just like to speak again in the future. &gt;&gt; One more question. &gt;&gt; Yes. Say as many as you want. &gt;&gt; Why Why does uh why does Karana have like a big wound on her neck? &gt;&gt; Oh, I think she was just putting on a face that you would find pleasing. &gt;&gt; Dude, Ron has to be the dumbest [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] The the seaweed is the seaweed is stiff, man. The seaweed is stiff &gt;&gt; all day. &gt;&gt; Yeah. No, no, it's like one moment. She's there, but then she leaves and she's replaced with this redhead lady. &gt;&gt; He also happens to her. &gt;&gt; He's He's He's on that. &gt;&gt; I'm hearing voices. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; they're so mean. &gt;&gt; The loud guy got hearing voices. &gt;&gt; Just to be clear, I don't trust you. I don't trust anyone. &gt;&gt; No, you shouldn't. You shouldn't. &gt;&gt; I don't trust myself. Well, trust me. &gt;&gt; I don't even trust my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] my effing mom. I don't even effing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] trust my mom. &gt;&gt; Mr. Bean could talk. &gt;&gt; There's a reason why he doesn't &gt;&gt; right. Okay. Actually, I know I said bye. Do we have one more question? Um, what is going around here? Cuz I have seen people looking pretty. &gt;&gt; He doesn't respond. &gt;&gt; Hello. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Okay. All right. Well, onward. Meanwhile, back in the ocean, he sort of leans in and he says, "Well, it's been going for about a month now. Some of the people coming back to port were um reporting some cold symptoms, which of course, walk it off. We're a tough lot. I myself, I'm not biological, so I'm especially not concerned." But then it just started to get worse and worse and worse, and people started dropping into comas and then dying. &gt;&gt; How many people have died? dozens that I have heard, perhaps more that I have not heard. I don't range too far from the shop here. &gt;&gt; Is it Do they know anything about how it's spreading or where it started from? &gt;&gt; He just like points at the mask and he's like, "Well, I guess you've got some thoughts on that." I mean, like, &gt;&gt; it's a precaution. &gt;&gt; It's a precaution. It's &gt;&gt; just a cold. It's a herd immunity, I've been told, is our our saving grace to all of this. &gt;&gt; We call it school immunity. We're largely aquatic. &gt;&gt; Is it? You know, you see a lot of beans down here. You &gt;&gt; Is that slang for something? &gt;&gt; That's got to be racist, bro. Beans. &gt;&gt; You see a lot of different &gt;&gt; Oh my god. You cannot call those people behing [Music] like &gt;&gt; is is this infecting certain beings? Is this infecting certain type types of uh uh like is it only humans or sea elves or &gt;&gt; it's the mask again? &gt;&gt; He's like beings. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to annunciate I'm trying to annunciate. I'm taking precautions. You do. You Is there like a Is there any sort of like creature or being down here that's not being infected besides yourself? Of course. He's like, "The illness does not seem to be discriminating." &gt;&gt; And do you did it originate? It You said it came into port one day. &gt;&gt; You said it started with some people that just uh just came in on a ship or some people that came from the water. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And just to clarify, are you going to buy anymore or are we just &gt;&gt; Well, I bought some things already, &gt;&gt; right? But I I believe we we have we have &gt;&gt; I've been waiting for 20 [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] minutes on the level. &gt;&gt; What happened to back? &gt;&gt; What happened to backing the tea? &gt;&gt; Sure, but um there is a numerous people behind you. &gt;&gt; I back the tea, but I just need I need to get groceries. &gt;&gt; Hold on a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] second. &gt;&gt; Whoa. &gt;&gt; You see Selen's like, "Okay, um sorry everyone. Um we're just going to She's like, Leoness." &gt;&gt; All right. Thank you, sir. Appreciate your support. &gt;&gt; Tease up. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Tease up. &gt;&gt; Tease up. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; It's not really my thing. &gt;&gt; And then I look at the guy in the back of the line. Tease up. &gt;&gt; We leave the store. &gt;&gt; On the way out, you you very much hear like an aging sea elf be like, &gt;&gt; "Back in my day, ain't no terror den going to wear a mask. They they done woke up at the pteroden. Yeah, Selena. Uh, I'm going to be honest with you. I'm going to keep this on. Uh, cuz we just I just can't get any answers out of these people. &gt;&gt; She She just grabs you and like hugs you around the neck and she's like, "What is going on with you? &gt;&gt; This this I know it's it's been it's been a rough little while, but the guy I met was not this guy." &gt;&gt; Am I crazy? I feel like I'm going insane. I feel like people they told us that there was a plague here. There's a disease that's spreading. He just told us people are dying and I'm the one getting made fun of. &gt;&gt; Meanwhile, back up on the shore. Uh what kind of stuff are you guys out to buy? Cuz again, this is the kind of place that you can get a little of everything. &gt;&gt; I'm walking by. We're walking. I have a bowl of &gt;&gt; It's so good. It's so fresh. &gt;&gt; And I'm like, "You sure you're wondering?" And I'm with a mouthful of seafood. I'm I ask him, "So Brad, do you think we're cops?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. We're making our way over to a pub and we already we already got our stuff. &gt;&gt; We got bags. &gt;&gt; You got armor. &gt;&gt; I got I got shiny new armor, but it all I didn't realize when it's reflected in the sun, hues pink. &gt;&gt; And so it looks silver, but in the sun it's just it's just so I'm just pink walking around. I go, "Yeah, &gt;&gt; we're cops. Is that cool?" &gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; I like going to war. &gt;&gt; I think about it sometimes. &gt;&gt; I've killed so many dogs. And and you see Kagod comes walking up and she says, "Hey, first of all, I love this. This this is good." You blend in now with the people and the terror. We are not a cops. We are peacekeepers. We have &gt;&gt; peacekeepers. That's what they tell me. I forgot. Yeah. Peacekeepers. &gt;&gt; This is what we are. &gt;&gt; We keep peace. Sometimes dogs are in peace. &gt;&gt; Do you think that &gt;&gt; I mean, as a cat person, I'm also like, "Yes, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the dogs." Yes, they're right. Exactly. &gt;&gt; And I'm just chewing. And I'm like, do you think there's like a systemic issue that we're maybe like contributing to sometimes? &gt;&gt; Check it out. I got a new hat. &gt;&gt; Look at the hat. He's looking great. And Ran, you arrive. Ran, give me a con save. Ran. &gt;&gt; Oh, nine. &gt;&gt; Weed's loud. Ran, &gt;&gt; you find them. But &gt;&gt; where we go? &gt;&gt; Um, what? Where were you? Where were you? You left. You said, "Hey, &gt;&gt; I'm here right now." &gt;&gt; Bro, we ran a scam. It was crazy. There was an orphan I took from him. &gt;&gt; Excuse me. Maybe you do not confess to the crimes in public. &gt;&gt; Well, no, it wasn't a scam. I'm just It was a fair card game and we happen to win more than lose. You said you went to a shop for dead people. Where's the stuff? &gt;&gt; Um, is that what's in there? Ice cream. &gt;&gt; Oh, no. This Do you want to try it? &gt;&gt; Oh, it's so good. It's like spicy. He tried. &gt;&gt; I didn't think it'd be good. In my head, I'm like, did he say a normal word or did he say that word? &gt;&gt; Uh, okay. Um, what did I just I had a call. I called someone. I learned it's gone. &gt;&gt; Hey, Ron, do you think we're cops? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, a little bit. &gt;&gt; Kind of the whole job. &gt;&gt; Think about that. &gt;&gt; I'd like to talk to counselor Barrist. Is that possible? Uh Barristan is in a different kingdom. He's in Tennela. Uh this is uh the people that are in charge here are the captains. Uh Allar Stormchaser and Rook. Yeah. Captain Stormchaser. &gt;&gt; Um you see uh Catagod looks at you and she's like, "Yes, I I will I will take you to the Um where is Leoness?" Oh, did he sneak away for a moment with that cute girl? &gt;&gt; Yeah, probably. He was going underwater with that girl and &gt;&gt; he's being so awkward, but I think it is cute. &gt;&gt; I don't think it's cute. I think he's pathetic. &gt;&gt; I think he's just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] footing around too much and if he just kind of gripped her and said, "I like you." They might make some some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, but like consensually with the gripping like, you know, like they show, &gt;&gt; right? But but it's like, oh, like sometimes you do just want to be taken like, "Oh, I just I'd like you to." Yes, I understand. &gt;&gt; Oh, the firm loving grip. You know, he's like Leo is the most beautiful damn place in this whole damn world. And he's he's probably [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it all up. He's probably saying something weird. &gt;&gt; I reach out and touch your shirt and you don't think I can see I don't think you can see me doing it. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. That's &gt;&gt; Are you growing it or wearing it? &gt;&gt; We both We're going to a pub. We're getting coffee. Yes. &gt;&gt; Right now. Maybe I will I will go look I will go look for Leon into the water. &gt;&gt; That' be nice. We'll be at the pub. &gt;&gt; He'll be at the pub. &gt;&gt; He's always not wearing your shirt. &gt;&gt; This You have been partially nude this entire time. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; But you can get a nice pink garment like he has gotten. &gt;&gt; It's not pink. It's silver. It just shines. &gt;&gt; Dude, it's a hue. It's a shiny hue. &gt;&gt; Pink shirt. Looks &gt;&gt; the way it reflects in this area. &gt;&gt; Well, it's armor, but it's pink. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's pink. And you see she stops for a second and then she looks at you and she's like, "Would you like a hug?" &gt;&gt; Uh yeah, that's &gt;&gt; like when she hugs you, she sort of nuzzles you and you hear this deep like &gt;&gt; Yeah. She's like, "Okay, that one's on the house. Only the one though." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Do we have like a sexual thing? Was that like a &gt;&gt; That's No, you're just very high. And she like turns and walks towards the railing that you guys are on and she jumps off and you see her turn into a seagull and fly about 50 ft and then just like turn into a seal and like down into the water. &gt;&gt; Did you guys see that? &gt;&gt; Yeah, she can do that. I can't do that. &gt;&gt; She actually just walked away. Whatever you saw is fake. I don't know. &gt;&gt; No, she was like three holes. It was &gt;&gt; a She doesn't She can't transform. &gt;&gt; Where's the Where's the uh the gay one? Meanwhile, under the water, uh, she's like, "What is going on with you?" Yeah. Okay. Yes. Yes. You're making sense. Everybody else is not taking this seriously. And something that is probably would have been easily rectified with just a little bit of cooperation is going to blow massively out of proportion from people being selfish asses. &gt;&gt; It does. It does feel like that. &gt;&gt; But you being weird's not going to motivate anybody. &gt;&gt; I'm like thinking in my head, she thinks I'm weird. I think you're acting weird. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; it's not the same as you are weird. You're acting weird. I like weird. &gt;&gt; I like weird. I got killed like a week ago. &gt;&gt; Nothing makes sense. &gt;&gt; You're right. I think I need to relax a little. It doesn't matter what people say about me wearing this. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; I think maybe &gt;&gt; you could literally secure your own oxygen first. I feel like let's head back on up and find the rest of the rest of the guys cuz I think we at least have somewhere to start with, you know, the the cost of what's happening and maybe there's somebody with a little more authority we can talk to or maybe a hospital that we can go see what the what the damage is. You want to come up with me? &gt;&gt; She's like, I want to be wherever you are. and you need a little &gt;&gt; and right when she says that you hear I will ain't that sweet. She wants to be wherever you are. Problem is, mate. And you see four of those guys covered in like seaweed and coral just kind of like come walking out of an alley and he's like, "You've been asking a bit too many questions here. So, uh, I think we're going to have to kill all you." And they all start drawing weapons and Selenia looks at you and she goes, "You see the shadows form?" And she's like, "Now, now is a good time." &gt;&gt; And that is a good place for us to stop. [Music]
