 Minks in barricade turn and look right at you and go. &gt;&gt; If it drops you to zero, you will die. &gt;&gt; That's so bad. &gt;&gt; Cockhead looks at you and she says, &gt;&gt; "I'll let you decide which one of them to kill cuz you have been charmed." A turtle woman with comically large breasts. I turned into that. Welcome. She was betrayed. Who? Go get I swear. Hello and welcome to the fifth episode of The Yard D and D. And I realize there's a nonzero chance I said the last time was the fifth episode, but this is for sure the fifth episode. &gt;&gt; We do that all the time. Yeah. On the podcast, we say it's episode 100. Basically, every episode. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Welcome to the hundth episode. Episode &gt;&gt; right 100. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh I am BD Walters Jedlaged Reanimated Corpse. So when last we met uh you all had pursued Ketria through a hallway that you found in the Nexus after she had kidnapped Princess Selenia. Uh you realized that there was wreckage from the previous conflict, the Great War that theoretically shouldn't have existed, and you all went to an outpost that none of you quite remembered, although &gt;&gt; found out later that you had been before. Uh you learned that the Elven Wildfire Brigade uh which Stone Beard had served a part of when he or at least had uh liazed with when he was a younger Gith Yonke uh and even a previous living life ran Kaledus had been present for were holding the line at the edge of the battlefield waiting for operation anvil and hammer where a weapon was supposed to be unleashed that would deliver the final defeat of the unspoken one. And one of the things that you learned in the presence of your flashback is basically the weapon got unleashed before they had a chance to retreat. And that these vampires and restless dead were essentially soldiers just like you who'd given their lives and had not quite been able to find their rest afterwards. After the battle with Ketria, she surrendered. She said, "Well, now that you know the truth, there's nothing left to fight about." Uh, and you all said she should not turn herself in just yet until you all had some chance to uh do some investigating, ask some questions. She gave you a sending stone so you can communicate with her and said that basically when you say turn yourself in, she would. Uh, you also successfully returned with Princess Selenia, although she had been slightly altered, now being a dumpier, a half vampire, and having gained access to some sort of shadow sorcery. However, time has passed since then. Uh, you all have come back to the Nexus. Uh, and if you would all of you roll a d20 for me. Just a regular d20. &gt;&gt; I rolled a two. &gt;&gt; God damn it. &gt;&gt; We're doing our own stunts here. &gt;&gt; Let's do this. 12 15 &gt;&gt; 12 15 &gt;&gt; four two 15. What you been doing? What you been doing uh since you came back? &gt;&gt; Well, uh, you know what? I've leveled up. I have something now called uh what's it called, Dave? Uh you you have your paladin aura has activated now. You have aura of protection. &gt;&gt; It can't be phrased specific way. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Aura of protection. We're just being around you. &gt;&gt; What about a shield instead of aura &gt;&gt; within 10 ft of you? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; You just give buffs just when you're very present. &gt;&gt; So I have aura. Uh I I would call it additional aura. Uh which is very cool and I've been enjoying that. And not only me, but my friends have been enjoying that because of what it gives you as a buff. So, I've been good. We've been being chilling, loving life back in the Nexus with your wife still or &gt;&gt; uh not a wife. So, your baby mama &gt;&gt; Shoji Show the Magnificent. Show the Magnificent. Um the mother of your child uh GJ Gorg Jr. &gt;&gt; I don't think my kid should be out with me because I could die and then they could eat my kid. &gt;&gt; Why would they? &gt;&gt; Correct. I would eat my kid. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Sorry. If I die in battle, if I if I kill a turtle in battle valiantly, it's hard cuz they're hard to kill and then he's a delicious like snack beast. &gt;&gt; It's delicious &gt;&gt; because people we do we not eat goats. &gt;&gt; Just for everyone uh who might not remember GJ Gorg Jr. is a pseudo dragon. She's a little dragon about the size of a cat that he is describing as clearly about snack size. see my cat in the real world and think yummy. &gt;&gt; No, because your snack piece is made out of machine. Yeah, made out of &gt;&gt; what real world? Immerse yourself, Broadway, you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] It's &gt;&gt; true. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Sorry. I was thinking about I was thinking about my charact. Yeah. &gt;&gt; No, no. Okay. Exiting this. I don't think about eating your pets, but I think if if it were like zombie apocalypse, maybe I would. And that's what I think about Gueorg. I get concerned. It makes me worried. &gt;&gt; Also, do you think Ran died a virgin? &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; I'm I'm dead already. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, &gt;&gt; yeah, that's what he's saying before that &gt;&gt; you here with this time now when Shi comes knocking cuz she's going to &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Would you would you have let her in? &gt;&gt; I mean, it's the mother of my damn child. &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; you can't just you can't just say no to that. &gt;&gt; So, fast forward to the next day. Uh the room is a bit of a wreck. You're sort of in a tangle of the ruin of your bed cuz she's way heavier than she looks. &gt;&gt; Don't Don't tell her that. &gt;&gt; Brownish red skin and bright &gt;&gt; bridge of a baby mama. &gt;&gt; You're way heavier than you look. &gt;&gt; No, babe. You're just dense. &gt;&gt; You're dense. Yeah, you're a dart. &gt;&gt; She's dense. No, she knows what she is. Uh is sort of laying there with you one day and she says to you, Gorg, what do you mean she looks delicious? That's a weird thing to say, man, because you also are very small relative to me and I would call you a snack, but not delicious. &gt;&gt; Because I'm saying like if I look, there's barbaric monsters out there, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; All right. They'll eat anything and they come across my helpless, defenses little cute ass daughter baby dragon cat, they're going to be like, "Let's cook it up for lunch." &gt;&gt; Okay. No, but just to make sure that I'm following you, your concern is not that you actively go into combat with your child and that she might get hurt. &gt;&gt; This is what we're trying to tell him. &gt;&gt; Your concern is that only in the event that you die and presumably your associates die that she would get caught and eaten. &gt;&gt; Yes. Because she's in my shell. She's in there packed up tight, which I still I still think is a bad idea, but if we're all there &gt;&gt; Well, but it was your idea. So, &gt;&gt; I think we we have to call like DPS or something. &gt;&gt; Okay. Um, you know what? Um, you know what? My my cave is set up. I can take her back with me. It's fine. &gt;&gt; I think that's a good idea right now. I think &gt;&gt; I think I'm going through I'm dealing with I'm doing a lot of stuff with my career. The lawyer. &gt;&gt; Oh, wait a second. You're telling me you're not ready to be a father? &gt;&gt; I'm That's not what I'm saying at all. I'm just saying. &gt;&gt; Right. and she reaches out and even though she just looks like a normalsized woman, she sort of grabs you right by the front of the shell and lifts you completely up and looks at you and she's like cuz that's not that isn't what you're saying to me though, right? That's not &gt;&gt; I think okay, yes, maybe I'm not ready and maybe when I am ready I'll be a good father. &gt;&gt; And she puts you down and she's like well unfortunately she's here so we got to work this out. That's Hey, because look, I'm not trying to be that girl, you know? I'm not trying to be like, oh, you and I got to have a thing because our thing gave rise to to this, but also, I need you to understand something, Gorg. While I don't have to force you to be a husband or even a boyfriend or even a partner, you see flames sort of start to like play along the edges of her lips a little bit. She's like, "I also don't have to let you live." So, we just got to we got to work this out, brother. We got to work this out. All right. So, I'm going to take her with me. &gt;&gt; I will. Yes, I will. &gt;&gt; Because you're right that she shouldn't &gt;&gt; our our child should not go into active battles. &gt;&gt; I'm warrior fight. &gt;&gt; But when you kind of pass through here, we're going to &gt;&gt; we're going to work it out. All right. &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Did you get a little turtle boner, which I love? &gt;&gt; It's like like little cobra. is like there's there's there's Jor little York. Little York. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Good news is we still got the sitter for a couple more hours. So, you know, &gt;&gt; I'm not in the mood. &gt;&gt; Oh, you're not in the mood to smite again. &gt;&gt; Let's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] go. &gt;&gt; That's okay. That's cool. I understand. Um I'm going to go pick up the baby. I'm going to head out. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate you. I appreciate you and you're in my life and I appreciate you and I appreciate our child and I appreciate Horizon. &gt;&gt; I I understand what this is. It's just &gt;&gt; we got Hey, hey, hey, &gt;&gt; there's more at stake now than just what you and I want. Okay, &gt;&gt; that's what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; That's that's that's all I'm saying. &gt;&gt; I agree. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And she doesn't lean out and just kind of like kisses you on the top of the head. She's like, &gt;&gt; "You still got it though." &gt;&gt; I know. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh I think the next one up was that like I think a 12 over there I believe. Same thing. Uh Rome just just what you've been doing again. You guys came back to the Nexus and you know been doing &gt;&gt; what I've been doing. Um well well I'm uh it's stupid you guys wouldn't care. I'm I'm writing a book. &gt;&gt; I care. &gt;&gt; Whoa. &gt;&gt; What's the book about? &gt;&gt; Well, I haven't I haven't started it. So I have notes about the book. So, it's about um it's about a guy who's dead and then a girl falls in love with him and shut up. You can't laugh. &gt;&gt; They're not even there. This is &gt;&gt; I've never written a book. &gt;&gt; This is my first time. &gt;&gt; No, Leonus showed me his ball sack again. It was It's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hilarious. Don't do that. &gt;&gt; We all think it's really good. &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, it's about it's about a guy who's dead and he falls in love with &gt;&gt; about a guy who's dead and he falls in love with a girl &gt;&gt; and her kiss brings him back to life. It's it's &gt;&gt; it's just &gt;&gt; I haven't finished it. It's like it's still I haven't I haven't finished. &gt;&gt; We haven't started it either. &gt;&gt; Well, it's it's still that's why it needs work. It's I'm I'm currently reading the hero's journey which is in this world too. I don't have any thoughts because this is this is narrative exposition and I'm not here listening to you right now. So I don't have any &gt;&gt; know you don't have any thoughts. I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; So here here &gt;&gt; cutting I'm sorry cutting words just in me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Here here's the thing Ran. I mean you are not just a bard. You're a lore bard. You're a thinking man's bard. So uh this is what I would like you to do. Uh roll performance for me. Let's just see how good this book is getting started. Oh, &gt;&gt; while you're looking at this, I should say out loud, yes, they have leveled up. Some of them have gained some specific new powers, which I will say at the time, uh, some people just gain more spell slots. What'd you get? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Not 20. So, dude, &gt;&gt; you know, &gt;&gt; this shit's going to go crazy. &gt;&gt; This is kind of something, Ran. This is This is &gt;&gt; I was thinking page one is just like your eyes are like the ocean. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, like just like right off the bat, something that's like hard-hitting. like crystal blue like the ocean. &gt;&gt; Shall I compare thee? &gt;&gt; Like a slam poem. I want to open with like a slam like it plays a audio slam. &gt;&gt; The only problem is you keep having to stop cuz the quill and parchment keeps catching on fire like &gt;&gt; I'm like the I'm not like the most deaf of &gt;&gt; Yeah. Like the D and D world. &gt;&gt; I I need to know and I need you to know this is going to be canon. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I need the title of the story. Oh my god. I'm going to do you a favor. I'm going let you think. I'm gonna let you. You already got it. I got it. &gt;&gt; You already got it. What's the title of the story? &gt;&gt; I It came in a vid. The Life Between Us, &gt;&gt; Dave. The Life Between Us. &gt;&gt; Done. &gt;&gt; I'm not kidding. The front page is a broken heart emoji. &gt;&gt; He's up for El Pulitzer this year. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; I mean, it it kind of crashes though, R. Like, even as you read back coverage, &gt;&gt; honestly, the title's not even on the front page. &gt;&gt; It's just a broken heart emoji on the cover and then the first page says the tattoos and open it up to see &gt;&gt; what's that all about. &gt;&gt; What's it about? &gt;&gt; I have a lot of 12-year-old fans. I &gt;&gt; We got emojis of the Nexus. &gt;&gt; Really love that. &gt;&gt; Honestly, I kind of I kind of write it off in my head. It's not even &gt;&gt; They're in the scrolls. I see. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I cannot top uh The Life Between Us. &gt;&gt; 26 after my bonus, by the way. &gt;&gt; Roll uh a D8 for me. Yeah, that one. Roll that one for me. &gt;&gt; Is that how much money he earns in millions? &gt;&gt; Takes about four days for you to start seeing your first broken heart tattoo. like on on somebody's neck. &gt;&gt; Hard. &gt;&gt; Yeah. On on Elf on Elf X. I'm like, "Wow, love it. Thanks for the support." &gt;&gt; Oh, my daughter's going to be reading this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] trash and she's going to be like, "Oh, I love I can't wait for the movie." &gt;&gt; She's like, "It's not a phase, Dad. It's not a phase." Your daughter will not be able to read till she's 17. &gt;&gt; My daughter's amazing. And then there was a four in it, too, I think, over here. Same thing, Stone Beard. And I I should say out loud, you have gained um &gt;&gt; even more physical durability. Like it is even harder to kill Stone Beard now. What you been up to, man? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, you know, actually things are pretty rough after that last fight cuz you know, I was there. I didn't know what happened. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; So, it's kind of warped my view of who I am and and a lot of my personal values. So, I actually quit drinking. All right. Keep throwing his balls to us. It's crazy. &gt;&gt; What if anything fills that void for Stone Beard? &gt;&gt; Uh, I don't want the guys to know. &gt;&gt; I've been reading lately. &gt;&gt; Have you been reading Underground Hit, The Life Between Us? &gt;&gt; I got an early copy and it's actually just like a manuscript. So, it looks like a blank like almost like a notebook, &gt;&gt; a memoir. &gt;&gt; It doesn't have the emoji on the front, but it is The Life Between Us. And I'm I'm eating that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. &gt;&gt; I'm eating that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up cuz I mean the hours I used to fill a drink, I don't take up time. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, and I'm still I'm still at the bar. Like I'm still around it cuz I want to like kind of be used to it, but I but I drink there. And most people don't know that I'm not drinking. I'm not like telling people I'm not drinking. So I I have like a big old ale, but it's like &gt;&gt; right is juice. &gt;&gt; Calamity's in on the joke. Hang on. Now, now I need to know. &gt;&gt; Is Stone Beard aware that Ran wrote that? Right. No clue. &gt;&gt; Did you write it under Ran Kalades or did you use a pen name? I have a pen name. &gt;&gt; I also need the pen name. I'll let you think about it. I'll let you think about it. I I do need the pen name though. I do. And as you were sitting there sort of nursing this ale, drinking, Calamity kind of comes up to you and she goes, "What chapter are you up to, darling? Cuz I got to tell you, chapter 4 had me up last night balling like a newborn hatchling. &gt;&gt; Chapter 4, it's a life changer. &gt;&gt; There's something about the author. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Like someone that worldly and sensitive. &gt;&gt; They they they must have lived so many lives &gt;&gt; to have told these stories. &gt;&gt; Many lives. I would I would love to meet such a kind and gentle that name. I have the name of the the author. It's Jonathan Pork. JP's way of using words. I like I would I would kill to just sit with him for like an hour. &gt;&gt; I don't have any tattoos again as a cobalt. She's only about 4 feet tall. She's like, "Uh, my body is a temple, but if I were to, I would just get a broken heart with a J and a P on it. It's just &gt;&gt; Oh, well, also um I brought in that um special ale that you've been requesting that it's it is too much for the common man and it is the stone beard special. It is very much top that off there. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Cheers. &gt;&gt; Hey, cheers. Cheers. &gt;&gt; Zone Beard. Zone Beard, you saved all of us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We miss Riley. &gt;&gt; Yeah. They were like, "But screw Bjorn, though." &gt;&gt; Well, Bujorn was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. &gt;&gt; No. No. We're better off without that guy &gt;&gt; coming to a &gt;&gt; coming back to my battle notes. &gt;&gt; Yeah, perfect. And last but not least, uh Leonus, what you been up to? &gt;&gt; Well, you know, in my mind, we had a we were assigned a mission and it never really, you know, the mission didn't end. Somebody has to keep up with the princess every day. Somebody's got to make sure that she's all right. So, I wake up I wake up early every morning and I go, you know, I go kind of to the little to the little bushes, the little park outside like where she's staying in the Nexus. &gt;&gt; And then I just kind of keep an eye on her like the whole day. &gt;&gt; Like, that's cool, man. &gt;&gt; I keep it keep it at a distance cuz I don't wouldn't want her to be overwhelmed. &gt;&gt; But I got to make sure that the princess stays safe cuz we've been back and we saw a lot of dangerous [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; We got to keep an eye on her. We got to keep it. We got to keep it probably. &gt;&gt; It's not It's not stalking if she's into it. Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; And she And does she know? &gt;&gt; Give me stealth. Roll stealth for me. &gt;&gt; This is an important role, man. &gt;&gt; Do you want stealth? Does he want a high roll? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You want high roll. &gt;&gt; This is a bad look. If it's a low roll, bro. &gt;&gt; I rolled. &gt;&gt; I rolled a one. &gt;&gt; Dude, that's crazy. It's you you know there there was um there were tales of of of a Goliath uh named uh Shaquille and he was famous for an image of him behind a little tree where you could sort of see him on both sides of it. Um, and it's that, but worsely, honestly, because you're blue, &gt;&gt; so it is like you're kind of conspicuous. And you see one day she's walking with her handler and she just sort of like scratches her head and points in your direction. And you hear like she's speaking next to you. Uh, are you hiding? [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Thim thimble bail me on this one, &gt;&gt; bro. Thimble behind a little bush on your shoulder. &gt;&gt; Thimble is she th is she talking to somebody else? &gt;&gt; Thimble is like got besides the fact that he looks like a forest creature to begin with is like got green pasted on him. I mean like he's gone into it and he's like, &gt;&gt; "Bro, you are a ghost. There's no way she sees you." &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So, I just stay quiet. &gt;&gt; Cuz she doesn't see me. I don't think she sees me. &gt;&gt; You see, she just looks your direction and then she makes a big show of being like, "Oh, I thought I saw someone. I must have been mistaken." &gt;&gt; I put my finger out to dab thimble up. &gt;&gt; He's like, "You're like special forces, bro. It's like death from a distance. &gt;&gt; You learn when you've been to so many planes. &gt;&gt; It's just every day is an inspiration. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Perfect. Now, one important thing I have to ask all of you once you came back presumably you turned over the princess. You know, mission accomplished. We got her back. Did you report about what you learned about the Wildfire Brigade and them getting killed in the explosion on Operation Anvil and Ham Hammer? report to who? &gt;&gt; Your immediate handler would have been glasses and then up from glasses would have been Sanca. &gt;&gt; We were actually thinking about stacking glasses and maybe having a one-on-one with Sanca. &gt;&gt; Yeah, this cut right to the big cheese. &gt;&gt; Did we do we have a Did we get to talk about this beforehand? I feel &gt;&gt; like if nothing else, you would have had time on the way back. If anything from from where we were last time and what we were sort of discovering as we went, I think there was this idea or this high degree of suspicion that there might be something &gt;&gt; from your conversation with S Kofi, I remember &gt;&gt; uh that something may be hidden from us from the people in the upper echelon of the Teroden. &gt;&gt; So, do we even want to cut the line? Do we want to tell anybody? &gt;&gt; Boys, we don't know who to trust. &gt;&gt; No, that's the problem. No, &gt;&gt; I've come I've arrived to this to hanging out. I have like a 5:00 shadow. Uh, &gt;&gt; you good, man? Jesus Christ. She's &gt;&gt; Is that skin? &gt;&gt; It's kind of like SK. Yeah, it's like scale skin to me. &gt;&gt; I She &gt;&gt; Is that a hickey? &gt;&gt; I think so. She's with her mom, &gt;&gt; which is great for me. &gt;&gt; Great for her. &gt;&gt; So, yeah, I've been I've been I've been just busy. But guys, we I feel like we don't know who to trust and that's a bit scary to me. Also, I hope you're all enjoying my aura. &gt;&gt; It's as he comes around you, you do kind of feel just like &gt;&gt; safe around him. &gt;&gt; It's weird. It's just like right when he gets close to you, you do sort of feel like &gt;&gt; Do you like when I'm When do you feel safe? &gt;&gt; What is it? What is it? &gt;&gt; H aura. &gt;&gt; Aura. Yeah.

You're feeling the love of Horizon. &gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure. Her bosomous world. &gt;&gt; I mean, I feel Yeah, I feel safe. But like maybe like I'm wearing armor on like a date. Like I'm safe. &gt;&gt; Yeah, safe and I don't know if I &gt;&gt; Let me Let me rub your shell. It's like an itch I have to scratch right now.

Let me touch your shell. &gt;&gt; We're from the same place. We're from the same place. &gt;&gt; No, man. &gt;&gt; You have a bunch of turtle friends. &gt;&gt; You wouldn't get it, bro. It's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pain, dude. &gt;&gt; I grew up with a lot of turtles. &gt;&gt; I've just never seen the shell grow like that. &gt;&gt; You have to learn how to talk to people. You have eyes like an ocean. &gt;&gt; Whoa. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Where did you Where do you say you have eyes like an ocean? Calamity was walking by just kind of goes and then continues walking serving. &gt;&gt; That's so nice. Thank you, Stone Red. &gt;&gt; It's okay. You're welcome. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; That's a good line. &gt;&gt; Like an ocean. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Let's focus. &gt;&gt; I just I just I need to say I will keep this going for the next 50 episodes. &gt;&gt; Just I want you did this, not &gt;&gt; Well, yeah. Where's the chronology? Is the book done or am I still working on it right now? &gt;&gt; On a natural 20, I'm going to say it's done. Okay. Like it's the first book is out and it's &gt;&gt; I didn't have what it takes to finish it on anything lower than 20. I &gt;&gt; I worked on that forever. &gt;&gt; So I had a spark of genius. I had the right amount of indica and I Yeah. Okay. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it just comes out of you. &gt;&gt; Is it in bookstores now or he had an early manuscript? &gt;&gt; So we we've established that maybe there's some reader copies that are going out. You know what I mean? Like influential. &gt;&gt; I'm on the brink of a magnum opus that no one knows is mine. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. That's such a nice thing to say. Stone bread and I appreciate you. &gt;&gt; Maybe stupid. I don't know. &gt;&gt; I do like it. I do like the idea of like people whispering about this book through the Nexus like it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Bridgetgerton. &gt;&gt; It's like a net spend like &gt;&gt; so I look I do we we we were talking we we say [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] glasses we go to Sanc Kofa. What if we go to no one because we don't know who to trust? We don't we don't Listen, I have a good relationship with Sanc Kofa &gt;&gt; and I know he's done some weird things and I don't think I necessarily tell him everything that we know, &gt;&gt; but I need to ask questions. &gt;&gt; We control the narrative, bro. &gt;&gt; I don't think we know what the hell you're talking about. &gt;&gt; You might be one of the dumbest people in this group. &gt;&gt; You made some bread mad. &gt;&gt; What What have you done all break? Smoke weed. Hang out on the couch. That's well that's what I do. That's like kind of my thing. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You can't take that away. &gt;&gt; Pick up a book, loser. Sorry. &gt;&gt; You see Calamity comes back serving the drinks and she's like he thinks he's JP or something. &gt;&gt; JP it's all right, bro. You enjoy your time luxurious food. &gt;&gt; By the way, you'll [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] see. You're going to see all &gt;&gt; in the back of the leaf package deliveries you've been getting. doesn't count as read anymore. &gt;&gt; It says something changed about you, Gorg. I just sort of &gt;&gt; You're a little safer. &gt;&gt; Yeah, a little bit. &gt;&gt; I keep this place safe. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's Well, thank you. &gt;&gt; New Calamity in this place where unfortunately Bejorn did hang out. Uh but he's dead now. &gt;&gt; I I keep it safe. &gt;&gt; It was open arms for Bejorn here. &gt;&gt; We should talk about that later on. We should talk about like how we kind of fostered an environment where Bjorn &gt;&gt; Bujorn was allowed &gt;&gt; was allowed to be &gt;&gt; should nip that in the bud. &gt;&gt; Yes. You know it's I just was like go along to get along it takes all kinds. But you are correct. The next time somebody conducts themselves in such an ungentlemanly way. I I'll ask you all to sort of &gt;&gt; I like Riley. &gt;&gt; That's well no Riley was I think Riley kind of kept yawn like under control. You know &gt;&gt; they grew up together. &gt;&gt; You know how it is. Sometimes you you go way back with someone and then they start reading the wrong pamphlets. &gt;&gt; Shaq and Kobe &gt;&gt; like Exactly. You know, from the cautionary tale of the queen, the giant, &gt;&gt; the tortoise. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And Cobay the samurai. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Well, well, I agree. You want to meet with Sanc Kofa? I agree with Stone Beard. &gt;&gt; I trust you. Look, you're the leader. I I trust you. I delegate the idea of giving him the right information that maybe keeps a little close to the chest. Stone bread, &gt;&gt; I think it would behoove us to not approach him all four, at least in our normal forms. &gt;&gt; Perhaps if you were to disguise yourself, &gt;&gt; behoove one or two words. &gt;&gt; If you were to disguise yourself and hang out as a normal bar patron, I invite him here and it seems like it's just me and Leonus. So Leonus is very um &gt;&gt; he talks to characters feminine. &gt;&gt; Thimble is like you're a shadow, bro. &gt;&gt; I'm like I think I I get what you're getting at. I turn into Bejorn &gt;&gt; like this. &gt;&gt; Oh no, no. Somebody literally like drops their cup and they're like, "Oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Bejorn, you're alive." &gt;&gt; Turn back. Oh, I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; Okay, good. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; maybe not Bejorn. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay, I see. I see. &gt;&gt; Great idea. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You want me to be like side by side with you or like like blending in in the background? Cuz I've been doing I've been working on that lately. I've been doing a good job. &gt;&gt; Yes. I don't even know where you are now, man. What What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; When you go talk to Sanca, I sit like I can be right there with you, your right-hand man, or I blend in. &gt;&gt; Do you patron? He doesn't. &gt;&gt; Do you actually think you could blend in in a way that he wouldn't notice? &gt;&gt; I think is very vigilant. &gt;&gt; I have a decent track record. Yeah. Okay, then I guess me and you, Corg, will take it and you two blend in. &gt;&gt; Blend in. You shape shift. &gt;&gt; I I immediately turn into Dr. Ale, which is a nickname I gave to the guy over there who's always here. &gt;&gt; Is that guy here now? Is that &gt;&gt; right? That's &gt;&gt; that's inconspicuous. &gt;&gt; But I put on a hat. &gt;&gt; I look a little bit different. &gt;&gt; Perfect. &gt;&gt; All right, sounds good. Let's call him up. Uh, let's get him here. Stone Beard, &gt;&gt; give me another stealth here, Leonus. I believe in you. &gt;&gt; Do I need one, too? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; 16 total. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, it's sort of smoky in here. You kind of you kind of can go and like be the cool guy over in the corner like, you know, sort of &gt;&gt; 30 24. &gt;&gt; I just go sit in the booth on the on the other side. I I rolled a 15, but got 24 after bonus. &gt;&gt; Think you go walking by and you see some of the regulars look at you and they're like, &gt;&gt; "Doctor." And then they turn and look at him over there. like &gt;&gt; doctor &gt;&gt; uh and you move to the back uh and presumably you send word to to San Copa it's not hard to reach him &gt;&gt; this guy's name is like Greg &gt;&gt; yo what did you say you started calling him &gt;&gt; Dr. Al &gt;&gt; Dr. trail. Perfect. &gt;&gt; The creative mind of the creative mind of a soon to be author. &gt;&gt; It's Oh, he's going to write a book, too. Everybody's writing books these days. &gt;&gt; Takes a couple minutes uh for him to get here because uh Sanc Kofa is a very uh busy wizard and he doesn't walk in. There's just like a flash of light and he's just standing there. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ, dude. &gt;&gt; Stone Beard. &gt;&gt; Hey, man. Hey Kofa, I'm gone. &gt;&gt; Are you &gt;&gt; want an ale? &gt;&gt; Uh, I don't partake while I'm on duty. It's um &gt;&gt; It's 2:00 p.m. &gt;&gt; Yeah. When are you not a It's &gt;&gt; Well, it's it's 2 p.m. somewhere. Um, you know, I I read your mission report when you all came back. Um, it seemed a little um light on the details. And Princess Selenia, to her credit, has been uh rather tight-lipped as well. But you you do know that the the child has been altered. You are aware of that. Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. She's strong now. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; There are some differences with Princess Celadia, but &gt;&gt; I thought it was like a woman thing. &gt;&gt; You think all women become partial vampires? She's a dumpier now. &gt;&gt; You don't know. Like maybe she's got some &gt;&gt; I don't think we get to call them that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; No, that's literally what we get to call them. Like dumpier. That's what that word I thought it was just for one week of of the &gt;&gt; I I thought you were just showing like a new makeup. &gt;&gt; Wait, I I need to figure out a way to cast remove memory on myself. I don't need to. No. Um either way, there have been some, shall we say, diplomatic wrinkles from returning the princess with shadow powers. &gt;&gt; She's alive. She's alive. Is she not? &gt;&gt; That is the argument that I have made. The situation is ongoing. She is still here in the Nexus. We'll have to work on details if we have to keep them alive and stop them from getting magical powers. &gt;&gt; I would like if you have to retrieve someone in the future &gt;&gt; that they be retrieved in the state they were when they absconded, but um I'm negotiating it. She's the she's under observation. &gt;&gt; Appreciate it. Well done. &gt;&gt; Appreciate that. &gt;&gt; I mean I I'm sure that look, we don't have eyes on her. You know, none of us have been keeping tabs, but I think it. &gt;&gt; At least she seems fine. &gt;&gt; There have been several sightings of Leonus in her proximity. Um, I haven't seen that guy in a while. I I believe he believes that he is doing an excellent job obfuscating his presence. &gt;&gt; So, he thinks he's been hiding very cleanly from her and he's been following her around. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; And she's been telling people this. &gt;&gt; Uh, she didn't have to. Again, to to her credit, uh, she's been fairly tight- lipped about the entire thing. All she has said is that your team saved her life and that you're heroes. That is the only thing she wanted on the record. &gt;&gt; She used those words. &gt;&gt; She did. She did say about all four of you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Is is &gt;&gt; actually did more. &gt;&gt; She did say one thing. She did say it was Ron Kaledus in particular who was instrumental in uh driving Ketriga out of her in turning the undead. Um she did make a specific point that you all would have died if not for him and his heroism. Where is he by the way? You are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] He's not here. You are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me. &gt;&gt; You know he died a virgin in his past life. &gt;&gt; He did die a virgin. It's true. &gt;&gt; Cut to me and Leonus and we're sharing a trench coat &gt;&gt; side by side though in the corner of a bar. &gt;&gt; Completely. &gt;&gt; Interesting to think that that he was so instrumental because he uh for one is he's you know he's very weak physically. &gt;&gt; No. what he lacks outside of battle and brains and &gt;&gt; perhaps language he has in battle with &gt;&gt; really a heart of a warrior. &gt;&gt; God. So he lacks both strength and intelligence but is competent in a conflict. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I mean you ask that guy to like you know write instructions down on how to make a make a meat pie. He'd probably take a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in his diaper. &gt;&gt; He opens a pickle jar and uh well I hope wherever they are they aren't being mean to me. Glasses brought me your aftermission reported and as I said it did seem somewhat lacking. All it really said is you all pursued uh Riley Bujorn's kidnappers. They were KIA uh that you found where the undead had taken the princess that uh Ketriga was defeated and the princess was recovered. That is all it said. &gt;&gt; She was defeated. But I guess there's one additional piece that I wanted to talk to you about. &gt;&gt; Yes. Because defeated or destroyed because I can tell you vampires are a resilient lot. &gt;&gt; Hard hard to tell sometimes too, but &gt;&gt; they get mad at you and you don't know &gt;&gt; why. &gt;&gt; We uh we fought a lot of undead. &gt;&gt; It's Are you sure Ron is the only virgin? &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm sure brother. &gt;&gt; I got a damn kid. &gt;&gt; I got a receipt. &gt;&gt; To tell you &gt;&gt; or so you were told. But yes. Anyway. &gt;&gt; Ow. Sanca's got [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Sophia. We got jokes. We do. &gt;&gt; Do you remember Operation Anvil and Hammer? &gt;&gt; And you see when you say that, he just stops for a moment and he sort of takes those red glasses off and he just says, and you see everybody else in the room except you four, even though the two of you are hidden, stop moving. and he says, "I realize it's been some time, but that operation is still classified, but considering you were a part of the deployment at the time. I don't mind confirming." Yes, I am aware of that. &gt;&gt; It's weird that those two guys didn't fall asleep. &gt;&gt; Dr. number two. &gt;&gt; Very, very strange indeed. &gt;&gt; They're probably feeling really tired, though. &gt;&gt; Their heads are probably going to hit the ground at any moment. They're like ghosts. Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, to me just &gt;&gt; Did you Okay. &gt;&gt; You all you &gt;&gt; Ronin Leonus, &gt;&gt; I was not going to insult your intelligence by believing that uh you were actually hidden from me, but you you can join us here for the briefing. &gt;&gt; Hold on. And I say Rome Leon is now and I want to roll to command them to put Sanca in a full Nelson. &gt;&gt; That would be a horrible idea. I need wisdom saves from both of you. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; this is so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. &gt;&gt; Wisdom saves. &gt;&gt; 21 total. 11 total. &gt;&gt; He's like, "Now," and you're like, "Now what?" And Ron, you do feel compelled &gt;&gt; to run over and grab him. &gt;&gt; I do double swords. Even though I'm not going to use him, I start running. &gt;&gt; Give me an athletics check. &gt;&gt; Me? &gt;&gt; Yep. Cuz you're going to try and grab him &gt;&gt; before he tells me. I need you to know that. That is what just uh for another pet that's what they call out there. &gt;&gt; That's a bad roll. &gt;&gt; You see as he comes up. &gt;&gt; Am I still Dr. Al? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Dr. Got leader hos in on &gt;&gt; comes charging over and as you reach out to grab him, you see he just parries one of your arms and like just puts your head against the table and he's like, &gt;&gt; "Oh, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Dude, why did you tell me to do that?" I thought I thought it was just an idea. &gt;&gt; I'm so sorry, Sen Kofa. &gt;&gt; That maybe you're going to spend the rest of today not talking for &gt;&gt; dude. And you remember what we said about Ran. Apologies on our behalf. &gt;&gt; I don't have another one of these. &gt;&gt; He does let you up after a second. And he says, "I'm actually more offended by the fact that you thought that would work than an attack on a superior officer." &gt;&gt; I look I low key I didn't really really think about it. You two should be really mad at him that he was willing to risk your lives and not his own. &gt;&gt; He was they look they followed my orders. I thought &gt;&gt; Why did I do that? &gt;&gt; I thought you were being shady. &gt;&gt; Oh, look Ran, &gt;&gt; this should tell you so. This should be like a eye opener. &gt;&gt; I agree. Well, back to R. You all &gt;&gt; you got commanded by Gorg. &gt;&gt; That is true. I the alcohol I didn't really even hurt that much honestly. I'm kind of okay. I gird your mind a bit more that that was able to compel you. Leonus. Well done. That's you know how I'm smart. You know that's I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm hitting I'm on the roof right now. I didn't listen to it. We heard about the stalking. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Man, we've That's like the third time &gt;&gt; stalking the princess. &gt;&gt; It's not stalking when they consent. &gt;&gt; Let's get serious for a moment. &gt;&gt; I want to talk about Operation Anvil and Hammer. &gt;&gt; You told him? &gt;&gt; Well, I just told him that we went to the same site and I I want to know the truth. If we are going to speak, then let us speak with some um protections in place. And you see, he holds his hand up and a zone of truth goes out from him. And I need all of you to make charisma saves. &gt;&gt; I got &gt;&gt; RZ. &gt;&gt; I got some RZ. &gt;&gt; RZ. &gt;&gt; Boom. I got plus nine. &gt;&gt; I have minus one. &gt;&gt; My god. I have nine total. &gt;&gt; 15 total. &gt;&gt; Three. &gt;&gt; 12 total. This is why I was able to command Ro. &gt;&gt; So you with the zone of truth, all it means is you cannot knowingly lie. It does not compel you to tell the truth. Uh it also you can just be wrong about something. Uh like you can confidently say something that isn't true as long as you believe it. &gt;&gt; I was doing a great job following her. &gt;&gt; Right when you say that, he just looks at you for a second and he goes, "You Oh, all right. &gt;&gt; This thing on. I shouldn't I was following her. &gt;&gt; It's again if Leonus really believes he was doing a great job, you absolutely can say it. It's just you cannot knowingly lie. That's the only thing. And he just says, "Ask your questions. I will either answer truthfully or I reserve the right not to answer at all. You must understand that some things have to remain classified even after all this time." What happened? &gt;&gt; Do you remember how bad it was? Run, do you have any memories of that previous existence? &gt;&gt; Not of getting [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Besides my the girl I was seeing at the time. No, I'm pretty blank. &gt;&gt; Besides just being neck deep in trade, I don't remember anything. &gt;&gt; She fought a different war. &gt;&gt; Something something. &gt;&gt; He goes to a different battle. She said something the greatest I've ever heard. I can't I don't remember the whole thing. It was beautiful though. &gt;&gt; From the Kingdom of Canada. She doesn't go to this this detachment of the ter. &gt;&gt; No. Yo, we met on the internet. We met online. &gt;&gt; The internet. &gt;&gt; Gorgeous. &gt;&gt; Do you however have any memory of your time in the service? &gt;&gt; Uh, a little bit. Um, it was it was hard. uh as was war is um I just remember a lot of flames and burnt trees and a lot of people I knew dying. But for real? Yes. The truth is we were losing. We were mere weeks away from being overrun, and we were the last line of defense against the portal that the unspoken ones hordes were pouring out of. The decision was made that there was no length that we would not go to to stop his advance, and the weapon was unleashed. And unfortunately or fortunately, the weapon was successful. What about Coette? &gt;&gt; You see, he like stops for a second and he says, "What did she tell you? Did she tell you that the minions of the plane of Asphodel were outnumbered us by many magnitudes? Did she tell you about the airship that they had and the ground weapons and the horrible siege engines? What did she say to you about the conflict? &gt;&gt; She didn't tell us anything. She showed us. &gt;&gt; Would you mind if I were to peer into your mind and see what it is that she showed you? I won't force it. &gt;&gt; You sure you want to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You sure you want to get up in there, bro? &gt;&gt; Whose mind do you want to play with the most? that I when you say it like that, not yours. &gt;&gt; You're the one who asked for it. &gt;&gt; That's &gt;&gt; You're You asked for it. &gt;&gt; I'll do anything once, bro. &gt;&gt; He's like, "Um, if I must peer inside." &gt;&gt; Who you want to dig around, bro? Who Who do you want? &gt;&gt; It's gross when you say it like that. &gt;&gt; Just get in there. &gt;&gt; Leonus, I feel will be &gt;&gt; the youngest. &gt;&gt; The least. &gt;&gt; I didn't even offer. &gt;&gt; Well, that's why I'm asking if you consent. If you don't, I won't force it. &gt;&gt; You know he's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stalking the princess, right? You really want to see what's going on in that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; He's not stalking when she consents. She finds it charming that he watches over her. I know. Otherwise, I would have had him taken into custody. &gt;&gt; This is a circle of truth. &gt;&gt; Charming. &gt;&gt; That's huge. &gt;&gt; Charming. &gt;&gt; He likes that. &gt;&gt; Do you think I should do it? &gt;&gt; In full disclosure, if you allow this, I will see everything that transpired. I think of all of us here, you're the most pure of heart. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you have nothing to hide. &gt;&gt; Yes. Nothing. Nothing to hide. &gt;&gt; We're in the zone of truth, by the way. Still, &gt;&gt; uh, ultimately, it's your decision, and I trust you. &gt;&gt; I am confident that this is something that will be appropriate. &gt;&gt; Give it a go. It sounds weird when you when you say, "Okay, &gt;&gt; look only to the right when you're in there." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh he reaches out uh and he puts his hand on your head and uh I assume it is your intent not to resist. &gt;&gt; No resistance. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Give me a wisdom save anyway. &gt;&gt; Uh nine total. &gt;&gt; Your thoughts immediately go to something that you absolutely do not want him to see. Leonus, it very much is one of those don't think of a pink elephant type thing. You know, you're like, as long as he doesn't see uh what is it that you think of immediately, Leonus, that you very much had hoped he wouldn't see? &gt;&gt; Oh, it's it's it's me back at home uh in in the sea, but the princess is there with me and and my dad my dad is hugging my dad's hugging both of us at the same time. And he's my dad. My dad is my dad gives me kisses her on the mouth and then he kisses me on the just &gt;&gt; and then later I try to put a finger in my ass. &gt;&gt; Don't expand. Don't expand. That didn't happen. That's I just I just want to be respected and loved &gt;&gt; again since can't lie either. Although you all do not see that. You see him touch Leonus' head and go, "Oh, &gt;&gt; oh, okay." &gt;&gt; Sopha, what do you see? &gt;&gt; No, it's um &gt;&gt; Please, Sophie, you must tell us. &gt;&gt; No, I mustn't. This is &gt;&gt; Senova, tell us the exact thing you just looked at in the zone of &gt;&gt; um Does it have to do with Katrigo? &gt;&gt; It does not. Um and he's like just puts the other hand on your head. &gt;&gt; You got the wrong [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] TV station. Keep hitting it. Yeah. Yeah. And he just like very quietly whispers near you, Leon. It's just, "Wow." &gt;&gt; And you you do you are aware of his mind sort of plumbing the depths of your mind. Uh and he does see everything that happened with Coette, but he also sees everything that has happened in recent weeks. Uh uh including your encounters with the various deities and the pact you made with Petraore. Oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. And he just sort of goes, "Oh well." um and he does kind of take his hands away and he goes, "Well, that explains uh" and he just points right at Thimble, who is invisible, but he points right at him and he's like, &gt;&gt; "Thimble, you can just &gt;&gt; No, shut up, bro. I'm invisible. the bleet. He knows you're there. &gt;&gt; There's no way he knows, dude. I'm invisible. &gt;&gt; Sopa, trust me, Sopha knows. He knows a lot. &gt;&gt; And he just looks right at him and he's like, "I do know a lot, thimble." And you see, he very much appears in like this act natural type. He's like, "What? Huh? Oh, me. I was a bar patron and I just landed on this &gt;&gt; diade statuesque elf to um actually I take that back. He can't knowingly lie in the zone of truth. So he's like I was hiding so I wouldn't get caught. &gt;&gt; I mean I just I just flew &gt;&gt; I mean I just just got here. Okay. You know what you know. And you see, he kind of steps back and he just sort of sits down heavily and he says, "What she showed you is true." This was a century ago, and although I was already serving with the Pterodin, I did not hold the position I currently occupy. When the decision was made to unleash the weapon, I objected. I said there was not enough time for the Wildfire Brigade to fall back. The decision was made that they were going to die if their position was overrun anyway. &gt;&gt; And the mission was a success. &gt;&gt; Who made the decision? &gt;&gt; The current leadership at the time and most of which is still in place today, but not all. &gt;&gt; And what was their punishment? Their punishment for victory, Stone Beard, promotion. That was their punishment. Promotion. They were heroes. &gt;&gt; The people should know the truth. I of course will do nothing to try and stop any of you or alter any of your memories of these events. But I ask you to be very careful before you follow that line of reasoning because where do you think it goes that is good? new leadership. &gt;&gt; The Pterodin have protected all five kingdoms for over a century. The people have some semblance of normality. The unspoken one is forgotten by all but so few of us that remember how truly terrible he was. And I must say I envy you for having forgotten him. Should that be undone, I personally believe that their sacrifices and those like him would actually be for not. &gt;&gt; I feel like a sac a sacrifice is a it's a mutual thing. You know, you're making a sacrifice. They were murdered. &gt;&gt; There is now one other thing. I know. Strega surrendered and you all didn't take her into custody. &gt;&gt; He did consent. &gt;&gt; Dude, is that all you saw? &gt;&gt; No, I saw a great deal more. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; You have an interesting relationship with your father. &gt;&gt; Maybe talk to someone. &gt;&gt; He doesn't talk about his dad a lot. &gt;&gt; He probably should. manazul. &gt;&gt; So we don't we don't need to talk about all have extensive therapeutic resources available to the pterodin. You you all lead a very stressful exist. &gt;&gt; We didn't take string in. We didn't take string in. &gt;&gt; I have a better elf subscription if you want. &gt;&gt; You can just hop on my thing. &gt;&gt; I just feel like we should How about we go we get some some paid leave. We have um you must know a way to contact Trio and at any moment we can have her surrender. &gt;&gt; You could. &gt;&gt; Would you have us do that? &gt;&gt; I would have the four of you do what you believe is right. &gt;&gt; Dova, are you mad that I tried to get him to put you in a full Nelson? I'm just It's been I've been thinking about it a lot. &gt;&gt; Genuinely insulted. Yes, &gt;&gt; you thought it was insulted. &gt;&gt; Yes. Genuinely. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. again, not even thinking that you would have a a chance against me, but thinking that that was the move. &gt;&gt; It's just like we we're getting so much new information and I just I wanted it was weighing on me and I'm glad we talked about it. I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; So, I just need you to know there are reasons why I made him team leader and not you. Can &gt;&gt; is it possible for me to roll to see if I remember the name of who was in charge when this happened rather than it being vague to us? &gt;&gt; It would be history at disadvantage. It was a hundred years ago in literally another life. &gt;&gt; That sucks. &gt;&gt; That's a big role. &gt;&gt; Yeah, but it's the lower one. So, I got a four. I got a four. &gt;&gt; Four. Huh. &gt;&gt; Ran. It's like, not to put words in your mouth, but it's like culturally in my like you don't even try and remember the past life. You're like, "Yeah, that was another person." You know what I mean? Like &gt;&gt; just a dry [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] person. &gt;&gt; You're different now. Do you think it's worth talking to any of the leaders? &gt;&gt; Listen to me here in this place where I am incapable of deception. I think the worst thing you could do right now is having certain people know that what you know. You should keep this to yourself for the time being. Is my counsel. &gt;&gt; What would Horizon do, man? If if I were to use it as allegory in like some sort of thing I was working on that's like entirely fictional. &gt;&gt; Have you guys read The Life Between Us? &gt;&gt; Um I just &gt;&gt; I love it. &gt;&gt; I haven't felt those things since I was &gt;&gt; You guys got copies of them? &gt;&gt; It's a It's a It's a book. &gt;&gt; Oh, he's a book. &gt;&gt; It's arousal. It's actually also so genuine. &gt;&gt; What do you guys think? I just didn't think I but she can see so much in the dead man. &gt;&gt; I think I think I think the author is a woman with a man's handle. &gt;&gt; Sounds like a man. &gt;&gt; It is someone who truly understands what it means. Like a chill vibe &gt;&gt; like a guy with an awesome vibe. &gt;&gt; I can't even read much. It's hard for me. I don't zone of truth. &gt;&gt; I'll see if I can I'll see if I can get you all copies. &gt;&gt; It's not hard for me. &gt;&gt; They wouldn't read it. They wouldn't read it. &gt;&gt; I've been busy. I've been on duty. &gt;&gt; He wouldn't get it. They don't read I I just don't I can't It's really hard. I can't like that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] over there. &gt;&gt; You guys are enjoying the book. &gt;&gt; Glad. Why would you care about the book? &gt;&gt; You never struck me as the intellectual type, but I could get you a copy if you would like to. &gt;&gt; That's the That's the copy. &gt;&gt; That's the Jonathan Bork title. &gt;&gt; I know a little bit about it. &gt;&gt; Jonathan Bork. &gt;&gt; Jonathan Bor. &gt;&gt; I'll follow your words and I won't &gt;&gt; We won't bring this up to others for now. &gt;&gt; Might I make a request from you? Oh, that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rich. &gt;&gt; That's rich. &gt;&gt; You don't even know why. You're just going with this. Like, you're just sort of a a follower, Yorg. You're just sort of a yes man. &gt;&gt; But you can feel safe around him. &gt;&gt; You feel a little safer, though. &gt;&gt; Ain't that crazy? &gt;&gt; I shouldn't though. You are the last person I should entrust. And yet, &gt;&gt; Bejorn when he was alive. &gt;&gt; Well, it's not Bejorn. Riley. Riley was gorn. &gt;&gt; Oh, prick. Yeah, it's uh but you know his dad is sort of a high ranking. You know how it is. Um listen, I know quite a bit. I've been blessed to amass some power in my time, but I don't know everything. These crossroads people organization cultists, I don't know what to call them. If Coette Strega is correct, that is a greater risk to all of this than anything else. I think maybe you all should find out if she's telling the truth or at the very minimum to see and do not laugh how deeply they have penetrated our organization. &gt;&gt; Infiltrated. That's the word. I mean, how deeply they've infiltrated. Yeah, but you didn't say you should penetrate. &gt;&gt; It takes significant concentration to freeze time for an entire room full of people and keep four active. Okay. Just significant sorceries taking place that no one &gt;&gt; No, it's impressive. It's &gt;&gt; in the zone of truth and you said I'm maintaining both of those which isn't supposed to be possible. Just again for anyone keeping score and sex and sex which I've had is hilarious. I understand you not knowing like you know who to trust and I think it is probably best to only trust each other for the time being at least until more evidence comes to light. &gt;&gt; Are you going to tell people about this? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Me neither. Then &gt;&gt; I trust you guys in my life. &gt;&gt; I trust most of you guys too. &gt;&gt; I'll explore the dad thing later, but I'm with you. &gt;&gt; We don't I don't think we need to explore the dad thing. &gt;&gt; You've explored it far enough. I've been explored too much. Actually, &gt;&gt; I like saying things in the circle of truth because they're true. And when I said I could trust you guys in my life, I didn't. I mean it cuz you know it's true. &gt;&gt; No, for real. Most of you though, I do trust most of you. &gt;&gt; I think I should touch your shell. &gt;&gt; You can't just ask someone to touch their shell, man. That's not &gt;&gt; I'm hurt by &gt;&gt; I want to zone of truth, so I want to get out. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's great. All right, we'll talk about your dad. Old man is I'll give him a ring on the sending stone. Before I drop the zone of truth, I will simply say I too will look into this from my side. &gt;&gt; Okay, for what it's worth, I um I don't know any more about it. &gt;&gt; Before the zone of truth falls, I want to try and put San Kofa in a full Nelson &gt;&gt; just cuz the whole time I was thinking like if I did it though, it would have worked. &gt;&gt; It's stone beard. &gt;&gt; Uh give me give me athletics. You can rage first if you like. &gt;&gt; I'm going to rage first. &gt;&gt; That's with advantage. Yes. &gt;&gt; Come on, snow beard. Put this old ass man in a bowl in uh 15. &gt;&gt; You come and you try and grab him and he does exactly the thing from the arm wrestling competition that Calamity did to you where he's like, "Oh, oh no, you've almost got me. I taught you that move, son." Just like same thing Stone Beard instantly. &gt;&gt; Just wanted to make sure that I still respected you. &gt;&gt; He's strong. He's strong. He's like, it's it's mostly technique. Um but um he says, "So, however, in order to maintain appearances, it is time for you all to be deployed on your next mission. So, tomorrow morning, you will assemble with glasses. You will choose where you will be deployed. Keep doing what you do. Keep making a difference because whatever may or may not be happening, that princess is alive thanks to the four of you." And Leonus, the fact that you are still concerned about her well-being is a positive, not a negative. &gt;&gt; Just be slightly less cringe next time. &gt;&gt; You're an 11. Bring it to like a &gt;&gt; He's in the zone of truth. That's crazy. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; I would be so hurt. &gt;&gt; The first time anyone's ever said that word here, &gt;&gt; the first time it happened &gt;&gt; in the zone of truth. It just hurts so much more. and he goes like and when he kind of clenches his fist, not only does the zone of truth go away, but everybody starts moving again in the room. And he stands up and he's like, "So, tomorrow morning, mission briefing with Calamity." Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Good. &gt;&gt; With glasses. Sorry, Calamity is right over there. &gt;&gt; I have a lot happening right now. Mission briefing with glasses. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Two guys trying to &gt;&gt; drink from Calamity. &gt;&gt; Yes. He's like, &gt;&gt; "Love drinking." &gt;&gt; Yeah. And he goes like, "Uh, take it easy, buddy. Okay, you're you're still on duty." Uh, and Calamity just looks up and she goes, "I am so sorry, Sanca. He insisted that I order this githon swill from somewhere god knows where." &gt;&gt; You drink that dog that dog [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Mine only. Sorry. &gt;&gt; You drink that dog [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] No one wants to drink his dog [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; She's like, "It will take the color off your shell." Okay, you don't don't touch it. &gt;&gt; I was just stick to my tortal ale, bro. &gt;&gt; Right. And you see uh seeing Kofa does just sort of nod and again he's just gone. &gt;&gt; Hate when he does that. &gt;&gt; He could just walk out. I feel like &gt;&gt; I feel like we're left with nothing. &gt;&gt; We just have to do our mission. We have to keep this information close to the chest. Senopa seems fine. I know I'm not a trustworthy guy unless it's you guys and Dr. Al. He's He's over there &gt;&gt; just looking [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Leonus. You hear &gt;&gt; what? Dimbo &gt;&gt; in near the front of the bar. You see a little black kingu cruncher going. &gt;&gt; Oh, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Thimble, it's Cruncher. And you have clearly have terrible judgment about this stuff. We've been He told us we were bad at it in the zone of truth. Okay, first of all, I'm literally invisible. Okay, like I don't &gt;&gt; He knew you were there. You told me that she couldn't see me. &gt;&gt; I just I was just trying to be a height man. &gt;&gt; She's not even going to talk to us anymore. &gt;&gt; You see, Cruncher sort of like walks over towards you and he just like kind of waves at the four of you. He opens his mouth and you hear Princess Selenia's voice come out of out of his mouth. Uh, perfect memory. She goes, "Hi you guys. Um, I figure you should be going on a mission again soon and maybe you could bring me with you. I don't know. We could we could figure something out. Um, but either way, Leonus, thank you for keeping an eye on me. It's very sweet. &gt;&gt; It just bro &gt;&gt; if if you if you want to hang out, all you have to do is just ask. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; And then like his mouth closes. &gt;&gt; That's so great. &gt;&gt; That's a good That's a good sign. She likes you. &gt;&gt; So great. That's a good sign. She likes you. He like slams the other shoulder. &gt;&gt; Oh no. &gt;&gt; You should. &gt;&gt; And then you hear him say, "Oh no." &gt;&gt; And then he turns and runs out. &gt;&gt; Bye, Cruncher. &gt;&gt; Wait. Wait. Cruncher. Wait. Are we Are we telling her no? &gt;&gt; And he just like points in the direction. He goes, "Oh no." &gt;&gt; Cruncher is roasting the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of you. &gt;&gt; I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hate this. &gt;&gt; Roasting the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of you, bro. &gt;&gt; Crunch. We'll call her. We'll call her later. &gt;&gt; Hate Cruncher. We'll use our uh messaging. &gt;&gt; You're going to cry. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to cry. &gt;&gt; Cry. Cry. I'm going to cry. &gt;&gt; And he like like very much like Ela. &gt;&gt; See, I don't know if she should come with I don't know if she should come. &gt;&gt; Well, it appears you have a more fragile relationship. We'll let you make the decision. Whatever you want, we'll do. &gt;&gt; I get to decide if she comes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Are you scared that she might end up liking me more? &gt;&gt; It's very possible she would. He's very charming. &gt;&gt; I think she's into young street soldiers. I don't know. That's really your kind of body. &gt;&gt; You do see Cruncher just sort of like leans up against you. Again, the aura of protection is just sort of like &gt;&gt; I've hit him on the head. &gt;&gt; Cruncher is very small. He's like 4 foot and weighs like maybe 70 lbs. Like Kingu are small creatures. So, &gt;&gt; do you think she feels safe around me? Like we feel like he makes us feel. &gt;&gt; I think she notices when you're around for sure. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He opens his mouth again and you hear her voice again say that's very sweet, Leonus. And he just closes his mouth again. She called. &gt;&gt; She did say she if if she would hang out if I asked her. And hanging out is kind of like an adventure. And it's not that dangerous cuz she's a a damper. Now &gt;&gt; you're explaining it too much. It's like kind of killing. &gt;&gt; I just feel like I just feel like that's it's if we were to just look at the evidence objectively of whether or not she should come and hang out with us. &gt;&gt; He open he opens his mouth again and you hear the voice of two women saying, "Your eyes are like the moon." In the the moonlight on the ocean. Oh my god, it was so beautiful. I wish I had a man like Jonathan Pork. &gt;&gt; What's that from? &gt;&gt; And the mouth closed. &gt;&gt; What's that from? &gt;&gt; Is that that author? &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's Jonathan Por. &gt;&gt; Oh, you read that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] too, Cruncher? &gt;&gt; No, me neither. I don't like words. &gt;&gt; I haven't had time to read it. &gt;&gt; I I've had time to read it. &gt;&gt; Cruncher gets me. &gt;&gt; What do you want to do? &gt;&gt; She should come with us. &gt;&gt; Okay, for sure. &gt;&gt; Sounds good. For sure. I thought about it, Cruncher. &gt;&gt; TJ, come with us for sure. I thought about it and he was like, "Bruncher, make sure you don't repeat a lot of the stuff we were talking about, right?" Like some of the stuff to her. Cruncher, you know, do you, man. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Crunch before you go. &gt;&gt; You man, before you go, before you go, &gt;&gt; Leonus, what a small penis. It's like just like nails it out of there. Just like little &gt;&gt; It's not small. &gt;&gt; Brought it out of the bar. &gt;&gt; Cruncher say it's not small back to me cuz he's already gone. &gt;&gt; Cruncher just like motions like &gt;&gt; Cruncher. I know you can hear me. &gt;&gt; Cruncher say it's not small. Cruncher say it's not small. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it just bails out. &gt;&gt; I love that little guy. &gt;&gt; Perfect. Okay. So, uh, unless there's anything else, day is going to go on. Uh, and when it finally comes time to bed down for the night, each of you just roll a d20 for me. Just roll a 20. &gt;&gt; Give me that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; I've rolled a four. &gt;&gt; Seven. &gt;&gt; Me, too. Do you want to reroll? &gt;&gt; No. Eight. &gt;&gt; We both roll four. &gt;&gt; That's okay. &gt;&gt; Okay, chill. &gt;&gt; Four, four, seven, and eight. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. I roll the highest. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Jesus. Unfortunately, that means when sleep finds you, you all have pretty bad dreams. Uh, again, &gt;&gt; is Leonus's dream about his and this is &gt;&gt; Well, hang on. I'm just &gt;&gt; We're going to turn to Leon. No, that's a bad dream. A four is a pretty bad I unfortunately an eight is just under average. It's like unpleasant but not a nightmare. Ran. So, uh, you tell me what Ran dreams about. My memory of the past is hazy. Uh I I' I've never forgotten my best friend that was that was killed and whose sword I carry, but a lot of the war is gone, but I start to get flashes looking around at fellow soldiers of mine uh being killed and and remembering what it felt like to lose my best friend. And uh I sort of roll around in in agony of that feeling all night. You see, Al looks at you in this dream and he just says, "Bro, you don't even remember. You don't even remember. You don't even And as he opens, it's like blood starts to kind of fill up in his mouth as it starts coming out." He's like, "That's not blood. It's barbecue sauce." &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; It's fine. &gt;&gt; Perfect. And what what did you get there? &gt;&gt; Uh, I got a seven. &gt;&gt; Uh, same thing. Um, not quite full nightmare territory, but an unpleasant dream. That's an unpleasant dream. There's I'm just rolling around. I had a great a great uncle. We had a lot of uncles in our family and his name was Beeron and I He's for some reason I just keep thinking about him and his name and it's kind of ringing out and it's I'm not putting it together, but I I have this dream that Horizon is visiting me, but Horizon isn't how I've typically pictured Horizon. Horizon is just like a like a normal like &gt;&gt; like a big dude and it's kind of like made out of like ocean stuff. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And like like foam colored &gt;&gt; like foam colored like very like waterbased and it's like it's just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] freaks me out cuz it's like this isn't &gt;&gt; like that's not the horizon like I know. And it's just I'm not right like and I'm just tossing into &gt;&gt; a false horizon basically. &gt;&gt; I have a false horizon dream and it's like that's not fun. &gt;&gt; Perfect. Uh, now same thing uh with a four. We're we're moving into to pretty unpleasant dream territory, Stone Beard. So you you tell me what it is. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So I'm I'm at the bar and I'm drinking ale and it starts off nice and then Gorg shows up and he says, "Want to see a trick?" And then he starts to make love to Showy the Magnificent. And every time I close my eyes, they enter my eyeballs. And then eventually I say enough and then it flashes me over to the visions that Coette Strea was giving me. And and so and so then I'm like go back and I have to choose between watching Gorg have sex with Shozy or the war images and I choose the sex &gt;&gt; and I'm both are people fighting for their lives. &gt;&gt; Let let me add to that since this was a pretty bad dream. Yeah, &gt;&gt; considering the first time you met Josie, she you died fighting her. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, in the midst of this, she just looks at you and she goes, "Steone beard, remember that other move we've got?" and grabs you and like starts beating her wings and flying up into the air with George holding on. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm just going &gt;&gt; dick out. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. His dick is out. &gt;&gt; It's like a cobra. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it is like a cobra. Uh, perfect. And last, but certainly not least, Leonis. Again, we we are firmly in bad dream territory. &gt;&gt; I've arrived uh uh back to back in uh Leo and I'm underwater. I'm walking handinhand with the princess. I'm going home. I'm going to go visit my parents and introduce them to my new my new girlfriend. And the beginning of the greeting and the vision that that Sakova ripped from my mind, we're back. We're back there. But as as my dad as my dad leans down, uh, he morphs the the he morphs into this great pillar of fire and the water sizzles and burns away and the Leo becomes the the sea that we're in in Lake becomes a wasteland. and my dad has morphed into the creeping knight and and leans continues to lean down to kiss me on the mouth but sucks me sucks me into sucks me into his body and I'm burning and I'm screaming and the echoes of the creeping knight saying you have a small penis you have a small penis as I fall through this like what feels like this infinite hole of the creepy knight &gt;&gt; those aren't my genetics you have a small penis small &gt;&gt; and I'm kind of I land on the bottom of like some sort of well or chasm and my body is literally like frying and flailing. My skin is being like seared off of me and I'm morphing into this like red blob and the world is like contorting around me and I see uh Jackson all of a sudden taking a big puff of a cigar and the the morphing like glow is the tip of his cigar as he watches the bombs fall down on his friends in the distance. &gt;&gt; He realizes that all of these people that he's known and fought this through this war with are dying in front of him. And I feel the pain that he feels of watching his friends and comrades uh die in the distance without getting to say goodbye because he thought he was going to be able to go back to those people. Uh and I'm I wake up. I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sweaty and my my bed looks disgusting. &gt;&gt; Perfect. Incredible. Uh well, dawn comes again uh after a unfortunately fairly uneasy night for all of you. Um, does anybody do anything before you show up for the before you show up for the briefing? &gt;&gt; I take a leak and brush my teeth. &gt;&gt; Perfect. I don't even shower. I just walk out. &gt;&gt; You are a dead guy. &gt;&gt; You're already dead, man. Like, what difference does it make? &gt;&gt; I shave. I'm like, you know what? Let's pull ourselves out of this. You know, I've been going through some stuff. &gt;&gt; Is it weird being alone in the house now that GJ's gone? &gt;&gt; It kind of is, but it's like it's what I wanted, right? So, like, why why is it affecting me in this way? You know, and so I shave. I'm like, "Yeah, let's put our hair." You make everybody else feel safe, but who's making you feel safe? &gt;&gt; Bars. &gt;&gt; Same thing, Leon. Has anything before? &gt;&gt; Uh, I mean, I really I hate when we come back from a big from a big mission and my bed's all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up and yellow from like sweat stains of a nightmare. &gt;&gt; So, I I like do like start doing the laundry. And me and Thimble aren't talking right now cuz this guy's been lying through his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] teeth or is just dumb because he that he was selling me on how good I was at hiding. I feel embarrassed and ashamed. &gt;&gt; Hey, hey, hey, look, bro. Look, bro. Everybody else is so hard on you. All right. And I'm just trying to like just be a hype man. &gt;&gt; I don't know if she could see you. &gt;&gt; But you can't you can't just lie to hype me up. &gt;&gt; Then I'm more famous later. I'm not talking to you. I changed my I said I wasn't talking to you. I'm not going to talk to you. &gt;&gt; I'm just Okay, look. But they lie to make you feel bad all the time. Why can't I lie to make you feel good? &gt;&gt; Uh, I need to get my laundry done. &gt;&gt; I mean, can I can I help? I mean, I just &gt;&gt; touch it. &gt;&gt; I said no talking. I know I've said I know I've spoken after saying no talking. I'm not talking to you from now until I've decided I'm talking to you again. and he just looks at you and he goes and turns invisible and you don't know where he is. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Because unless he reveals himself when he's invisible, you don't know where he is. &gt;&gt; Where? &gt;&gt; He just disappears. Perfect. Um you all arrive uh again back at Calamities because this is where you've started taking your briefings even though uh apparently Calamities is open 24 hours a day and every time you come here that Cobalt is here still out serving drinks. Uh, and as you all are arriving, you see glasses again, this small beholder. And as you all come in, like different eye stalks look at each of you, and she goes, "Well, you guys all look like you've been rung through it, rode hard, and put up wet, such as it is." &gt;&gt; And Glasses doesn't know that we know. &gt;&gt; Glasses doesn't know anything. &gt;&gt; Glasses. &gt;&gt; Yeah, Stone Beard. &gt;&gt; Well, it's a mission. &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh, we're just right to Okay, fine. So, listen. Uh, it's come down from on high that you all actually get to make a choice. You can decide where you go next. Isn't that wonderful that one of the rewards for your heroism is you get to decide where you potentially can die horribly next? &gt;&gt; Yes. Glasses. &gt;&gt; It's a very fair and egalitarian system. &gt;&gt; Beautifully said. Have you been reading John Pork's recent &gt;&gt; tester book? &gt;&gt; No. Why would I read? He hasn't read it either. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Why? Why? Why would I be reading something like such heartbreaking beauty? And &gt;&gt; you really should. You really should. &gt;&gt; I I don't even have legs. I don't know why the life between us would &gt;&gt; It's an examination of the soul and then the soul beyond the soul. &gt;&gt; Each one of her little eye stalks, like a little tear starts to form at the bottom of it, and she goes, &gt;&gt; "I don't think I'd be interested. Perhaps we should just talk about the mission. Apparently, my allergies are acting up." Can you see like a little handkerchief floats up? It just dabs each eye one by one and it's like yeah allergies dusty in here. Also, I'm not saying that you should read it, but should you find the time to read it, perhaps it would be interesting to you in a way that it is not interesting enough, Mr. Pork, what are five? We got five. Five options. &gt;&gt; It's hard for me. &gt;&gt; Five options. &gt;&gt; They don't usually give us this many options. &gt;&gt; A lot of things that go on the kingdom. Wait, &gt;&gt; I'll pick four. &gt;&gt; I just I got hyped on that. I don't know. That was That was cool. &gt;&gt; Four. It's a cool one. You're saying you don't even want to hear what your choices are? &gt;&gt; Let's hear the choices. &gt;&gt; I would like So, I would like to hear the choices. &gt;&gt; Let's leave it to God. &gt;&gt; Well, let's hear it first. That's also a four-sided die. &gt;&gt; That is carry around a thing with dyes. &gt;&gt; It's like Kelps. I suppose you just carry around them. &gt;&gt; Just keep them around. &gt;&gt; It's okay. So, let me let me He's already acting bored. He just got here. Okay. So, real quick. Real quick. Don't make me turn your stone. I will. &gt;&gt; Sorry. Sorry. &gt;&gt; All right. So, first you got a mission where you can go to Waldane. Okay. There is a powerful forest spirit. Once a protector of the woods has become corrupted by a strange disease spreading through the ancient forest, the spirit is now maddened and destructive and is threatening to unleash chaos on the surrounding villages and sacred groves. Here's the thing. Last time you guys went to Waldane, you kind of caused more problems that than you solved, but they still are asking for help. So, who knows? Uh, then we got one in. It's up where those like high fallutin angels live, which this kind of bothers me because Asher, the one light, like she don't even like look in or talk to you guys. I I read your reports, but they're still asking for help. So, there is a celestial phenomenon. Those are big words. uh an eclipse that was not foretold by the heavens has darkened the skies over us and the people are in a state of fear and the celestial order seems disrupted and they believe that there's a rogue group of celestial beings that are disillusioned with the empire are behind the disturbance and trying to summon a powerful entity from beyond the stars. What is up with everybody having like hidden sleeper agents in their place now? That's weird. &gt;&gt; Space freaks me out. Space freaks me out. I like the water. &gt;&gt; I get Yeah. As far as I understand, there's no water in space. &gt;&gt; Well, it's fine. As &gt;&gt; far as I understand, that's what makes it space. &gt;&gt; But I've never been. &gt;&gt; I hate that. &gt;&gt; I'm just telling you what I heard. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I hate it. It scares me. I have been. &gt;&gt; She's right. &gt;&gt; Does Does he look extra damp to you today? I mean, I realize he's a seal. This is sort of like &gt;&gt; It's like you're always wet. Now you're more wet. No, I'm the normal amount of wet. I think &gt;&gt; he's very pit stainy for this hour. There's that. It's even wetness. &gt;&gt; It's okay. It's just weird. &gt;&gt; You're weird. &gt;&gt; I think he had a bad dream. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Where's Thimble? You look &gt;&gt; empty. I love that little guy. &gt;&gt; We don't need the symbol on this one. &gt;&gt; I feel like he's helpful. &gt;&gt; I like symbol. &gt;&gt; He's kind of been [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] He's been [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up the vibes lately. &gt;&gt; Wow. Wow. &gt;&gt; So, I think maybe we just &gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up the vibes. That's hard. &gt;&gt; Sounds like they're projecting. &gt;&gt; What was the third mission? What was the third mission? &gt;&gt; Sorry. &gt;&gt; I'm seeing a trend in these missions. Excuse me, Leonus. Wait, let me get back to it here. Okay, so um &gt;&gt; Tennela, your hometown. &gt;&gt; Uh tensions between the humans and the dwarves are are escalating after a series of sabotage incidents in key cities, uh which is leading to a rising hostility. Apparently, there's some sort of outside force that is trying to pit the humans and the dwarves against each other to break the Federation apart. Look at that. Interior strife. Civil War. Uh, mission number four, which you said you wanted when you just went blind. I don't know that that's still true. Um, but this is back in your hometown of Mory. Gh, &gt;&gt; I'm out. &gt;&gt; An ancient necropolis deep within the heart of Mory, known as the tomb of the first technommancer, has reactivated after centuries of dormcancy. &gt;&gt; Gh, you would love it. &gt;&gt; The ancient machines have started to malfunction, threatening to unleash a catastrophic chain reaction that could devastate the entire kingdom. Are you sensing a pattern here that they were like, "Oh, something's going to go wrong and the whole kingdom's going to fall apart if like nobody helps us." You you get that, right? &gt;&gt; Are all kingdoms seem kind of screwed right now? &gt;&gt; Well, that is what the keeps the terror did in business, honestly. Cuz if everything were just like hugs and high fives, they wouldn't need an international peacekeeping force, right? That's true. &gt;&gt; Well, there's one more industrial complex. &gt;&gt; Is the last one in Lake Operance? &gt;&gt; It is. You've caught on to the pattern, huh? Look at that. A deadly plague has broken out amongst the pirate crews of Leo, spreading rapidly and threatening to decimate the entire Dominion of Leo. The captains suspect that the plague is being spread by an enemy fleet seeking to weaken Leo before launching a fullscale invasion. &gt;&gt; I have a question. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, we uh uh we understand the gods of all these places except for us. So far that's according to your briefings you have encountered the gods from everywhere but yes why is that &gt;&gt; I am not a theologian ran I am a facilitator &gt;&gt; what if we &gt;&gt; but like &gt;&gt; is this anything &gt;&gt; is that reference &gt;&gt; I don't &gt;&gt; no your kids are going to love it &gt;&gt; what if we go to and try to figure out who that is &gt;&gt; I personally am in favor of helping the short folk Well, I wanted to go back to Leo to see his old man cuz we used to kick it. &gt;&gt; We don't need to go back to Leo. We don't That seemed like the lowest stake issue by far. &gt;&gt; Also, weren't you a pirate, Stone Bread? &gt;&gt; Oh, space pirate. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I mean, look, I mean, you need different pirates. Space pirates. &gt;&gt; You know how to handle different This is racism. &gt;&gt; I want to go to &gt;&gt; Yeah.

That's the uh &gt;&gt; We outvoted you. I switch my vote to go to Leo then. &gt;&gt; Boom, my man. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; so now it's a clean rule. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. Well, &gt;&gt; could have been an advantage. &gt;&gt; I didn't really have a choice. Well, okay then. &gt;&gt; How about instead you do a test of strength? &gt;&gt; Why do you have dice on you? &gt;&gt; That's He is a gambling man. Okay, here we go.

It's pirate season. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Don't you feel like &gt;&gt; And we could go back to where we came from. &gt;&gt; Don't you think it's crazy our mission giver like kind of wanted us to do one of them? &gt;&gt; Not really. &gt;&gt; It's not my job. I would say I don't put a finger on the scale cuz I don't have fingers. &gt;&gt; I just feel like &gt;&gt; I want to meet your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] father. &gt;&gt; I feel like it would be better if Lego was gone. &gt;&gt; That is crazy. &gt;&gt; I wish the circle of truth was here right now so it would tell me that you're kidding. You see uh a shot comes floating over from the bar and just lands right in front of you. And you see she's like, "I realize we're on duty, but you seem a little wound up. Maybe like a little something to sort of take the edge off." &gt;&gt; Fine. &gt;&gt; Come on. Just have it, bro. &gt;&gt; Rip that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Rip that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm going to drink my special ale, which is basically like 20 shots in one. &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; He's been really weird about the special talking about it a lot. &gt;&gt; It's special from &gt;&gt; Yeah. I I always just take sips of his shits. I want to pay. That is not alcohol. &gt;&gt; So, we're going we're going where you're going. I'm spoiling your secret. &gt;&gt; All right.

I've &gt;&gt; kill yourself. &gt;&gt; Um, okay. So, uh, listen, um, I don't really have a vested interest in this, so you you boys can go to Leo and you see like, uh, folders come like floating out and landing in front of you, uh, with the details of the mission. Uh, and she says, "Get your things together and then deploy when you're ready." &gt;&gt; All right, sounds good. &gt;&gt; Hey, shaved. &gt;&gt; Where's DJ?

Does she know this? &gt;&gt; Did you tell her you're separated? Yeah, because or is that just what you're telling like the other young toids that you run into? Like if you've got a reptile kink, I am not here to judge. &gt;&gt; You're a bit of a flooy. &gt;&gt; Just saying. Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; Bit of a hoe. &gt;&gt; A little bit. Little bit of an absentee. &gt;&gt; I'm not drinking anymore. And it weirds everybody out. &gt;&gt; He's most assuredly drinking. I'm telling you. &gt;&gt; So, think about that.
