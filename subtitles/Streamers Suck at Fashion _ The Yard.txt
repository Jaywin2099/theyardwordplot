 who's your favorite player on the team don't do this to boy racing clean you said boy ra clean oh my teammate hit that and of TS watch where it respawns me isn't that sick a mile behind all right so I get a I wait wait stop we're not going to continue the conversation unless zipper control Zooms in and crops out the Crocs why are no that is literally the only way I engage in this conversation you don't have to engage what it actually works better without you yeah we don't care L bro okay hey everybody Welcome to the yard podcast can you zoom out zipper so I I get a picture from uh cutie Cinderella in the middle of the night and day um and this is 2 p.m. uh which is night time somewhere and it's the night of the day uh and she says I need you to help me well first she just says I need help which I was a little worried about sure there was no photo and then the photo came in and she said I need to know if this is a good outfit or not he says it's a good outfit I say it's not a good outfit he and then he said that if you remove the Crocs from the equation it's a good outfit okay and she said uh the Crocs need to be removed and also without them it's still a bad outfit and then she asked for my input oh interesting so that's why he wants the Crocs out of the equation so I I I automatically was like well lwig you can't just say take the Crocs out cuz that's part of the outfit that was the whole my mind went straight to business I was like we must have dropped the Croc sponsorship they must be out you you know L you know he he shifted the goalpost you know she was like she said something about his outfit he's like what it's a fine outfit it's a good outfit and and then she was like no it sucks and he's like minus the Crocs first thing I said I get the Crocs AR all that by the way I get so many compliments more than you get in a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] week on these voice boys from who kids cuties and Ne they do they do this at your feet and you're like yeah another one yeah Dixie walks in she goes really cool Crocs and I go want thank you they think cutie is like a special education worker these look tight I get so many looks ironically funny yeah they're awesome but they're not like awes they don't make it like a good outfit in the way that like I think you want it to be what when you're like oh what don't don't loest Griffin me I feel like you think that it's the like okay no Crocs what do we think I think it's fine I don't care I think there's a great outfit coms get involved in this one the comments should get involved here here's what happened is all comes back to me after messaging Nick and she goes he said it was bad and I said without the Crocs and she goes yeah and I was like and I was like what the hell is that all about okay there's a lot going on here I'm wearing fine china opinion time so I'm I'm the Men's Work Weare guy of uh podcasting yeah um everyone's always asking where that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] jacket came from that guy should get a podcast yeah I I think he's just afraid of showing his face cuz people want to kill him no one knows what he looks like no I think they do I don't think they know what he looks like cuz if they knew what he looks like everything would change cuz then he would have to be up to the standard that he projects on other people I'm pretty sure he is though it'd be really funny if he has like a Star Wars t-shirt that's what I mean like or he might just be like ugly and then it's like do matter how you dress kind of right in a way people judge cargo shorts pick dude cargo with the high rule yeah yeah cargo with the high rule you know what I like you know what I like about him is that he posts examples of what he does like that that fixes it all if he was only if he was a pure ha only critical it'd be bad yeah U all right here so your die work where so here's my issue okay he's got two very conflicting patterns on the top and bottom what and the bottom ones the bottom ones they aren't camo but they read his camo like people think he's wearing camo yes but they aren't camo they're like a they're kind of like a they're kind of like a acid Dy or like a paint splatter type of VI it cost $1,400 uh I don't know it's free I don't know I can't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pay for my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ever okaying cuti got them for me the pants are kind of baggy but like the top isn't like it's like you know normally with the baggy pants you want to do like the T-shirt so it's kind of thin up top big down bottom or the opposite big ass jacket thinner pants pants or something you want to look like a he's kind of you know he's kind of just like a condom he's just kind of like you know so in my opinion I think it's a bad outfit I was thinking about fashion the other day you were thinking about fashion the other day think about it yeah the other day you thought about fashion and now you're gay really that's what I thought you think it's gay I thought was gay yeah but Mater cross fake and gay also gay actually I think you was thinking you're gay I think and then I was thinking I kissing boys would be that bad hang out boys all day why looking at Dicks on Reddit dude low key this is L we's Awakening I was thinking why we like hanging out with our Bros why don't we just freaking hang out with them all the time all the time like it's some sort of like Union of love I don't know maybe it was stupid I guess I want L I want to understand cuz I'm not I'm not trying to rag on you please I am I you're not try hold on you're not trying to rag on I'm trying to get down you're trying a lot of fire I want to know like when you pick out when you pick up this outfit and you're like I like this outfit this is good do you like is there was there an option that you were like n I don't want this and then you put the other thing on or are you just putting [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on kind of in like chronological I see them order well okay yeah so I put on a different pair of pants and I went too cold and then I switched the warmer pants which were these ones which is these are my warmest pants I have and then I went so pants are on first pants are on your shirt list with pants for yeah almost always okay and then shoes I had running shoes and I was like I don't want to tie them those then I had dress shoes and I was like I don't want to tie those so I went with Crocs right okay and then this is actually have an aversion to like do like tying shoes once again like a child so you shot a shirt with buttons you're like I don't want to button that you saw a jacket with a zipper I don't want to that and then I saw the sweater and I was like that looks nice whoa I see so you're tunnel visioning on the items pause I wish you were ugly man I wish three different people CH your outfit

sorry scare you I does scare me I'm not as scared of the kid scared I hung out with 9-year-olds all day yesterday is that true yeah well not only nine it was like seven six it was 11 nine was more of a placeholder to represent all the ages like a median maybe did you have them like do math at each other like what was your we did reading oh we did reading Green Eggs and Ham they read to you you were they read to me they' correct me if I got the words wrong it's a long book dude you know what uh uh you know when Aiden Ross couldn't read the word fascist and like someone did an analysis and I was talking to someone who's actually she's a pre not preschool teacher like first grade teacher she's like yeah the way that we like started teaching kids how to read is way more [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up than the way we all learned like they changed it instead of phonics you like it's like a whole word system and it's like making people actually Dumber so she was like yeah it's pretty normal like you have to learn whole words at once you learn how a weird thing you have to like you have to look it up they were too Hooked on Phonics we got to get them off that kids the kids are addicting pH put on whole words and that GMO [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] uh but yeah it's kind of interesting and they're like the the person who like made up this ideology that got taken up is like being sued for like bad education oh that's awesome the kids are uh the kids are getting brainwashed they're getting rid of Australia they're getting rid of it yeah what what they're getting rid of Australia the kid Australia going I thought it was GRE what thought we're getting rid of Greenland well that's an American politics thing I'm saying this is not a political thing no this is a young education thing I was reading I was reading a book I was sounding out all the words yeah and it was going through all the continents and then when you read they has a like this is America and you trace your finger through it's a puzzle and you get to see all the things in America and I was going through all the continents America Africa South America Europe the other two and then eventually it gets to Australia but it didn't call it Australia it called it australasia australasia and I've never heard that before maybe it was just a typo no that's not a typo this is a printed book book which famously don't does have typos thank you can we look yeah no books have can we look up austral Asia maybe this is because when people refer to that continent they sometimes mean the surrounding the surrounding islands and things well that's part of it no a part of Australia yeah I don't know it's part of well Oceana I guess is they wanted to be more representative that's a region for video games lwi Oceana no no Oceana is another term for the continent no it's a region for video games it's not just a video game thing not just a video game the video game thing then why have I only heard it in that context you only play video games most of your de zipper zipper stop looking up nine-year-olds and look up austral Asia zipper we're going to take away that metal that we got you for the rockathon we're going to take that away Congressional medal of Medal of War it wasp purple heart cuz he got wounded couldn't stop jacking off while we were doing this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] thing uh you did spell it wrong zipper australasia you got to close Minecraft you got [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] podcast no way yeah see they changed it oh so this is why they changed it sub region of Oceania I didn't know this but apparently they change that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I mean it says 1756 huh maybe they're just using this term now and it's been around for a long time they might have come up with it a while ago but now I'm saying it's in the kids books and if it's in the kids books that's what the kids are going to call it when they take over the world and you think that the kids it's Australia raser I think it's I think it's Australia eraser or oceanana eraser yeah cuz you're the Cook Islands aren't in this and we're calling the Gulf of Mexico Pomona now we should MH we should God bless amen I would be I would be fine with that can we buy it can we afford to buy the golf of Mexico I don't we bid don't we own a good chunk of it no I mean us the podcast the yard Oh weird you didn't know what I meant s I'm looking at this y I don't think he knows how much money we got no we got we're rolling in it right now I can see how much money we got how expensive could it be it's good um I think we should go in like how you know how everyone's bid on Tik Tok yeah we should been on the golf of Mexico sneak in why everyone's distracted by Tik Tok surely the people who can afford the golf of Mexico can't afford buy both but they're the but it's the same group of people right the demand demand for Tik Tok Skyrocket supply of Tik Tok is going there there's one still there's still one there's still one but it's and the demand for the golf is going down because they don't have enough money so we could surely get a bid in well what you know what I learned is rich people auctions are different like what do they what do they buy and you getting invited to that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] not even that rich but like the eBay auctions in my day it's like you snipe at last second you get it you know oh yeah everyone's turned a blind eye but in the rich people auctions they you put they bring up like they bring up like a guy on the stage he's got a bag on his head yeah well you're at the rich people and you you have to bring your paddle raise your P the guy dances a bit so how's it explain the age of the guy which is Trends to the lower side and but anyway if somebody bids then there's a new timer it resets every new bid so you can't snipe it anymore I think that's fine why is this a rich people thing this is is this just a better system that's just like an auction better system eBay how Bing works on everything that is in eBay yeah I well I like know contextualized through eBay you know why eBay is bad I actually think I think all bidding is bad cuz it's buying with extra steps but it's like they have Bots that just bid on your own item no they said a number they don't want it to be under and then you bid and it automatically that's a person no it's a bot that's a guy bro you're telling me that's back that's haircut dude 11c dud 11 he wants these when I been on the Legend of Zelda four Swords Adventure when I was a kid mhm and then I got instantly out pit after putting in $25 mhm that was that was a man with a job a man or a robot well it might no not necess I don't know why you guys are putting this on the Bots cuz I used to do this with your own items yeah i' sell did you take that copy of four Swords adventure for me I'd sell an item I'd log into my second account and and somebody bid 10 bucks andd be like it's 15 now why wouldn't you just set it at a eBay loves this right cuz for eBay it just say you win your own item you pay the fee cuz if you set it the Fe if you set it at a price then you have to deal with stocking fees CU you don't know how long that's going to sit in your Warehouse I listen I will say a warehouse when you were my mother's house it's so much more expensive than when I was a kid if you bought it you would have made Min you should have bought 100 C made I would have made about 403 maybe cuz eBay people set the price and they can just put whatever they want what's the cable that comes with that game H up yeah you could hook it up to a game Bo because there was another Zelda game dude there we are surely not the first ones to think about the eBay has been around for 25 years yeah we have not they have solved this really longer right oh like this is probably one of the first things they thought of and we're sitting here like we're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] smart yeah we are we're we're Wicked smart you're wearing the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cross you go you go into the you go into the bidding little window and you type in the like the power effective iPhone turnoff message oh my God it's 30 years old this isn't a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] joke bro it's older than Aiden it's 29 to be clear slightly younger than me that's all I'm saying I don't like that eBay came out and then shortly after I was born you just say 30 and passing conversation what did my parents buy on eBay you know like why was it why did it come out and then like shortly like a 12 months later I was born yeah they bought something romantic think about that I feel like wouldn't help that they bought a u for 3 months the impregnator they actually got the Lilo Hugo to no free what if they bought Seaman on eBay and then you got pregnant with the SE she would have some kids know you paid price you bid on like famous people SE yeah bro like Cameo dream do dream Seaman on eBay would be crazy and they have their testimonials imagine you're a celebrity who done fell off you're George Lopez right like you fell off but like adults love you what is this it's not SE it's not load boost get load Bo to the load boost dude you guys didn't want to do the Viagra episode can we take this instead what we got see we got to see who can fill a cup yeah oh my God he we're watching porn the whole time back back up this idea sucks jio rules jiz yeah why did we get off jio cuz he wanted to come and each other I was like you talk we brought up Seaman and then started thinking about come what is what's Jia look like okay so you want George Lopez Seaman because you want to make a baby that's also famous right so you so you bid on George Lopez jizz and you have to be a girl so I'm to bid cuz guys aren't going to use it for good no veto the guys can drive up the price that's the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] free market there's no robots there's just guys if you're a Die Hard fan of George Lopez maybe you put that on your wall instead of like a sign Jersey yeah or like a fat Ed okay well then okay can girls post products on jio yeah why not they can post their own seen okay no wait wait wait was like how do you put it on the wall I get it I get it you invite your friends over and you're like you know watch this flick that little light switch over there it's a black light like see all that seing on that wall That's George Lopez's you make splatter art yeah and it says run it's George Lopez splatter art that's why eyes and then there would be more demand for you know service like that uh that goes to like the hotel room that rayj and Kim K had sex and like finds all the seamen that's still there and yeah they like cut out the whole drywall yeah and then there's like a black market jizo j. onion jio could work you pay premium and then when the kid turns 18 the person you bought it from shows up guy who wants to be on jiz j. iio yep yeah that's huge well you first you can play the game with a snake that eats other snakes when you get bored yeah when you're waiting for your your option to come in you play Snake no this could work I'm sure this is a thing how much you think guys think my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nut would go you they wouldn't take it what we've gone

it a good amount of it maybe an inch or two of rainfall fire can go through it was dumping it was loud at the office all I know fire can go through rain says who says the Australians says the Australians exist oh look at RIS of toxic Ash run off it's always something it's my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stupid chongus life man Z look up can fires go through rain look up the Australian fires no look up Australian Fire Let's speed australasian fires look up the australasian fires you're so insensitive comma rain went through question mark wait I'm not done searching yep uh I want the AI version I can't believe you got there give me AI give me dude I I have a homie uh okay he point well L's wrong nice no what do you mean you're you're on l City right now this this is proving my point the fires put out the rain but not all of it you went to the L bath house and everyone saw your penis what this a w bath house they don't see my penis no you went to the L bath house and everyone remembered what your penis was like cuz you've been there so many times it's one of those Instagram mobile games but instead of 2 Xing guns it's 2 Xing and halfing the size of your penis and at the end you're walking into a bath house and the people who play AI versions always walk with tiny and then this gets remade in Roblox for some reason and it's way and it's actually way better I show speed plays it on stream and he's got an insane thing at the very end there's a community note that says the gameplay actually isn't like this this is like a predatory uh game and we get and we get what's his name Anthony star is that his name the guy from the boys Tony star Anthony star yes sir yeah you seen that his mobile his mobile game ads no oh yeah they locked him on a crazy deal cuz he's doing like he's like this is the game that's not like the fake ones on Instagram wow you how what's the bag you think he's getting I got no clue I I see famous people do ads all the time and I wonder I wonder why how much how much you think money line paid Mr Beast for the Beast games how much who pay who you know how in the middle of Beast games he'll be like in money lines giving away half a mill for free to a random viewer yeah how much do you think that he got for that yes the in this clip he's being like like like can you play the Audio I want to hear his voice in the beginning and he's like clearly fake playing here yeah he looks oh this is like homelander yeah yeah man he's got a lot of work sis had some work done he got paid uh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on I think he got paid less than he put in the developers made a real game based off the fake game I mean this game looks fire like that's why why don't they that's that's a good question why not just make it and then they got homelander to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] advertise it to me I think they they they celebrities they have made it several times I think we should I think that should be our end game like when we realize that we're falling off it's over we should come out with a like a mobile game gambling the yeah this been done research chemical selling Dude Perfect did this 10 years ago really I played through all the YouTuber games last week and dude perfect has a game called Dude Perfect Two and and in it you like I feel like it should be like quop but it's the Dude Perfect it's kind of like they're like shooting a basketball it's kind of like the original Bloons but like shittier and then you buy crystals to play more oh and after every single time you play it says post it to Facebook because it's 10 years old and it's one of the worst games i' ever played does it have the one man is it like cut outs of their heads and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's just like your favorite it's just the main dude you don't get to pick between you

like flee to the beach to like escape the fires and ride it out cuz there's water there and yeah and there's and their house burned down it makes a lot of sense that's where I would go the coast he's adding he's adding me in the Moi chat and it says like hey man like hope everything's good out there like her's pretty rough and I'm like it's it's like it's not like your situation it's like he's he's like empathetically connecting with me and I'm like it's not that bad I didn't was it trapped on the be many people it is but like we didn't evacuate well you didn't that's what I'm saying I thought you said I was like they I'm not talk about those I think I'm underestimating how bad it is to be outside cuz if you you go to like the line where uh houses burned down and you're trying and like now cuz they're letting people rumage through their like stuff and whatever like they're give they give you you have to wear a hazmat suit yeah it's and I think I'm underestimating how bad being outside in general is I hit the bag the other day in my yard and I'm like breathing heavy and then I and then the next day I was like you got The Black Lung I think it got to me I think if you if you're in those areas closer to it it's still it's I wonder how far away you need to be I think if you're in like the area we are now you don't notice anything that's what I'm saying but like yeah like how gra like how gradual is it I think it is pretty quick though it falls off it's interesting too like you guys are saying like you know there there's a Stolen Valor because you live in a like I I was on the line of like you got to go yeah and I left and nothing burned down but like so close to me is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] burned down and I'm like it's it's a world of difference even though I had to leave and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] even though I like was affected quote unquote it's like some people just lost everything I was basically feel like I'm the equivalent of someone who served but like only in America I'm Co guard guard and like I'm still getting my discounts at Goodwill yeah I'm still it's just so much different than someone who did a tour in Afghanistan I feel like I got I I was I was there for the tour and then I got discharged really quickly cuz like cuz like my Nintendo switch was still at the house that is they discharged you for that that is like your your dad I was I was worried sick about Nintendo I played World of Warcraft in a Barracks for 9 months and I just never saw combat and like I don't know you imagine losing a second breath of the wild save with almost no

game we don't know how to play without started the fire played Rockman forgot to stream yeah love dude how funny would it be in an alternate world it's like every time there's a fire they like call us up and like we tour we need you to rock yeah literally go on tour as like a band with it's rock that is like the plot of like a Nickelodeon show yeah it'd be so funny A's so bald you can see his brain

XX Shadow Beast it was it was he mad I saying he's wasn't like mad at a guy like in personal stuff it's like a calculated move yeah I I think he did it because he he was worried that if this person

when you're insatiable it's so fun and you don't like that you want to be bottled up and contained I think if I could live my entire life with lwig at my side just in that mode of being insatiable with wanting attention I'd be a happier guy dud I had a whole thought I was wondering how I was wondering how the inner working of a had a whole ass thought I was wondering how the inner workings of Best Buy worked yesterday and I knew and I knew lwig I knew lwig was on vacation which meant he was interested in talking to me oh so I was like I'm going to hit a blood I'm ask a bunch of questions about Best Buy he answered so fast he didn't answer are you mad at me I'm like to the guys who I'm like did the guys who man manage you also manage The Geek Squad guys same people or he's like well he's like same people and I'm like what about just a pass thought want to know want to know I'm like what about Magnolia and he's like he's like yeah the general manager manages all people and I'm like like thanks love magol cashier Magnolia is different no it's not it's just a different department Geek Squad why do they wear why do they wear different outfits just a different apartment are they all Best Buy employees all under the Best Buy umbrella okay but what about is there a Geek Squad LLC I think at some point but Best Buy Best Buy brought B do they still act as an operative LLC maybe a sub no LLC LLC how do you know this I don't know I worked there it's like in uh it's always sunny when they're talking about gay sex and like do a power bottom have to do with power and power speed has everything speed has everything to do with it Max guys I'm bummed out what are you bummed out about wrong man I didn't get to see gran tusla last night what you didn't come too it's like more of like a it's not a punishment it kind of is a punishment if he comes every night multiple times a night and you've already come but you keep coming Aiden seems to want to provide something some of us can't see Grant tusla in the way you can what that that a wishbone I think uh I think if you break this in half and make a wish grusa will visit you I guess what or what I'm wondering is how do people get off without grusa cuz she comes to me every night is that a Hugo 2 prostate massager from Le is Nick and you don't have to break it you can just use it and you don't and grusa will visit you every night I choose hypothetical sense that's so awesome so you're telling me is something that can only be done at night if you've been bad all day no lwi that's the thing you don't have to be bad to enjoy the Hugo to but how do you use it when you're sleeping that's you probably don't use it when you're sleeping you don't that is probably the one exception you want to be awake and alert while you use it to enjoy you know the the Casual pleasure pleasure well how do you feel about eight different pleasure settings I wouldn't know how to control it without some sort of app or something like what am I supposed to use that's the thing it's app connected lwig for you you could have the app on your phone to control it your partner could be controlling the app Blu could I put it in and then give the app to grusa so that grus could use it from afar no no because Wi-Fi gives grusa cancer so she doesn't what it's true grus was very sensitive my problem is that it does it have more power than a previous generation because we have the old ones you think they would make the two and give it less power than the previous generation you're asking dumb questions well I heard it has sense motion technology and you can move the remote in any directions you can intensify the vibrations too and the fun doesn't stop there use our unique stackable discount code the yard5 for an

I guess the the the the content of it but Caleb Pitts is living at my house but not what we're you know we're riding a show J Pitts lives at my house and we're bald yeah we're love so what I don't think that's a problem I think it's a problem and you're doing it you're writing a show a show yeah yeah we're we're finally buckling down we work like at 9 to5 dude I wake up at [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 8:30 now it's uh wait so did you work before the podcast today no no we're going we delayed Mondays so today we're going late yeah we got a little Riders room going we're like making a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] show yeah I have a guy in the room I just punch him I have a guy I just punch that's a punch guy bring that naked PA out here naked PA we're going to punch we're all going to get a punch in on him and then it's so nice bro you relieve so much stret when you punch the guy oh my God just recreating cuz sometimes whimpers what and it's like thank you I needed that I need my like my physical release to require like have a whimper at the end of it right so it's just like riding [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's like Hollywood we're we're in an air conditioning war with the other people in our building oh dude I'm going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] slap the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of those people I don't know what's going on there's an air conditioning unit and it's on the wall and when we flip it to cold or sorry sorry when we turn it off they come back out and they flip at the cold and I've never we've never passed each other in the hallway so we we come out and we turn off come out they put it cold we come back out we turn it off they come out put cold I'm I'm going to put why do you turn it off cuz [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they make it I'm not kidding 54 dude it's like it's like they're maxing it out I can see my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] breath and I want to put I want to put a black bag over their head bro it's because a they really like it that freaking cold or B the temperature doesn't get to their they got a grow room that doesn't make sense you don't know how Grow rooms work CU they're using heat lamps this makes perfect sense they wouldn't be hanging out in the grow room you doing there but it makes sense what I said Chill Spot to hang out they would be regulating temperature spot to hang out no you make it hot for the weed yeah but you'd have the heat lamps in it's really chill spot to hang out and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] talk like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's I don't know man the joke specifically makes sense because there's hot stuff in the room so they're using it for temperature regulation just doesn't logically logically does sat in a logically break it down I literally sat in a girl room you don't seem like room before from all the things you smoked a big spliff I don't actually know what they do zipper yell I want to go I want to go knock and if because if they have a good reason then I'm like all right true I'll I'll go buy a heater so you need you assume bad reason you want to see Good Reason um I assume no reason but I yeah it's just annoy but I fight for my right to be not cold borderline terrorism to keep a public indoor space at 54° it's so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] well the problem it just affects all the offices but I will I we should do we should drill like a case over it like with a key yeah like while they're not looking and then they try to come change it and you know what Caleb's idea was you put a note on it that says please do not lower this below this temperature Dash management Management's good yeah yeah that's clean that is clean put that note on that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you guys are going to enter [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] passive aggressive War okay there's there's also two air conditioning units and one is not for us and one is for us we put a note on the one for us the gay one it says this is the gay AC weuse it we can't use it neither can they we want it off you turn it off turn it off we made the gay one and then they can't use it and we can't use it or or maybe you do like a little like voice box and then you be like I'm super gay turn me on and then it's off and then oh and like tou it I don't want to freaking turn you on you don't know who's running the grow up though you they could be gay Growers I mean it's likely it's it's Los Angeles California it's Los Angeles California speaking of speaking of R in our show L you want to fund it you want to give me a couple million dollars I'm cool off that you a million dollars cool off that appreciate you give me some money apprciate you lost a lot this past year we're flush though no but this is an investment we can give it away you're going to get this one back in to get this one back dude you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] being you don't need money we yeah we do so many money you don't need any money you don't have a script what there's no script we you talking about his script you no we we're done with a pilot you got [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sucker you got to write that whole [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] before you start shopping for money no the idea it's actually the opposite it's actually the I learned that I didn't know this either though I didn't know this either it's all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up cuz if you if you write the whole show if you write the whole show and then you go sell it then they make you rewrite the entire thing because they have to pay you for the time spent on creating it CU they own it so they can't own it if you pre-wrote it so you have to rewrite it anyways so that's why you only write the pilot you sell the pilot and then you write the season yes Aiden bald student balding student bald non-traditional student what is it what can we help do with uh what what but aren't I thought they're buying the script not paying for your time I don't understand no they're buying they have to they have to own both legally so they they make you rewrite it so that's why most people just write a pilot and then when they sell the pilot they write the rest and they'll usually like secretly like on the low have an idea of where everything's going and then when they go to the writer room they bring those ideas to the table wow but we're not doing that cuz we're going Indie bro do you want to be a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] big shot with us you want big shot we get you look your cock's going to be famous if you do this whoa okay I'm in I'm talking big Winer on a you'll never go to the L bath house again you'll only be W bath house from now on if you go to the bath house after [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] making it big with this they will worship you do you understand scrub bad thing free scrubs I don't know if you want to be worshiped in the back you know you know I learn what what do you want you do kind of want to be middle of the pack at the back you want to be kind of unnoticed what do you guys thing Workaholics got for a per episode budget for season one season one season one I'll give you a you want a hint 17,000 you want a hint no no hints okay no hints $177,000 an episode I have no reference I don't know low budget I I don't enjoy guessing an episode $750,000 an episode [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy my God that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy they shot their pilot for 50k and then Tom Central made them re-shoot it with the full budget and they got a 750 per episode episode bu it I wonder if the pilot they shot was lowkey like a little funnier cuz like maybe they nailed lines better I think it probably wasn't imagine cuz I've seen cuz like the work of hog guys they had M male Order Comedy which was like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like 18 years ago and then they did uh fifth year and it's none of it's funny but it's basically all Workaholics was it always Sunny's first season super low budget too yeah the the joke was they shot it for $50 and then they they shot the they shot the first the pilot the first pilot they sold for that isn't in the real show for like 50 and they're it was like on some YouTube [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we shot a show for $50 yeah they they they joke that the which is technically true that the camera in your cell phone is better than the camera they shot season one through four with one through four the ones that went to TV yeah and that's why the the the idea behind that is like just go make [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] just use your phone go make your movie don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] don't try don't even [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sell it just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] shoot it don't worry about the money aspect go make your movie don't look up if all the League of Legends characters are naked and you can use it for porn bro the boys have a Discord so the Australians have a Discord server and it's just I bet that's an easy transition we can imagine equals and it's just all like dude they are on this Tom kench kick where it's just his big meaty nasty dick in all kinds of all sorts of messes all sorts of situations cut it up and make a Crudo oh my so nasty that's gross theim you go in there and they're like talking about about like oh that's a bad day on the rift good day on the rift and then just Tom kench's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] wet penis like what are they just spamming it back and forth yeah yeah when it's appropriate yeah like give
