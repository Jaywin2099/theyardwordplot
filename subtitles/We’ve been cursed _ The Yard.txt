singed fog I waited out and I finally come finally come back into the studio I sit back down in the chair slime leaves after I sit down I'm like okay I guess we're not rolling without lwig we're goofing around he comes back he comes back wearing the same hoodie as me hey what about this guy he finds it hilarious okay so then he goes and finds just a version of the hoodie we never even made a worse version with an embroidery it's better this was like the V1 the the v.5 puffy puffy so here we are at the Mario Party League here we are wearing all the same clothes you know what I feared I feared there was like a group chat and it was like an emergency we have to wear the green hoodie and then I was going to be on the hook twice yeah cuz I was late and I missed the green hoodie memo yeah that would have been so I'm glad you just farted and wor [Applause] it it's just where your mouth is it's it's like come on can you think of a Nick did say Nick did say you farted in my chair and then slime said no it's just just where your mouth would be yeah he's been consistent on this for like s years I like I've said does that make it right say what you will no I'm I'm defending you don't

their property well is my mouth not my proper i f where your mouth would be I didn't fart in your mouth fart's surely going to do more damage to his mouth than it would the chair if he sits down in it well no cuz the issue with Nick is he never washes his pants he doesn't so if you fart in his chair how are we going to make this about me because you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] your pants once and you didn't

reverse egos what about fresh never Frozen jeans fresh never Frozen jeans these are freshz now it Wendy's I got the square jeans like Wendy's what was the end pole uh I would say if in the battle this conversation started between me and Anna and in that Battlefield I think the poll supports me however the winner technically was two to three times uh but the second runner up by a lot was five plus well for what is the context the context is how many times will you willingly wear a pair of jeans before washing it which this conversation started because Anna said every time I wear something I wash it it doesn't matter what it is she was wearing a brand new hoodie with like a crisp logo and I said so after this event event where you sat still all day on a cold day even you're not even sweating on a cold day too yeah it was cold in a room that smells nice lwi yeah uh smelled wonderful you're going to go home and you're going to wash that hoodie and she said yes it actually smelled bad in the room I'm I'll try me that it smell bad it smell bad in the room unless slime was in the room I didn't smell I don't smell bad you smell like a leag player you got stinky yeah you got stinky

I I was at Lacs so he hasn't grinded because he doesn't care anyway so we're look gaming is back on the menu and we're eating it with our whole asses we're eating it with our fingers dude I forgot how to play batro because of so much League you forgot I don't I well I just got it on my phone and I was playing it for like 3 hours during the uh the block we weren't doing yeah I Ain win one time oh no I feel like a stone dead idiot I've lost my gaming skills yeah you repl you saved over all the memories with fiddle on like the EAS you didn't win a single run I didn't win a single run on the easiest modes the one that like a child Coulda figure out the child could figure the children of the world could figure out for the game of the year batro that's pronounced batro not batro I want in there I want to see it there's nothing in there you got a why do you have your passport cuz I'm traveling tomorrow on you yeah wait he's leaving I'm leaving where going yeah where you going where you going I'm going to France want to all right thank you those are nice pants lewig would you wash them today when you get home you think well corduroy yeah it's not raw denim corduroys everywhere well you hit the wash with the one time wear on those on the corduroys yeah but like you're fine you're not sweating you're not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nasty for me how often do you do laundry in general me yeah bro doesn't do laundry dude he doesn't do it cuz I don't know if I buy that you're washing something after after one wear not because you don't want to because I don't think you wash things that often my last wash dry was thinking about his hard the kind of the answer two weeks ago that's not bad not bad at all two weeks ago and was that with those pant my witness were those were the pants in there no I'm actually running out that's why I'm wearing the the these are not these are like a back rotation wait are you different now do you do the laundry oh now now you come crawling in when was the last time you did laundry literally last night okay you're different uh I I want to do laundry but I have an issue with cutie that makes it hard issue with her it out which she will hear this I know she'll hear this and I've told her this which of the yard men will you tell i' the yard the yard Council yard council help me I have an issue have an issue tell the yard Magi that we rack up a lot of clothes yeah yeah famously and cue bound and we use a laundry service yeah you recall I don't like the laundry service because they're they be mixing the clothes they be mixing the clothes mixing the clothes you explain more it'll be like a stack of shirts and it's half cuties half mine right and they be mixing the clothes wait wait wait that is your fault no no no I've sent it in separate bags you sent do you include in the instructions no that's your fault guys this is what happens when you have dumb [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] money is you just send your clothes off to a school they've mixed our clothes for the children to yeah and then come back mixed look and that so I thought well I don't have that many clothes I'll just throw a quick loaded well you shoot threw away the Duke vitro shirt so yeah you don't this is this is this is the logic thread we're following here is like they don't sort the clothes properly at the laundry company wow I could just do the laundry myself and it's taking wow and it was a hard four year Road another classic lwi case of they can't do it like me oh my God I do it different and even so I do that and then cutie brings up a point which I don't think it's invalid but it puts me out a Crossroads where she goes you're only doing your load okay dude yeah yeah and I'm like she she you know and I mean this and I mean this respectfully she does your loads she wouldn't ask she she she uses the service she doesn't do she no she's she's she's done my Lo she would do the she's done the load she's done my loads yeah wait wait she's never refused hold on hold on what it's not even it's not even a question she just does the load without asking it that's right yeah yeah but you can still passively refuse a load she's never thought to just refuse a load think about it when we when we all live together and the laundry room was like right in the center of like the you know the house and we would we would before the laundry service came she would do the loads in front of everybody yeah well okay I feel like there's it was out in Broad day it was it was out I would see her do she would take your load and then she would go do it has a way of making a load feel unrefusable now that I think about find phrase like that I I've never said don't refuse my load you didn't have to say it yeah like you cannot say a lot of things but still very much CU I feel like it's a weird to pay a like a guy you don't know to do the load for you yeah that's not the that's not the way to you're say here stranger receive my load rece for money for money and for money and he have to drive all out there he shows up at the door he takes the load and gets money and gets money people pay for that I just feel like but the but then the load comes back mixed and then it comes back all I'm saying is we've gone full circle it's like we're coming CU was doing the loads some random guy was doing the loads and now you're trying to do your own load but you're not taking hers I'm not taking I'm not taking care of hers yeah so what happened um did you have to did you accidentally reinvent doing the laundry together what we had a machine and it did it for us and then we had all the clothes would be wet we need like a second machine got be a way to do the second part of the washing of well hold on I just hang the clothes up until we find a second machine it takes a long time the air might I don't like that either I well I'm coming back to Nick's strategy which is what which is sort and let them know what wait what sort the bags yeah yeah sort and let them know and let what do you mean let them know you let you stand out there with a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crowbar I got let them [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they show up I let them know let let them know I I'll slip like a take my load the way I want it put I put a gun in one of the bags when they open it well then they get a free gun that's a bad idea yeah they'll then they'll bring it use on you keep your clothes what then then your your I'm I'm I just want to make sure I'm I'm correct here yeah please because it seems like you gave gave up on the laundry service you tried doing laundry you did your laundry and KY was like why didn't you do mine and your solution to this is to go back to the laundry company okay that's so badass you're like God God forbid I touch my girlfriend's clothes I would know what to do with all that is gross is would know what to do with all the particulars what you going do and such all the delicates would you would you have touch the delicates I delicates cuz sometimes you got to move the delicates it's disrespectful to touch a woman's underwear you I'm watching cloth water hottest as possible highest tumble setting and then I'm blasting the heat if there if there was a hardcore setting and not a delicate setting I would use it on all my clothes I'm trying to make my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] baby mode I want them to look like when you put a a potato chip bag in the microwave I fear women's clothing I fear it I fear it yeah I fear the delicate I like how sometimes they're through I also think it looks more beautiful on them and some me too I do love that I do that's my favorite part so I hate to see it on the ground seen dir so beautiful when it's on but sometimes you put in the dryer it blows up blows up blows up in a million pieces the the leggings go to Smither put the dryer I forgot about when the clo the clothes explode into Smither be fair I've never had leggings and washed them so I don't know how that works do you ever see those uh YouTube shorts of like uh it shows how many sheets something has and it falls like on a Minecraft character it's like a bed sheet and it has more polygons no I don't I'm not on a an algorithm that teaches me the world through Minecraft pH I am so it'll be like a cardboard brick and then it'll be like a four sectional piece and they'll just up the resolution that's crazy I say all this because I feel like some women's clothing are like the max resolution to in the folding room they have many it's so hard to fold it's so hard to fold you'll take a girl's like tank top out and I'm like like you just like do that it's like so gr dude baby teas I was like I I remember my ex-girlfriend I was like holding up a shirt I was like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is this you wear this do you have like a stuffed animal that wears this like how and she's like no it just like stretches they look different worn this in front of you and I'm like no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] way it was like this big and I don't like that you're so real for that cuz the women fool you with their clothes and so and every girl's got a sock drawer that's got a bunch of stuff in it what the I have a sock drawer with a bunch of stuff in it not just socks every woman loves sour candy yeah dude she did not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with sour Olympics s even a little bit well we didn't tell her about project sour project sour I have a feeling she also won't like that well that one has a visual aid we already have The Branding kind of sort of was going to take off sounded like she lowkey [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with Jay though yeah she [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with Jay ladies love Jay Jay's up well everyone does yeah he's hey do you think you're a magnetic guy me yeah to some degree I don't know Tina called me cool when she was drunk as piss that's what it took huh yeah she was like she again you're cool she was drunk as piss sounded like that that was that was honestly pretty spot on that's when she's not drunk she sounds like Teo she said I would never see to this to you sober so this is the only time you'll ever hear this I think you're cool I was like that's that's very not sweet of her not sweet I don't think so what it's very what do you mean it's very sweet because she's she's telling you there is no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] possible way in my right mind I'd ever think you were cool no no no she'd ever say I'm cool oh that's even worse cuz Shear yes damn but she's quietly admitting that she thinks you're cool all the time she's saying the little thing loud you know what I think lwi does well is that I think he brings he he becomes like the the the ring leader at parties so like everyone everyone you look over at lewick and he's got everyone playing like a game yeah yeah or something we've talked about this he gamifies parties he likes games but you know what's funny is he'll invent a game for everyone to play and then lose and get mad game no I do not do that I do not do that dude I've seen you scream when what game is lwi invting it's just like just have parties and stuff like well for instance like let's play cornhole right and we just get the cornhole out and you didn't really expect to come to Thanksgiving to play cornhole with Peter and Josh and then it just turns into the most competitive like sweat cornhole you've ever seen when Peter is like wandering around like a robot he's like I want to smoke a cigarette and L like has to take his shoulders and turn around Peter no dude and it just it turns into this like he it's just you're a competitive guy but I never got upset there because never lost but but he didn't but let me tell you when he was losing he was screaming at Peter dude it was crazy I was locked in I you know I did crazy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that day yeah you you turned up and I triple you do you do turn up at cornhole I turn up at cornhole oh not at not at uh the open SA or yeah Open sauce wait it was at Open sauce you crushed oh it was me and him that's right you got sunned and you got sunned I wasn't getting sunned I was turning up and then he would shut me down Oh I thought we were on a team me and you were on a team me and I never got paid out actually huh what was a pay out no I we paid it uh one I Ono for sure one of them was supposed to pay me oh he he paid you Aiden didn't pay me cuz he you owed him money I think I probably paid it yeah yeah which is annoying that sucks it's like he ow me yeah just pay out even if he you owe him it's not hard it's crazy that lwi said I didn't get paid but he's the one who got paid we just rewind on sometimes if you yell it you might get paid twice okay's no harm throw it out there throw it out there you might have been like oops sorry goat we should go to Vegas oh man do what I haven't been in a long time gamble with Drake and xqc we could you see you see Drake say that uh Steve Lacy's a fragile op yeah that is been I've been thinking about that ever since makes good songs if I called you a fragile op how would you feel there's a lot going on there that's awesome C he an artist Cody is not a glass C's a glass house Cody shouldn't throw stones best not to throw stones from a glass house Cody dude there was that when that beef was happening he's like had a show and Drake was like I don't care I got my back straight my head held high I got my friends and then someone posted he's like bro's manifesting yeah he's like how does he how does he tend to not look cool in so many situations like he's a fragile op and he's and he's streaming with XC that's where he says this and he goes X goes yeah okay so what's a fragile op can you explain that and he goes chat knows chat does not know chat has no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] idea that smooth answer also xcc with his bones like the unbreakable man like Samuel L Jackson in the movie if he moves one inch it's just it makes glass breaking sounds X did know nothing like he the weekend starts autop playing you see that too wait no what happened the weekend started autop playing and Drake's like we don't listen to that my God and like oh we don't listen to that okay no X would be like oh it's a playlist D the play I don't know dude he's going to be 30 one day that's funny X he's close he's like really close I know yeah you're going to be 30 you're going to be 30 you're going to be 30 I don't think I'll ever be 30 oh or you going to die I'm blow my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] brain yeah myself I'll take over clock stick what do you mean that that what that mean in what ways can you take over besides the ones that are weird no the weird ones yeah yeah yeah the weird no that's helpful we were saying we me and Nick were watching Freaky Friday uh the the dcom so so they so there's obviously lindzy loan one that came out in theaters whatever but there is a Disney Channel a musical that came out 2018 that's uh way like wor cuz it's just like a worse you know Lindsay in it Lindsay is not even mentioned they don't even say the word they didn't even say letters with l words with &amp;um but it's the same principle like they didn't mix it up or anything you know how sometimes newer Disney movies they'll be like oh now it's the son and a dad yeah yeah it's just also a mother and a daughter Friday's also a remake right uh yeah yeah it's oh it is it is yeah yeah it got me thinking who like of all of us who would you want Freaky Friday into your life like I I can only pick everyone in this room yeah and you have to Freaky Friday for like the rest of your life oh yeah like it's that's why it's hard and it's it's forever rest of your life unless you find like the magical way to like solve all of our problems right isn't that just like like friendship or some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] no like communication don't wait they kiss fall on the mouth at the end of it and then they kiss yeah the mom and the daughter have an open mouth kiss Aiden they don't openmouth kiss I think they do no that's J Lee I vely remember this they like remember that yeah and they started fingering okay that's so cra it's weird I thought so too never I never enjoyed J Curtis is 11 in the movie She's she has the mind of an 11year old it's like the reverse anime argument uh I would I would it's not you and and that's why why is it it's why is it it's alive dude a little mean cuz you don't want wa is it more that you don't want him to have your life or is that you his life I I don't think I could live like you what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] wait wait hold on let me understand this you could still live you live like him that in my mind that's what I'm doing the experiment of no you you you are switched into my body and my life but then you take control but you're still blood so really it would be like an exercise of like oh I can could go out and be lwig and have a bunch of emotional conversations but but does does the body hold any of what the old person used to do like what I want to sleep on the floor I think so in in the freaky Frid yeah in the Freaky Friday remake uh there there is a point where the the mom switches into the teenager's body and now now she's in class and then she starts getting flustered over the boy she likes which is very strange cuz the Mom starts getting the hots for a high schooler because her biology can't help it and then they go into a song about how biology can't be helped and mom's kind of looking at the kid like wait wait wait wait wait wait I'm sorry I'm serious the Disney movie that's yes in in Biology class that's like the bit oh age chest a number you can't dude honestly because we were watching we were like that's a that's a minor brother yeah brother I don't know but so so basically wow which which there also there was also a point where someone like threw a ball at her head while she the mother's in the kid's body and she goes like like Spider-Man catches it and she's like whoo my crazy reflexes so you like you know so yeah so I would retain some of your physicality you be good at Tom kench you have his Greek jeans to get to get big I'd have a a nasty Tom kench my shoulder be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I would say my shoulder's just put out I would say it's your brains are full swap but like your chemical your chemical imbalances stay yeah so I then I yeah that's why I say no to slime so why your chemical makeup what's wrong with my chemicals for you you're the most imbalanced you're the mo yeah you're the most the most balanced if you're looking for balance yes so you oh you want to switch into Mario's Body the Mario of the show want to switch into the Mario the Mind Mario it's like The Ill Mind of Mario The Ill Mind of Mario the Spanish version I'm zenis if I'm going to take over someone's body I want a good vessel yeah anom was a great vessel and and he's closer to anom all right you're not the best Nick he's not a bad vessel either you saying I just a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] vessel you're the worst vessel here of of the world you're probably like a top [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 20% 20 top that's so many people including babies yeah yeah like I think no wait but swapping with a baby be tight you just start over that that' be a that' be a fresh respa depends you're kind of being a baby with an adult M you're lock in baby hell for a while yeah dud your ass wiped that's awesome but I I think you would revert a lot of your knowledge also you're you're just like a helpless kid for a lot of time yeah a lot of your brain would atropy I don't know how helpless you I think you're just physically cuz you're you're mental there you know everything you know the thing is you have to imagine a child with the adult brain living with parents you'd be the greatest player in the world at your age no no matter not even for that long if you're two no cuz then you don't have neuroplasticity brother no but he does because he's in the child's brain oh do I I couldn't lose a single two-year-old on the planet yeah that's true a four-year-old I start losing quickly start losing your Edge you start losing so quickly and it's almost worse to be like The Prodigy who's great at two and then fed off you just quit like Baby Tarzan yeah skateboard now not even at strong or young Hulk or baby CR the same guy I probably there's so many strong boys that we all know of in media yeah there are you know I mean it's something that we we've always look to yeah we Bo we should make sour boy [Music] just rub a kid in put it in your mouth no no no that's horrible can we can we we can just we do that Sour Patch Kids we do we pump those kids the sour they beat us a sour boy they did they did Sour Patch Kids oh also sour boys S boys what is this this is made by oompaville wait why does this look so similar to sour man wasn't some of these because it's a parallel thinking we have some of these downstairs yeah we have some of this this made by a YouTuber whoa oh sour YouTuber you what do you still need those for a video no I use it do you eat them youa you like them they're good they're good you like the sour boys I've been chopping oh okay he likes some Sour Aiden eat some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's not his they've been sting out for months leave it to a to feast and then someone drinks his protein drink he's like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] little monster it's like getting your tea drink somebody takes my P shake and then they don't replace it no look we must we must replenish are one guy from Australia who works out here every day we can say it miles is extremely Shameless and and it's hard to make him feel shame yeah and he drinks it and he's like oh true and it's like miles learn the lesson don't drink it anymore he's like oh yeah okay and then he just does it again and it's like it's a great miles it's like a Dopey a little D made a little too dump tell that's how it is cuz dude sometimes he'll just stare off this is this is this is what miles does this funny thing where he'll laughing he'll drink the protein shake and then he'll say he'll replace it he won't replace it for a while maybe a week week and a half later he'll replace it and he'll do something nice he'll put two in there he's like I've doubled up I've GI I've given him two this is a slime method but then he comes back 2 days later and then he drinks those protein shakes and then and then you never got to drink the replac well they were they were on cool down the thing is you you had an opportunity I had the time your it's just about making the best of that opportunity Nick don't pull take your hood off and pull your pull your sweater down I know you're wondering why is Nick

you get to spend that many less minutes obligated such a oh it's pett such a no I wasn't going to say that so your great view of the world Aiden did you we had a dead rat outside did you get it all of them yeah dude oh no we had another one kudos to Aiden cuz I didn't want to do it Aiden's the red there's been okay you're Charlie it's because there's seven cats that live outside I I'm I am the Rat King right now I have a question for you guys cuz you you saw that rat have you seen the others no okay I I hate to go superstitious mode there has been three dead rats in the same spot outside the door of the office dude dude the kitties are bringing them to us why are they always right there why are they always the door it's not even in a different part of the parking lot they are always like 10 ft in front of the door and the trash can zipper can you look up uh this like the super sious meaning of a cat killing a mouse guys I can tell you no I want kind of want like AI Google to Telly this is just this is just Why kill I've been watching The Sopranos man this is very similar yes I have you have aome me too yes I have a great show the next sentence is going to hurt you exclusively on YouTube shorts that doesn't hurt me by the way hurts most people who like good things what a sign of good luck oh that's when a cat brings it that's protection from yeah that's that's being protected by the neighborhood cat they're not just dropping dead right there I'm saying this is not a cat this is a human who's killing rats putting them in front because Aiden's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rat snake maybe the rats are going through the Bermuda Triangle and it's right there what if the Bermuda Triangle is here it's a portal that drops these theories are better than the cat Theory That's crazy cuz there's a lot of cute ass cats who how do you clean up the dead rats uh I grab a plastic bag or how many how many just one huh just one just one I'd be grabbing two you know what I mean yeah 100% i' be grabbing two I I would do one but I wouldn't touch it I would like like really try to press it firmly on the ground and then scoop it without having cuz I don't want to feel its organ yeah yeah yeah I was surprised at the lack of ants the bag that's ant don't like that no ants love blood what yeah you would think that all sorts of Critters and bugs would want to eat all the awesome R they do they do love the rat ant like berries I had that bloody nose and it's like hella uh toilet paper ants were coming out like I had crazy like blood in and I like it got all over with the toilet paper and it was like clotted and I threw it in the trash right the ants found it they started eating the blood off of the toilet paper damn they love blood that's gross anyway my technique is uh I grab a plastic you know piece of plastic for a packaging or a bag and then I pick it up by its tail and then I I was wondering yeah what if what if it the body disconnected from the tail like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lizard to happen it'd be traumatizing oh my God I feel imagine the poor poke Man Fan who after the pokem Man episode said these guys are kind of funny I love some boor here the thing they're not scared of that uh I'm just saying this episode and perhaps might might be uh kind of gross we are dressed in the same out I'm sorry I said fingering thank you f I should apologize Jesus Christ I think I think embarass three rats it's been three rats outside this office sacrificed apparently I think the next one's an employee Nick Yingling eviscerated on the sidewalk on the ground what it should be is a thumb or like a finger of some sort so that's that's how it escalates dude the dead rat was so sad maybe he was sleeping Aiden why do the cats not finish the food cats killed for game that's why they outdoor cats are uh like bad for ecosystems oh For the Love of the Game yeah they don't kill for they don't kill for yum yums they kill there's enough rats to go around wait they kill cats are really bad outdo cats are really bad for ecosystems cuz they kill indiscriminately and they kill like birds they'll kill different dude if you're a bird and you get killed by a cat you should have killed yourself that's on you that's crazy I understand you have some very classic Americana logic here but just this is studied how is a how is a bird being captured by a house cat they can [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fly they can fly that's crazy to me birds get captured by house cats yeah yeah so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Bravo that's a gold medal but also here's the thing too rats are really important for ecosystems no they're not what do they do they eat all our cheese they they eat they eat a lot of stuff that you don't like when it when it's they play Little Guitars like old pizzas old pizzas they eat the old pizzas for us making up [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this is out cats look short you saw you saw on surprise yeah grifter C Maya we call her and what's she going to know [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] woman hand I don't even know if she's heard of rats you don't think she's heard of what a rat is nope that's you should ask her first have you heard of a rat Maya I'm on the yard podcast and I am in a 1v3 and I'm hoping you'll back me up I'm not against you all right probably won't okay uh she's heard of rats have you heard of what rats are what a rat is yeah yeah okay I'm surprised that's a good start uh second one this is the real one uh outdoor cats good or bad so bad why why they just kill the rats and rats suck no they're like big time invasive species in so many places they kill like between one and two billion Birds a year really bad explain what I said the argument they brought up to me that I didn't know how to defend was say how I said it the why why is the bird losing to the cat that can just fly away um yeah yeah that's what I thought well I I don't know I mean they're just not good at it there was a bird in New Zealand it was a flightless Ren and it went extinct in like two years because of a cat that they brought to the island one cat he was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] his name was tibbles or her name was tibbles and she had babies and there were a bunch of cats and then the bird was extinct wow do you naturally not like cats cuz you're like a bird person no I love cats that's complex is is there an animal you hate no okay well then what if it was a racist animal yeah what if it was a racist animal we're past the question now guys no not really would you hate a racist animal are rats racist I don't don't think they can be wow what if I made one what if I gave it cheese every time I looked at a white person all right thank you very much appr bad thank you appr may thanks mayae by May well four correspondent she actually a dead ass she didn't help your argument did I'm not convinced kill a billion Birds those birds deserve it so I'm sorry I think natural selection future bird will be better the world's worst non-native invasive species I'm sorry don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] read a Google AI thing that Maya just said like it's news you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] oh my God wait no the AI is telling this is big we got to do something a big deal you're so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I I don't know maybe cats aren't the way do you think that it's okay when species go extinct is the question how's the rat racist I'm not an ecologist it depends because of um Thurman um Thurman because they just do are cat you cat or dog person can't say both uhoh why because why is it a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dichotomy because it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is you can't vote for you can't vote for Trump at the same time both huh you can vote for bothy cuz some of us like ass but some of us like titties though oh man that still defends me another falsey but one got to go one's got to go got to go we know what you're picking I'm not picking a tiess or assless person oh you superficial [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you're disgusting I wouldn't pick either oh yes you would yeah you would I'd pick her for her beautiful mind that's what I'm saying and everything she knows about math uh books cat cat person wow you dog you're a dog for that but you're dude your parents dog is so cute I love that dog see can I have it no me and Peter will talk you won't I bet I could buy it from Peter for 100 grand Jeff definitely not why I promise cuz Peter loves his animal no I don't think so what what if though he wouldn't do it Miss buying your childhood dog from your dad to flex on you that's sick not it's not my childhood imagine like Logan Paul off with your your parents like a million dollars for the just to MOG you I have your childhood dog I I think 10 mil my mom says no come on yeah 10 mil you got say yeah to that one that's principled she liked that okay you know what I think Ludwick thinks a lot in terms and I I don't blame him of like what the public perception of if this thing happened right so if he sold CS to Logan Paul for $100 million y he wouldn't do that Prime cuz the cuz the headline says lwig MOG sells C I think I think you're thinking too deep yeah I'm just saying I wouldn't do it cuz I love Coots and 100 million wouldn't change my life 100 million wouldn't change 100 million would change your life just lying you're lying to people I don't it change [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it would change your life I would still be playing about five hours of League where I can a day it wouldn't change it and it would be responsible because you wouldn't have to do anything for the next 10 Generations that's true that's true uh no it wouldn't yeah you would 100 million you sell CS I'm a dog person I do not sell CS I would just get him another you don't you don't understand no cuz you an ant a Cheerio you just you don't understand pets yeah I do I love pets no you don't I'm just saying if if you're if you're boing at someone refusing to take money for a pet you don't understand pets you just can't say publicly that you'd sell CS for 100 Mil I I'm saying on my mama's life I wouldn't sell CS for 100 Mil I believe him I don't I believe that's a bad decision on their mama's life you think it's worth 100 why Hat [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] godamn [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] at all he's not part of this also he left his mom's in the hood we should smoke this Ute we should smoke this you you left your moms's in the hood you don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do that I absolutely someone ought to smoke this you in a great neighborhood that neighborhood bro there's rats everywhere there's rats everywhere donated there RS everywhere damn here well ours are donated by the spirits hey petless petless petless y'all couldn't handle a pet petless but I pet it yuck just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yuck and after what you said about Jamie Lee Curtis that's crazy why am I the enemy what you said was young but what you it was also yuck you get to say yuck you know I just wanted to say the word fingering it's funny to me tired of as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] y'all y'all actually could handle a pet I believe that you don't think we obviously handle AET no you couldn't you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] couldn't for sure end up loving it and like my life is different all right guys we all go home with an egg what is handling a pet me we see who comes back with the egg like taking care of it loving it protecting it for the entire tenure of its life dud people with opio addictions take care of their pets yeah they love their pets they're better pet owners than you'd be well okay Aiden is an outlier because out hat the second he'd have to pick up poop he'd put a 44 Magnum in his dog's mouth yeah I I kill it he like actually the dog Li up the rats that is a really good argument it is really he does it he does it cuz it's stank rats well for us we think about the rat's life and how sad that is and we don't want to touch it he is just like oh thank God it's dead I I get to throw it away you like itate the Earth of it so he's doing such a nice thing for everyone here he such a sick interpretation also Yingling should be taking care of the rats that's just the hierarchy yeah that's just the hierarchy that's so sick too yeah cuz I think engling would take a bite he well gets a bite like a factor meal I I'm back on your side I was against you but I now think you could take care of a pet there's enemies all around me I'm I'm forced to do this because they've gone farther than I wanted them to you guys got destroyed on the dog thing too we didn't get destroyed we have to admit it the referendum was heavily part of the dog thing is everyone on his side was like oh God you're in a coffee shop and a loud dog is just barking and it's like why is the dog loud yeah in their minds the dogs were evil dogs are always evil why why is the dog loud I see a dog I see a dog almost every day in everyone thinks a poorly trained dog is annoying bro the argument is that they're not all poorly trained you can't leave your well- trained dog at home for 2 hours an hour people use the same argument for Italian immigrants mhm and they lay eggs yeah so and do you know Christopher Columbus Day is actually Italian Heritage day yep so and also he was he was on the Spectrum so he didn't know what he was doing Christopher Columbus was neuro diverent and a minor think about that so next time you want to take his day away [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dude uh yeah we lost in the dog thing and I think I have been La pilled I yeah it is an LA thing it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] not cuz I've gone to coffee shops around the world the the only reason I say this is cu the movie theater Park the movie theater part there are way way more dogs in the South they take their dog around in a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] truck bed yeah and it's called Cletus and it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rolls coal [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] here's the thing about dogs though they're not an evasive speeches speechy speeches spe I'm Bilal not invasive species no Ken was telling us the other day uh he has a friend he's like uh who he used to work with he's like dude the the hardest roast I've ever heard it's like he's not uh he doesn't have a first language he has two second languages because he sucks at both wait who I can't say oh okay not me though no he instantly thought it was him you just you just say ether e that's how it's supposed to be said you see [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] oh imagine bro it wasn't even close but imagine you made it hard to imagine you think you would shoot something and make it sometime sometimes in beer pong I show up Is that real I do a sober celeb shot I did one that brought the house down one time at Rad's house at Rad's house it was recent that was

comparison she said without his glasses on she looks like that side character in Star Wars the the little orange Lady of Star Wars oh yeah and it was one to one yeah that guy gets mileage too yeah and the comparison World ugly aliens tend to be funny to compare humans to I guess it's true yeah cuz it doesn't hurt the alien no cuz they hurts the they're not real I think I'm the white Clint Stevens

I got something in my throat from Dam LS would you suck a man's penis to save cs's life yes yeah wait am I part of it it's his it's his penis he would yeah well has Nick blow blow dry his hair would you suck a b penis every day for CS to live every single the day you stop C stop CS dies actually no better question if would okay okay so you got to suck a man's penis first we're just going to get that out of the way it's not part of is this you got to do it this is the Nick Fuentes Twitter thing oh yeah that would you would you suck off every W it's Matt Walsh like I would kill every animal to save one human life and they're like would you suck all the animals penises save one human and I don't think he answered he did not answer oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's just shocking how little he cares about human life every a penis is presented to you once a day like in a Bento bar and it can be it can actually be the penis of your choice or your dreams it could be with the one you've dreamed it could be the one that you've dreamed of okay all right for every day you do not suck it to completion a day is removed from C's life W okay so so C is not just die dude he's Min maxing so how often if ever are you sucking that John so basically every day I don't suck is two days she has lived instead of one so this is effectively having her lifespan if I never suck a dick yes do I know how long she's going to live no no yeah that makes it tough yeah cuz there are there are weeks where no sucking will happen and there are weeks where extraordinary amounts of sucking will happen cuz he can get it in yeah he can get it got the you can get it it what the he's just feel it no he can pencil in the suck can I do multiple a day can I stack him you could stack 100% bro let him St it depends what the refract period is you have to wait for cool down you can't just well I thought said could be any person no but you can't well you pick your your guy get 10 [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] guys there you want 10 gu oh sure [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it whatever you 10 guys a roster you get you get the bull P what I'm saying what I'm saying is you can't go for a strat where he busts an awesome load in your mouth and then and then and then when he's not capable of doing it again you get another one and you can't sneak one with the dry it's it's like it's like uh it's like resetting your Auto and Le I think you brought it up I I really didn't I think you okay fine what do you want to talk about okay all right do you want talk about the smell of flowers I've been thinking about that a lot recently thinking about lately smells good I like the flowers I just feel like you should answer the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] question Life Alive oh you're on that too your baby cat that you love okay is there a so will she die of natural causes regardless she'll she'll die whatever the way she's destined to die is but I'm saying if I I suck a million penises in one day she's immortal okay so there you go oh so you can add on you can add you can go over the limit forever you can break damage limit here so let's say C is gonna live another 300 days so here's the answer I don't I don't suck a single penis why the day I see her looking ill you suck all the penis I suck all the penis you start sucking as much dude sucking for the Cure yeah the Race for the Cure I suck for the cause for the kid and and then she's Immortal and then I never have to suck again dude and it's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up like pee hub live stream were you just sucking why is it a live stream what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] because you might as well it why not you're loving this is this is this would all be under wraps really it all be under wraps yeah yeah he still wants brand deals we the minute he does porn a lot of those get pulled under the road you would we wouldn't be able to work with you don't think Red Bull still get behind you name sponsor specifically probably in this instance but yeah that happened with amaran they were like like what was that that b day company that that was going to and then they thought she was like a porn star yeah and then they were like you know what this isn't really tushy value your product is the name of an ass yeah porn isn't as crass as as putting stuff in your butt like a b does there's a v is also porn it's cleaning your ass cleaning your ass isn't porn it's learning it can be it's learning it's every every day if you want it to be poop out of your ass is more gross than porn yeah that's fair well it depends you walk in a Time Square LED giant screen people [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you looking at somebody's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with poop on it which would you rather see he he visibly real fact it's so crass I mean the answer is obvious it's a real gay sonth thought daughter situation it's if anything we you should be losing sponsors because of your support for bedet really yeah well no cuz he's trying live stream the Beday it's the difference between Beday and porn porn is publicized the first sour B you know what's not banned Aiden is sex sex you can have sex and still have sponsors wants to ban it w wants to ban sex they're getting gav think Gavin Nome dropped a new Bill said no more sex we sorry no more heteros sex keep the slavery in California prisons and ban the sex that's what Gavin Nome said that was a crazy thing to vote on dude I know I keep thinking about I was having read it a few times I was having a conversation with just the because everything has that detailed forign against like these organizations for these organizations against and so you get a detailed idea of who's supporting what and then slavery just had no one no one was against it no no one was against getting rid of it and then we still voted no I think it's cuz it sounded from a common sense point of view that some people are just like well they're in prison they should be working yeah think that's I think that is unfortunately the average person's Outlook they might not understand like okay who is in prison who are the people working and like what is the type of Labor they have to do and like how little are they earning CU like it's is it literal zero uh I think it's either it depends where you are I think it ranges from like Far Far Below minimum wage to to nothing D my dad said when he was in jail he they made him fight fires like they sent him on like the front lines of like to fight brush fires yeah he's like yeah [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he's like yeah I got a lot of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in my in my lungs cuz of the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we had to use and I'm like that's crazy it's more and more common now too cuz the wildfires are getting bigger and there's more and more to deal with every year so there more and more inmates have to do that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they dispatch inmate firefighters I read some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] online that I believed immediately without any research that Australia gave us a bunch of trees and that they lighted on fire really easily dude the L con you hear about this no is it fake I don't know I believe believe it blindly we should ask J think gave us weak trees they gave us like a specific type of tree and we planted millions of them and they were like hey by the way they're really flammable we gave them I show speed and they give us flammable trees in forest fire country thanks for nothing thanks for nothing dude do you see he's going to do like a 30-day live stream tour of Africa no oh my God that's kind of sick it's gonna be hype he's dude he's G to it reminds me of wild boys did you guys ever see that after jackass it was Chris ponus and steo and they would just go across the world [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with animals but like getting bitten by cool animals yeah and and I'm like these guys are just living their dream they're just doing drugs hanging out in nature and traveling the world mhm that's great and speed's doing that kind of the same without probably drug animals are the drugs I dude if you can speed a bullet ant glove like in uh can you look that up zipper I think we watched it before um but Chris ponti has puts on a thing with bu I've seen I remember this yeah he just starts he just starts saying no no like he wants it to stop and you it's hard to get him to say that yeah and that was party boy uh yeah it's wild boys bullet ants or something like that D I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hate whenever ants can hurt you I'm like why what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] be regular ants we got rid of the hurt like fire ants they got to defend themselves no they don't from what me yeah yeah and different Predators hous did you guys ever do the magnifying glass thing yes yeah yeah was hype I heard about it was less about killing ants and it was more like I can burn stuff with this thing yeah I was more in that camp burn anything you know and then I didn't commit a crime afterwards yeah I didn't kill a human being with and feel their flesh and feel how awesome it was after that with a magnifying I if you look at my record I have no fire related crun related crated usually don't say it but okay it's good to say it we can say it all right now we could all say it we go around and I I not committed mhm okay cool we all said it that's good cuz we all don't have one right CU I don't have yeah okay yeah cuz then the you you try it on anything and then you like burn holes and leaves I would go my I remember going in my backyard and just like there was a there was a bunch of a small garden and it was had surrounded by wood and I would just try to light the wood on fire in like different angles and stuff and see how fast I could do it by like changing the angle of the Imagine they were dogs yeah yeah and imagine I didn't think I could get it to work I think we had a bad magnifying glass Ora was stupid you need a big one probably I saw a guy on YouTube you saw a guy on YouTube shorts dude what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is going on got a really big modifying class how big is it really big really big like it burns metal W like from the Sun and it's all it burns metal so this yeah can we get one of those machines that cuts stuff with just water like a water jet those are cool cuz water shouldn't be able to do that I want to put Nick jingling in and count his Rings Jesus Christ they're just they're just different Factor labels is that don't park do Park I found out that LOD is an orthopedic surgeon oh really and he was describing how like in or in orthopedic surgery cuz he's in residency right now the two the two paths you can go like joints and and stuff like that um he can he he has like two paths ahead of him where he can have like a pretty pretty stable easy schedule where if he goes and just works on people's joints and like helps them with like knee surgeries and you have a fixed like schedule right or he said way more cool and fun is like someone gets their finger detached and he reattaches the finger yeah right and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that he's like but your schedule's crazy because it's like you're just on call for when that happens fast possible exactly so we get the water jet cut nicking Yingling's finger off and we know a doctor who can fix which route's he going so no one he isn't sure yet he's un locked in we could do Yingling could be his practice girl but he knows how to do both do you get paid more for the other I assume uh I didn't ask him if you're on call you still make a salary right there's no way you're making commission commission no cuz then conflict of interest you're going around cutting we hired you all these guys started coming in with no fingers yeah you're like that's crazy that's so weird how much a damn doctor makes uh it depends what you do it while it varies heavily I think if you're like an anesthesiologist somewhere between like people on fear and and people in the yard you know what I mean somewhere right in the middle that's sad if you're working like if you're like a general practitioner you know you're doing Family Medicine you're making like 300K really yeah off rip that's on the low end off rip off doctors make a lot of money but it's after after you know after you live in residency poverty for a few years work 24hour shifts and residency like minimum wage or some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] residency I mean technically less some some doctors make like 6 if you map it out residency is pretty bad you think anyone like you know they used to say like anesthesiologist make like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ton of money they do they make like 800k to like a million a year wait what I thought it was lower you know when you say we make more than doctors we don't make more than those doctors that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy cuz they're not doctors though they they all they do is put on the Mas they are they're doctors I thought that it was like a certification I they're all doctors and then that's like the specialty that they have Oh I thought it was like a two-year thing it's so much longer low key seems like the easiest one low key like obviously if you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up it is bad the stakes are high but like your actual job is just like the scheduling the scheduling for anesthesiologist is apparently pretty chill and you're also just D you're just playing with dials it's the road to get there that is very very hard what's the most evil doctor I think it's real real real cuz he why cuz all he wanted to do was look at titties and vaginas all day I I you know what I talk I talked to Z 3 about this and I was she was talking about how like you know not wanting a male gynecologist which is very understandable and I was like and she was like I just don't trust why would any man like want to become a gynecologist and I was like I am sure there's some like good reasons and then I looked this up I like went on Reddit and I found like some Reddit threads asking you know doctors in male gynecologist pretty much the unified answer across this is uh men who because gynecologists deliver babies and they're like people who guys who think just like helping people with the process of birth and delivering children is like a miracle and working in in this space is like really really interesting and they they really appreciate that part about it and then the other thing was uh a bunch of people who there's like huge parts of the world where like Gynecology care is like really really poor and a lot of like women die in childbirth or they don't have like the feminine H hygiene products that they need and uh to help with you know to help people in like foreign countries deal with this like huge gap in Women's Healthcare they saw a need and they were like I would really like to do that type of work that's why they got into it so you think they're all heroes I think every male gynecologist is a hero and any woman who had a bad experience with one is making it up I think every and that's and that's really the point I was trying to get to slimes thank you for I imagine every male gynecologist who posted why they became a male gynecologist on Reddit they're going to be like no they're answering question somebody asking this question and people I think anyone's going out there being like I want to the what about what about the gy aist what about him what do they do where is he at uh he well he's everywhere he's in our hearts for he's like Santa Claus Santa Claus we have a guy colist in all of us I like to think so what about the butt doctor what did he want to do Aiden there's no birthing happening there he just wants to be in your butt I don't I don't know if there is a butt doctor Pro are you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kidding me you heard of you have a doctor friend this is crazy I mean I've heard of proctology but isn't like isn't my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] uh my primary care doctor doing my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but don't do that anymore there's a difference between someone who sometimes is in your butt and someone who said I want to be in your butt who wants to live in your butt I tried to get that they don't do it anymore I asked zipper's like yep zipper is a butt by the way if you guys didn't know yeah uh no I think another another like because I've looked into the Sue and the butt doctor part not the Gynecology part but I'm sure there's some overlap is like sometimes you just feel the the need that like oh we have a opening for this opening for this position that position this is also the common answer I've seen across like different different professions of medicine is it like it just happens to be the fellowship that you can like get a spot in yeah I don't think you always get the pick but that is to say if a if a woman is like I don't really want to mist it's totally fine yeah [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happens huh you know [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happens [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happens [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happens I got to look at titties all day I I'm always the butt of the joke there was a at at our house there was girls giving last night G giving G giving G giving invited think we going take me on life and I'm think we want a place Jama you haven't seen that Meme wor about it think we G stuffing we can't believe I wasn't invited yeah I got I got I came in and they all were like boo yeah I was like ladies ladies please I did not get that reception I'm on my way to mid lane me they didn't cheer oh there was so many women in our house there was a lot of women in our house it was it was like 25 women that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy and I went you know I just went to my room for a bit and then and then I come out I'm going to grab something to eat cuz it was offered and then I go to sit down on the couch and cutie sitting there zipper 3 sitting there uh two of zipper 2's friends and they're all talking and I'm not it's it's so funny cuz we we basically just make this joke all the time I sit down and they're just talking about Gynecology appointment like they're just and what you think girls are always talking about and cuti is like yeah and then the last time I went in it was actually like pretty nice cuz he had like a headlamp on and then and I was like what and then I I was like I'm sorry to interrupt this conversation but I feel like you know I haven't been to a lot of Gynecology appointments but if the guy had a headlamp on it would it would be throwing me off no cuz otherwise how do you think they see by all the lights and then they all in unison and all in unison is like no it's so much better than the overhead light cuz you know girls hate the white overhead lighting homophobic lighting fluorescent lighting and then it's and everything's just exposed but the headlamps more respectful right and also nothing nothing like the the gynecologist about to go spelunking in you're thinking of like as like a cartoonish character with like a headlamp like let see what's going on in this cage he's gotting that's how you view it I mean I think the more the more gizmos and gear you have the more there is a separation of like this is a clinical procedure and he he has the tools for my vagina the job so you want him to have less gizmos no I think it's good for them to have gizmos the more gizmos the better yeah cuz ites more professional makes it more professional gynecologist with more me that guy of college just holding like a hammer it's like H oh interesting now I kind of want to go to a butt appointment Proctologist yeah what do you you we talked about it now you want specialist I don't think I'm curious but I don't think it's like a general like hey let's check out I'm sure if I I don't think it's like I don't think it's like for you type [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you know what I mean you know they I don't think it's gay keeping they wouldn't check out my butt you you ain't hungry like that like that no my butt would get there no you ain't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that you know what I mean like like my guy sees real [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like you you like that take big [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] not and then and Rain Bolt's like never gatekeep Proctologist again this is where he is the camera like like a geog Guster camera comes out of Aiden's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up to the office dude he was supposed to be here today like here where rainbolt like here in la oh yeah not for the yard but just in La for this thing I'm doing with KY lator and he couldn't come cuz his passport was full he went to the airport and they couldn't let him leave CU they couldn't stamp his passport cuz it was full Is that real I didn't know you could do that he maxed it out I don't understand he maxed out the passport was full no I get that but why would that matter if he's coming to the US uh cuz I don't think he'd be able to come back be able to get back in yes that's cool it's his he maxed out the Toyota so does filling your passport out expire it to go get a new one you can usually go to like the consulate and add pages how they add pages to that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they just literally stable pages in oh but you can't do it in Thailand specifically that's what uh speed's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] looks like I bet too his shit's probably crazy yeah and it's you know what's cool is they don't care how famous you are you got to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] go through the process that's dope that's kind of grounding what if you're what if you're Obama Obama's different he moves different think he has how famous you are I think Obama has enough motion to get through motion motion I think he just takes Air Force One right not any what do they what does a retired buddy do they get Air Force two sweetheart buddy Air Force he's not the president who is who is the Pres Delta should serve lunch Ley on the plane you Delta serving Shake Shack now yeah that's real I didn't mean I don't think it's Delta I might have to fly Delta can't be I don't think it's Delta wait yeah it is I don't think it is look it up no what does it matter oh what do you think it is why don't you take your guys Zipp what does it matter Hawaiian I know now I know he's just not even serious I don't think it's Del being serious all right zipper drum roll they're not even their own [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] anymore man Alaska bought them oh my God bro don't worry about it I think Alaska Airlines is the best cuz they let that guy steal the plane zipper what airline is selling is making Shake Shack their food I still think about that guy yeah that guy is that guy the the the recording of that guy stealing the Alaska Airlines plane and they're trying to get him to come down and he's just like no man like it's just nice up here and and he just and he just talks for a couple hours before he like it's just his last ride the answer's Delta by the way hey we're listening why did you car so much I don't think it's Delta Del you're better than this I don't think it's that I want some I want they made Shake Shack has those parmesan fries now oh no they're truffle fries truffle parmesan they are and they're awesome and it comes with like a truffle sauce I wanted to become a Smash Burger guy get a Smash Burger face what isers are No Joke Man start grilling them up I don't think I've ever been there I start making them myself see you smash the burger I smash a damn burger then the edges are all crispier I worked at a joint for 4 hours the you worked at a Smash Burger for 4 hours yeah why did you leave I was done with my shift and then you quiet never you never came back like four months ago oh my god dude I got quiet fired once what yeah you just get taken off schedule they stop scheduling yeah that's clean that's a clean way to do it that's a bad way to do it it's clean because if you're in that spot typically aren't getting a lot of ships in the first place yeah I was already getting like only one to two ships a week yeah and then they just take your ass off like have some balls that's what I'm saying I I was totally cool with it I was like you're right I suck I just think at oh yeah I mean it is usually what's the but like that that's worth telling the person what's the worst you guys ever were at a job like what what was your worst era of employment definitely this one where I was making pizza at a sports bar and then I got fired you just didn't have what fired from two jobs actually cuz your pizzas were [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cuz he was born no he was born to make coffee my pizzas were the best in the restaurant don't jump up were the best in the restaurant I don't believe that fire the best pizza maker he was the he was one of the best you don't think they would had a conversation like really really you fired the best pizza maker to call him Golden Pizza verilla that pizza that place stopped being my pizza a long time ago what it become about [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] politics yeah and you couldn't you didn't stand for that no I thought look when I was there there [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I was making I was making bread stick Pizza were you accidentally pouring ODS what' you do uh no I was just 16 what does that mean that that's I was a 16y old specific I didn't like want a job so I sucked at it I just like was like I don't want to clean the tables I don't you know I just do everything really slowly you know when like you're moving slow cuz you want your SHP to be over oh that's what lwig does yeah yeah when uh you you do a job poorly in hopes you won't be asked again give me an example because this is is slander on my name you think it's slander I actually can't think of of an example sler on my name my name this is back before you lived with us bro yes I've been incompetent but never willingly I don't think lwig does that but I do think lwig says he doesn't like an idea before he's even thought about the idea he doesn't he doesn't want to do the work the idea would bring but then he has to backtrack the reasoning as why it's a bad idea CU he's already so busy so he says like no it's not a good idea yeah and then later he comes up with the idea on his own what what is an example of this uh NDA the first example that I'm thinking of right now I can't talk about uh think about how many ideas think about how many ideas lwig that you said I said yeah I told you to do that like all right well me and kette are doing free parking in La later today that would go that would go you only people have stolen that idea since then I get sent Tik toks all the time the idea is like what they put [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] eight coins in a meter call a day oh dude if that's the if it's a YouTube short send it to his if that's a Kai stream I might be watching yeah bro and and also every other parking spot a Lamborghini let's go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you are you doing that kind thing today yeah holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and you can get a Lamborghini in our patreon uh uh
