getting canel yes dude let him experience something the cancellation is actually like slime on 10 different TR friends coded accounts just like he Aiden is so well spoken and well worded that it really shows that you can't win because I would just see what he says I'm like wow that is a really way phrase that I'm sure he spent like he's already getting on calls with people in the replies he does he will get on a call with you if you're mad enough at him which is very respectable honestly that happened to me when like Minecraft stands would get mad at me like at one point I was like okay

were it was everywhere yeah you couldn't breathe without it being around you yeah what was it like being being a Minecraft person and having that sort of Swarm at your beck and call like a like a I got all the negatives and none of the positives because my viewers were you know my age or adults and like they like my humor and then like I was just loosely associated with the Minecraft people so like I would get like the negative connotation of oh you have the a Minecraft audience but none of them watch me what was your trajectory as a Creator what was like the beginning to then like how did

dude and I ran into sceners at the DMV [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like like the last day that like I lived in Austin like we were like we joked when we moved there it was like What if we see Cen nners at one point like no it won't happen literally the last day I'm living in Austin we're just at the DMV's there the government you get picture with them no I you did you say hi yeah you went to the DMV with a friend yeah I've never done that I remember to the well maybe off think I was changing aess or something I was putting in like my it was something like that yeah he's a man yeah to the D why would you be changing sorry go ahead why would I be changing my state you said a dress it was a pun but there's no way to link into it it was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stupid I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stupid for thinking about it I get what he's going for you're not stupid as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you're not a dumb [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] P of sh ask you a question lwig why did you not catch that ball dude cuz you right next to it that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] was inches away you jum for it I was watching on TV like I saw Stan was there and I saw New Year's your if you put your all into a jump would you be high enough um I don't think so unless so okay we we it was Stan's cat died Wait Wait Don't Laugh say it again what the hell say again dude you are using this as an excuse for something that you failed at doing that is why I'm laughing I am not doing that then why okay did you say cat died that's how he started the story he why are you do you want to join in un this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's obviously not funny that happened right there why okay sorry go ahead finish the St explain how it's relevant say it again start it from the beginning and and I don't you don't laugh this time I won't I met him unexpectedly wow no this is really mean well I hope it's un expectedly I Pro yeah well so you took him to the Dodgers game so I we surprised him by taking him to the Dodgers game it was it was me Stans relle Atari you didn't you could have just said that we went to the I get it goed you wanted virtue signal points I get it wow I'm just letting you know the content fail yeah hell yeah M man's go let's go dude all right well okay and and so I I was in charge of getting tickets mhm guess by the way with the cheapest ticket is to game two of the World Series CL it's a thousand that's crazy looked up per person uh yeah damn it's insane it I think it's like one of the most expensive World Series games you guys in the Outfield right because that's where the damn home run we're in a place called right home run Club okay and I picked it cuz it gave free food that's it I'll come clean H hot dogs I wanted hella hot dogs he boy loves a bargain I love a bar I watched the game the game one grand slam while I was in Texas at a bar but I don't really know baseball or the context of why it's important so we're watching and no one at this bar gives a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about either team cuz we're in Texas so they they hit a grand slam and everyone just kind of like went back to eating and I was like oh cool I guess like that was like they win yeah and I was with a bunch of Dodgers fans and they were like losing their minds trying to tell me why it's important I'm like well then why does no one care the only time it's ever happened ever I didn't get that context cuz no one gave a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you also think that you could hit a a grand slam he does which is funny he thinks he could hit a grand slam game none of it I mean you just got to be able to hit a home run that's what I'm saying yeah I mean yeah it's like hitting a grand slam it's like just hitting a home run with threee homies on field exactly right my boys well if you guys are going to be out there I'll do it but if you're if you're not riding for me then anyway I rock up to this game first thing I do is I say I'm going to buy a show Jersey because I only have an angel Shi Jersey here we go oh let's go Jo up you think he he goes home and like watches a lwig stream I 100% think we'd be really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] good friends yeah I actually do I think me and Shi would get along [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] famously cuz you got you got along with you get along with so many normies and I think a baseball player is a extremely it's like the highest level skull level Normie but I think it's different no you're both Rich you both [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like animals you see that Meme it's like show how he doesn't speak speak English unless he's around white [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and then it's him just making a joke to like some white woman she cracks up he's like knock knock uh guess how much it's cost by the way I got fleeced 130 I'm going to say like $54 I bought it at Dodger Stadium during the World Series I'm going to say like $120 serendipitously fell my lap cuz they only had like xxxl and then a size 40 came through I don't know what 40 meant but I was like that's the lowest number I've seen all day M so I bought it $540 holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I didn't know to Che $540 I was I literally brought it to check out and she said that number and I was like I'm here that's crazy it is crazy so much you spent so much damn moneyone po cat well this was just for me can't lie he's like hey would you get me one wait stand Jersey well so we're at the we're at you know we're at we're at the we're at the seats and and uh what happened and the whole time bro I'm like man if they hit a home run here my dreams sh hits here I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] catch it it's not sh I think it's it's Freddy some other dude it's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] home run apparently these seats are fired because you can catch it and it's literally like it's Atri stands than me it's going directly over atri's head so it's like two seats down if he's going you ah I he's jumping for it looks like this he looks like he has Ms for hands and I think we could have caught it if I stood on the table and jumped from the table oh so it was pretty high the guy who caught it behind me was like this and it landed in there like like he had for the thr he had a glove too he had he did have a glove which is embarrassing I didn't know this it's embarrassing for adults to have gloves what wait who said this St told me this and I believe him why is that embarrassing it's a thing children do like children will bring a glove to catch a ball but like when an adult does it it's cuz like the ball's supposed to go to a kid usually but they're just future adults so it's like an it's like an adult wearing like a pin wheel hat and holding a big lollipop and being like I hope my baseball went in my glove it's like an adult going to a grocery store being like you got free cookies yeah yeah I get it it's like yeah I actually see I see the vision here so it's a little cringe but it's the World Series you catch a World Series ball gives a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] if someone thinks you're how much can you flip that for the sh one when he hit his 5050 I think someone caught that so he had some like historic stat in baseball no one's ever done 50 Steals and 50 home runs Someone caught the ball they offered him like tickets to the Dodgers for the next [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] season or something he said no I think it's on auction for like a quarter mil my God that's crazy wild I think it's something crazy like that that's that's the that's the total amount of all Mint Condition video games you've bought throughout your life pretty accurate yeah yeah I know yeah how do you know cuz I I bought them well and they're going up and they're going up up and up they're on their way up up check the price actually quite flat is what I looked up Pokemon Crystal quite flat flat can be goodat wi Flat's a win in Japan flat they would love flat right deflation deflation is the real killer yeah what they said and that's why inflation should go up assets voting jonald Trump what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is that zipper are you okay zipper died there's a new sound out there it sounded like Santa Claus murdered zipper yeah pile over the damn wall who was your who was your fortnite Friday dream guest um I always get asked that and like I I I never really have an exact name I used to say like Rudy juliani was like my dream guest but now I'm getting like too many political guests so now I almost can't even like yeah say that anymore I guess that like how do you how do you describe fortnite Fridays to someone who like you know not like a grandma someone you think has the capacity to understand why it's funny what would you say I say like hot WIS meets like Eric Andre when fortnite gotcha okay look at it yeah yeah so it's like yeah interview show but you're also kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with them what's wrong with Rudy what's wrong with Rudy yeah well I mean he's just a political gu you don't want to be the he a Masked Singer competitor he was on the that's what I know him for that's an awesome I was so when that happened I love doing the Mas dude when that happened and there was like a news report on it like I was waiting for months for that to come out like I was so excited I was talking about on the stream like every week I'm like when is it dropping when is it dropping oh and then they cut it like they went on YouTube it's there but they cut it from the the broadcast right yeah cuz like one of the judges like got all mad he's like I'm leaving not okay that he's here yo I don't like that you jerked off in that Sasha Baron Cohen movie dude a Rudy Giuliani interview but it's just two hours of asking about the mass singer yeah back to the mass let's go back to that New York's cool but yeah what a what a little Force you've created with the uh the fortnite Fridays cuz like the the George Santos people were tuning like it was it it was an event and it was very beautiful the word of mouth was crazy yeah we were talking about it like Kai just almost beat Millennia it was like the moment you got to tune in you got to tune in the moment I knew you had something special that no one else had done yet was when you were you were mid argument with him and he went down in the storm and then you picked him up and while you're carrying him like a baby you're you're arguing with him and not really letting him talk and he's also like I don't think it's a good idea you shouldn't grab me you shouldn't grab me the storm man it was it was great no I mean it's a great format it went great I mean I was just happy to like I've been streaming forever and like I just kind of do my own thing my own corner I don't use face cam I just play games like if you're there for my humor but like uh doing like something cool project like that that like it's cool to get attention for it but like friends that like really like it that's that's been cool yeah I've always I've always felt like you've had the appropriate perspective of irony in terms of this whole dumb thing of like streaming and and content creator culture like you look at it and like this is all so dumb in the same way I think I do uh I'm extremely jaded about it but I think you you hold back your jadedness you still got love in your heart yeah I mean I kind of have to like I got into this too young so it's like okay this is like my life and I have to like I I don't want to like totally hate my life going forward like I no no it's good yeah no it's okay not that you hate your life you can survive it no like everything that like I do like all like my friends like I've made since like I moved out from like home like moving to Austin was like college practically for me like all my like friends and stuff are like public figures say again didn't Austin blow no they Terry shut up it was a good time it was it was nice I'm asking questions they got Terry black just asking questions did it not suck I enjoyed it shout out to the guy I was just in Austin shout out to the guy at Terry black who watches the podcast he came in you know what he said to me he said look dude I've never been the star struck and I've met quo that's fun and he gave me everything on the menu for with his employee discount it was awesome I love I love there is like my favorite mac and cheese in the world I love that place but no so it's been like all my friends have been like creators and stuff so I kind of the recent years I'm like Oh my life is like consumed for Content whether I like it or not y so I kind of had to start embracing that more like I'm more on camera now than I used to be and stuff and getting better at all that why no face cam um there it's like a I'm just more comfortable without face cam usually I'll turn it on for like bits and stuff on occasion but I don't know there's like a barrier there that when that's up it's just easier for me to I'm the exact same my dream would be no face cam streams that people like just as much yeah cuz something about like I'm like I'm being observed yeah I just want the game to be I'm so hyperware of like being perceived cring get it yeah I wish I just like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and he'll just put a lamp in there and be like oh cool lamp and it's like shut up [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] likes the lamp so no it's actually it's practical lighting it's antique it's a practical and it's also antique and it's also special cuz I got it at the dirt there's those who understand the lamp and there's people who ridicule it so you know the lamp the lamp works I do like no cam streams in particular because they do feel like that old old school style like brawl Pro does it he doesn't use face cam yeah I think there's like a rhythm to it too that like if you like if you have a face cam you can almost like maybe I'm just weird but I can like see when the streamer looks at chat and kind of how they're pacing like how they look at things or like if there's no face cam like they don't know if like I'm reading chat and I can bounce off it in like a certain way better almost like there's like very little Min Sor I was having sex with two women wasn't responding to anything naked sorry it was silent for 5 minutes while playing the game I was getting head yeah was focusing on getting head oh man you a picture of the guy getting head but it looks like a guy's giving him head pause this is a famous picture I didn't see that one I redownloaded Twitter I just deleted it yesterday dude okay Nick from your side okay now Connor everyone see him from the side does he have like a pomp going on like he's on a in a rockabilly like band I think his hair's kind of always like that no I think it's pomed up I slept on it so it might be a little pomed up can you can you give me a a Johnny Bravo impression like a um mama hey hey M what the hell is that was that I Haven seen it's just Elvis just do Elvis mommy I'm a bad mommy I don't know what he says El elv talks about he you sound like eore you ain't nothing but a hound that's a melodic that's crazy this is the worst Johnny Bravo of all time you you you do Johnny Bravo Conor thank you thank you very much okay there goes terrible it's better than Carson yeah that might have been a different Johnny I got joh oh my God so what's what's your big goal man I mean like not even counting the the the trying to get Haley wel acknowledge you oh my God give up on her I Prett much have at least with like Twitter like I have a new in with her that I'm what we're seeing the person who I need to give up on Haley Welch actually is Northern Lions librarian yeah who's that uh the Librarians just post Northern lion Clips on Twitter and and YouTube and they're great I Love the clips I Love the clips but they've been just quote retweeting almost every Haley Welch tweet it's just like it's like Haley being like I love Bitcoin shark it's not even fun anymore like it's so obviously like she like it's not her it's like some scam that her management is running it's so stupid it it it would literally like be like watching you know 45 minutes of Aiden going against a seven-year-old in basketball pretty much and it's like the first minute is like this is electric and after minute 15 you're like okay the score is 78 to4 yeah Aiden Calvin taking the charge again taking it dude he would he taking a charge get a seven-year-old that's a foul foul that's a foul Swedish they're driving to the room every time like there's no way to beat that there's no way to beat that that's the counter plate that's the that's what you're supposed to do poor guy God I hate that guy po what he say he's all right he's chill he's chill he's chill I like him he's a Vibe like even if you didn't have fortnite Friday like what's what's your big IDE idea for your career cuz you like you said you're bought in bro yeah I mean it's like the way I look at it is like the when I look at it as a job I get stressed and I hate my life so I don't do that particularly because if I set my goal is just like to make myself laugh then I make other people laugh and then in turn because I'm lucky enough to be in the position I am already I can make money off that um and so I that's kind of just how I look at it like I don't I could definitely monetize and optimize my life life a lot more than I do um and I don't and I think that there's like a level of like authenticity to that some stupidity too but I don't know I just I feel like I can be Conor eat's pants and like can do like Vlogs and I can do streams or I can do whatever and that's just I don't I try not to think too far ahead or else I'll get stressed do you think Ludwig's inauthentic cuz he fully optimizes every part of his life when I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up honestly like if it was anybody else yeah but he managed to it's weird huh he's like's really balanced and sincere even though he doesn't have time to and I Walk the Line he walks the line just like Johnny Bravo exactly that's a song that is a song from an artist whose name I don't remember you don't know it's Johnny Nash Johnny Knoxville Johnny Johnny Nash it's Johnny Knoxville you got it second try lck's just a good guy now you were mention in the uh the digging straight down thing in Minecraft like that was a clip of mine that went viral like in early 2019 and like I lwig knew of me I thought lwig and Crush were the same guy for like a year like Crush from melee I think yeah I really funny CU I would watch Summit and so similar bracket performances I watched his I knew his streams famous famously see why that mixup would be there in 2018 and then when uh that clip went big on live stream fail lewick immediately messaged and was like go live go live like you're top of live stream fail and was like I was like oh awesome you little strategist you my dog back got my dog's back I remember l once told me that you so you've been you been watching melee for a long time you've been in mangoes chat for a while yeah I'm like 115 month mango something like that and then you you blew up and then lwig was like dude Mango's like mean to Connor now he was mean he was mean initially because he didn't know he's like I don't know how to like test the waters but now he loves me again no that's that's phase one of mango becoming your friend mango will just start being mean to you out of nowhere yep Mango's doing this thing with me recently where he acts like I've abandoned him oh my god when was the last mango L Fridays it it's it's been a minute but that's G oh that's not oh that doesn't matter to Mango oh work work is what would make us closer like what are you even a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] robot have some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] love in your heart hly I have said this brings me closer to you cuz I love it it's wor that's a good point wait you actually think this brings you closer see specifically my argument is that this is what I'd rather be doing with my friends anyway the fact that there's cameras on is just a bonus but they see it as me trying to trying to double up that makes sense then it had like get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] paid I've had like a weird experience well it's just like I like we haven't done content in forever but like I don't even think about doing it because I'd rather just like hang out we chilling Vibe I'd rather us four hit a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] blunt talk about like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stars no you don't don't I would you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lying I would genuinely love that what what's what's the difference between us doing that on the yard and us doing that in the other room over there cuz the difference is we would be doing it performatively for them versus doing it performatively for each other to make other look at it as performatively I don't think slime SE like this perform think you consider yourself one of my best friends yeah why the weird answer I answered the question yeah that's still an answer the pause felt like a year it felt it felt like the longest moment of my life I mean Archie can you put up exactly how long that pause is yeah put a speedrun timer up for how long it took him it was the fastest anyone's answered that question today lewick sincere answer RTA can you ask him lwi will you consider yourself one of my best friends yes he's pretty quick with that one at least right I don't actually think I need to it was a setup for a own the second question I the second question it was insane to ask him to do that I just thought'd be funny to pause turns out it was oh yeah like consuming like friends content has always been a weird thing to me cuz like once I become friends with somebody like I either like most time we talked about this at one point like you do listen to like Friends Podcast but like I I don't like after like the first few episodes of the yard like I stopped listening because was like that I I'm the opposite if I know someone I like watching their stuff more I say oh except for C was like like 180 in yeah she was little yeah she she got a a three-digit episodes in she's like I guess it's time to stop listen like I think she downloaded rocket money I think but i' be like listening to like Friends Podcast and like i' find myself be like oh like I can't join on this conversation like I'm like I I hang out with these people regularly and I can't like I'm not in this conversation strange there was like even like a few weeks ago like I'd actually listen like whine about it because I don't usually because they talk about like periods and stuff yeah like I was in the car and like Maya misrepresented a story like she told a story that like I was involved in I was like is such a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like you didn't tell that right like you didn't tell it as funny as it could have been and I spoke up the car and I was like wait she can't hear me I was so annoyed I spoke up in the car that's F you're screaming your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stereo I think I think I got better at specifically making slime laugh from listening to bad melee CU I would like hear a bit and I'd be like this is what I would say here and then I would just like in my head I think I would internalize a way to make him laugh that I didn't realize you mean the old days yeah yeah it really is like the best way to like improve like what we do podcasting or like streaming is just like Rel listening like what you do like I figure out like timing and stuff like so much better like rewatching like how the chat was or how the way I phras something or tone you watch a little tape yeah there's nothing wrong tape you got to watch film I'm hungry yeah you're hungry you're busy everyone before I was busy oh you didn't have 2 minutes you have 2 minutes you were on your phone for 2 minutes well I did have 2 minutes but but how do you make food in 2 minutes there's no options for that there literally are and the the thing is you know that that's what's disgusting this is going to be me cuz I don't have any two-minute food options it's going to be me soon it's not going to be you there's nutritious Chef prepared meals delivered straight to your door that can be ready in two minut stop spanking the SK factor factor stop tell tell him about it this is my son and he needs to hear about it if you want to put some meat on your bones you should be getting the Protein Plus Factor meals with o over 30 grams of protein per serving yeah you can even have there's 35 meal choices end up 55 weekly add-on

bones America's one no America's number one meal kit I want to go back to this why haven't you abandoned mango why is he wrong cuz I still [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hit him up every seven weeks like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] when I need something I I actually think it's been longer no I think that you undershot it what he does is he messages me and he'll say like maybe I'll message him and I'll be like hey man do you want to come to Lacs or something like that or like hey man do you want to like come to world's greatest or like hey man uh Lakers are in town or some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and and he'll be like he'll be like well well well or recently he's needed St like he signed up to Lacs and he's like ah I kind of want to instead of going to Sunday go to an Eagles game in town and a Lakers game back to back and I'm like can't do that yeah sorry you can't you just sign up for the thing and he's like wow Yo's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ruined my life I'm like I don't feel like I'm doing that and he's like okay you owe me one box sweet and I'm like this is a weird negotiation I it's a big stretch he jumps he jumps but he's playing a lot of Rivals of ether too so I'm cool with it let's go I'm cool with it Rivals 2 is sick well who you play I play Claren but I played Claren in Rivals 1 so it's like I feel like I yeah everyone gets cred if they've touched the earlier game if you touch Rivals one you instantly get so much cred me and me and lwig I remember famously we it was at smash camp like 2018 there was just a a quiet like rival set one setup that was just on and I'll look at him like you want to play a money match neither of us has played it before at all I don't even remember who I selected I just spammed one button I won never played again go yeah I got mad it was awesome I got really mad no Shield was hard for me yeah and I was like well you don't need Shield men you can just attack and I did and I just kept trying to Shield God he was so mad are you surprised lewig at Rivals 2's uh raving early success or was this about what you expected I think it's about what I expected I think what's much more telling is how it does like in a month yeah I age cuz like multiverses did pretty well off rip and it's still doing actually pretty decent but Nickelodeon All-Star brawl did pretty well off rip that game's dead now it's like it's like 18 concurrence that game's doing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] there's a fear there where it's like but rivals like an you know people played it the first one it's a sequel right I think what matters much more is like okay are there a few thousand people playing this every day like a couple months from now and if there are that's great because that means everyone can find a match pretty easily and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] uh Tekken only has like 5K concurrence and people are like this game's kind of dead which is crazy cuz it's Tekken and also dead and it's like yeah it's also not true and like you can find a match pretty easily right uh it depends really but I guess cuz ranked ranks depending it depends on your rank but it also depends on like the time you Quee but people who are really good find their Quee times get way long but like the middle of the pack people like me like it's easier but I'll also say on Street Fighter all bra bra Pro play out a hello oh my God good he plays lot of Street Fighter yeah I got you and it will he'll play against the same guy like over and over in his bracket rank but that's like the biggest fighting game online right so it's just the way ranked works that's just the way fine I was uh I was queuing Rivals last night or I was trying to we were here and uh and I waited in queue for like 15 almost 20 minutes just no no match and I was just like I was in my head about it I'm like oh my God offering games like we're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] no one's even [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] online I was just in the beta still even realize it dude people do that there you'll see like like the beta Spike to like five players a day yeah that was one this year and they all got to be like this game [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sucks can still play the local match so I was playing locally here and I was like all right I'll go ranked and I just couldn't find a game uh I switched over no ravels 2 is good like it people were kind of if on like adding like Shields and like pretty much bringing in all the core smash mechanics but I actually think it was good because like sure it's the first like smash clone to call it that that I feel like nails like all the aspects right and like a way I want to play it have you guys gone back and tried melee again after playing Rivals for a bit no dude get ready to if you play a lot of Rivals m get ready to not be able to move at all so buttery in Rivals when you I put I went back and played one match of Falco and it was like it was like when I started playing I was just like holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I can't move that's how I feel like going from like pm to melee even oh wow I would like cuz PM was just like smoothed out enough to where I would go back to melee and be like what the hell's going dude it was ins it's like cuz it just feels like in melee if an input is like that it's like in Rivals it's like it's rounded off and it's like everything is just easier no sharp Corners yeah which is way it's better it is better I think it's I honestly think it is an enormous reason why so many players are already good because they're not giving up when they hit the mechanical wall yeah they don't fight the engine as much like you do in Mele I think it's a great game to get me more in touch with the idea of seeing like an elephant's big juicy balls you know what I mean I think I think when I think Rivals I think I would [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] every one of these animals especially uh the whale well they're all kids no they're not are canonically they're all s they're all seven that's why it's Rivals rule 34 adult orane wet adult orcane all right what Rivals of ether 2 character would you like to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the most let's go around orcane wet adult version obviously it's like Vaporeon from zomers it's like Shamu just to be clear oh my God it's small it's one of the smaller characters in the game you dumbass and I bet it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Kane's actually like solid size like no but I'm talking about height height wise yeah low to the ground need to make oran's eyes you just hate the idea of being with someone's sh taller than you are that's not true but I like that orcane squirts oh my God so crash what that's what they literally watch the game squirts all over the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] place oh the bubbles land on the ground and guess what it's slippery well yeah there's a bit of Squirt but it's just crass it is crass as say so it's crass to just say what the truth is that this game is for squirter it's squirt it's squirt friendly Fleet oh safe Choice dude yeah I'd [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Peach like yeah I would we can squirt too by the way now that's crass why cuz there's no bubbles you're just saying that from a sexual point of view is there can you your whole argument was about bubbles too because every time he says like squirt he like looks at lead my argument was not about bubbles so I put that out there look look up look at brows of ether rule 34 I want to see if it exists oh my god dude are you kidding been around for a while no I'm saying R of ether to rule 34 excuse me any game that has to Proclaim we are not a furry game has rule 34 of it I feel like we don't I have not looked it up yet you're crazy dude you're so just embrace it bro I mean it's better wait flash again come back put it no put it come come back over here young man show me what you were working on my God is that zetterburn with a a finger in his mouth go to the bottom Zurn that looked HD as hell wow no not that one not that one the bottom right the bottom right dick is that is this under Rivals I think I think don't say do you draw it okay well forsburn is cut if anyone wanted to know I should not have said that I think they're Brothers wow it's like a cloud of smoke and then a just a dick coming out of it it out of the smoke there's Zurn with big look at his Bush that's crazy oh my God heut so detailed dude and Zurn does a clone while you're bad dude is this AI cuz of the uh the words on the can that'd be kind which can it might be AI you know and that's we were saying this a couple episodes ago AI is going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rule 34 There's No Love in there [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it it's going to make it like better no no there's no love bro the part about drawing weird [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like this is that the other guy or whoever beating your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and then an AI comes up you're like a yeah the robot tells me how to beat from Farm to goon cave that's real rule 34 I want that they should crack down they should crack down on AI post agree with you put it through that thing that grades people's tests but it's B bur this is a big issue on Pinterest for sure it's a big issue on every [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] platform What specifically like cuti us Pinterest a lot as like a place to make like mood boards and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for like cakes she wants to make or whatever and then she just gets like AI cakes and a lot of viewers send her AI cakes and she's like you can't make that can't make that that is a robot look at the hand but that's the most fire stream idea ever she did it oh sorry idiot she's already one step ahead yeah do you think women don't think oh whoa and the first sight Tom and Jerry that was really good so what's your dream what was your dream of coming on the yard is it everything you've ever thought about I just want to do a podcast with my friends why don't you do a podcast um I've talked I don't know like I feel like my stream is already kind of like a podcast enough and then like no it's a stream I mean fortnite Friday is a podcast fortnite Friday's kind of podcast I think schlatt and I might do one next year at some point you and schlatt are going to do podcast I've I've been saying we'll do it next year schlatt's the podcast killer me me and schlatt yeah he is he makes podcast just to kill him me and schlatt been talking about starting a Call of Duty Clan yeah called the Dirty Boys I don't like when you call it a clan but that's what it is it's a clan it's got rankings yeah yeah it's got hierarchy was that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Alex came up with I no I was at a PSL that was hurtful that's hurtful to me for sure oh is that a PS you wouldn't have named it that did he did name it penis starl but that's it Steve Jobs and the other guy he's Steve Jobs he's wnc for sure I'm yeah you're wnc I didn't even know who that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] was uh at PSL yeah it was Alex and Jay Jay's up and they we were joking about oh my God or some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you're you're talking you're talking about their their their the First Energy drink with creatine yeah yeah uh it was called what was it called just nonstop talking about the Red Bull sub flavor names oh he loves a Red Bull subreddit we were talking about the Red Bull subreddit they got throat grabbing grape yes and then he starts riffing I thought riffing and he's like he's like oh dude I thought of my own energy drink company it's it's uh it's like energy uh drink but it has creatine caffeine and alcohol and we have flavors already it's throat gripping grape and and a bunch of others and I thought was joking then he shows me mock pictures he had made of this dude get some you gave him a little bit you're you're on the podcast um what was the name of your your energy drink with creatine in it uh throbin Mike throbin miks can you give me the flavor list the what the flavor list um there was throat grabbing grape backshot Berry and then my favorite was bad apple we were trying to remember what that was thanks dude that's all I needed yeah let me know let me get the ground yeah yeah we got you help me get off the ground Bad Apple I love that guy dude you know what's crazy is how like I knew of them like separately I didn't even realize it was like friends cuz yeah well we you know how we became friends right it was through you played Cod or something right no we uh we were on the same haunted hay ride at at an October Fest oh my we were we went to we went to what's it called not the October Fest like the yeah like the big and Mike Mike knew Alex already Mike followed Alex on Twitter and we were in this massive line of people like over a 100 people in line and uh Mike was like I know that guy from Twitter just recognized him from face and then we happened to be on the same ride and then we ended up hanging out after people find each other dude it's just how it I know dude meant to be I I want to I want to Hash something out maybe have even a crash out has out a crash out settle this right here right now the third episode of hash out or crash out we have first sign on game no I'm the host guys no you're hashing or crashing I am obviously the host of hash out or crash out no you can't part of this yeah I I could tell he's about to hash out or crash out on us I'm conted it's between you and lwig what that's right you're forcing a hash out or crash out I'm forcing this welcome Connor you are my co-host to hash out or crash out and you can actually give some insight into this okay streets are saying that lwig said that PSL got too sweaty and everyone that I've talked to about this said lwig is actually capping no rules were changed from one PSL to another and that was just a per sweaty perceived sweat on your part uh for whatever reason maybe you're bad at games maybe you're childish maybe you have a small penis who knows MH vary of fact I would like to open up the floor to your argument lwig uh well the the argument is pretty simple Nick practices that's too sweaty Nick and Yingling had practiced called of Duty before PSL true or false there was one PSL Y where me and Nick Yingling uhhuh threw grenades on Terminal and they practice lineups with their grenades and guess whatling the only one who uses themess what oh for sure no you use them no I don't oh my God he's a freaking Capper he's a freaking Capper let me just say I do not have to practice to win PSL wow still does isn't that I mean I I I just feel like the skill disparity in in MW2 is just too apparent like I I I can't keep up like MW2 is we that's your co-host we haven't playing your co-host talking about it being too sweaty right now well I'm just trying to I'm just trying to figure this out okay let me let me let me show you how PSL goes ready I stand up hey what game do you guys want to play today lwig Alex everyone they're like they're like this they're like whatever whatever whatever I resent that he thinks we're on our phones whatever you guys want it's all good yeah cuz here's what I do here when I go to PSL he's got he's got he's got he's got horizontal he's got a horizontal like you're watching video sure sure I do have a horizontal video playing all right yes yes do I have a League of Legends VOD playing right here yes no no no no no not a League of Legends V playing you're playing League of Legends you're just in the other room playing League of Legends playing leg that was a great game I was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] second on the on the leaderboard so it was a great game obviously you should shut your mouth I mean I feel like how it actually with you is you're in the gym until like eventually it finally starts and we're like lwig it's starting and then you finally come in okay you don't pick theame why don't you here you lick your lips a new SE a new section of hash out or crash out is is a Love or host where we decide me and you um how would you improve PSL and I'm just listening not even arguing finally a man like me yeah I'd make it for the people how would you do that by the people that's how okay is it currently not by the people no is it it's by me it's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dictatorship and if I were to make PSL great I would make it American okay like the great KLA Harris once said she said a lot I she say so much she said shrimping grits [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's for lunch you know what Nick does a PSL what this is a real story what and Nick God bless his heart he's the only reason PSL exists y oh my God that power is driven to his head one time he ordered a personal pan pizza left nothing but the crust and said you hungry boys that didn't happen a he threw it to us like minnows this is a lie I feel he's talked about the pizza thing Pizza G might want call Pizza thing start and that's what I'm saying he's explained like I will get pizza for everyone I won't I won't get enough cuz no one raises their hand and then they say why did you only order one pizza now I I have sympathy for him here it was two pizzas it was two Pizza it still wasn't enough it was it wasn't enough but also bro the pizza he got cardboard yeah dude better with the pizza everyone liked it everyone stood up and cl I won't complain about a pizza that pizza was ass it wasn't great why don't you contribute to helping the pizza situation you know what I lowkey brought it up last time he go he goes to order this pizza I go ah dude Pizza on his fire it's another pizza place he goes ah everyone loves a spot and I got bet dude I'm so mad I'm so mad because I CU lot didn't show up last PSL ordered another pizza from the same place and everyone not everyone it was like the person who was it I think it was like Jack or who was there who was last were you there no someone was like dude this pizza is awesome what place is this and I'm like oh this place they wanted to know so there's mixed reviews they're making conversation Mi they're being nice I think what I'm trying to get to the bottom of is if PSL is too sweaty or not and what I'm thinking is that a lot of people don't agree that it's too sweaty no I I actually think it it doesn't matter if it's too sweaty it matters that teams are balanced in some weeks frankly teams aren't balanced like the week that schlatt wanted to team with his buds that was bad it wasn't schlatt who wanted that he was so mad no it wasn't it was it was it was Ted homie what's his name Tucker it was Tucker he was like we got to do like like Chuckles one team one team and Ted's obviously like sure and then Slash's like he tried he tried to leave their team after game one I was TR no I was I was before it even started I was like I'm not even on chuckle like I yeah that was so was imbalance it was what was it you and schlat schlatt Ted and Tucker yeah and you guys were creaming and they there was basically one team that ended up being the god comp their team was ass my team was mid it was my team so his team just ran I see I'm hit or missing like any game I'll their ball out or I'll be the worst player on the team time I assumed you were the goat at this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I got to address the the elephant with PSL don't call me that wasn't about you honestly a lot of your insecurities coming out today uh is Kelby Jesus Christ I'm you think I'm sweating or trying harder PSL I'm not I haven't even logged on until Kelby has started talking cuz he Lo dude he's standing up he's he he makes baby voices people he does not make babyy he goes he goes oh we're going over the plane we're going be a plant the bomb you're telling me a grown man named Kelby is trying to MOG people he I think he just gets a little ansy because it's not a Halo and I like I want to play Halo I'm not like MW2 like I want to play Halo 3 but are there are there other games that like are tra non-traditional L Xbox games like what if you guys fired up like FIFA dude last time we were talking we should all just boot up porn and watch the same video together yeah the fire idea just porn out the issue the issue with that is uh FIFA does not have system link I thought porn porn has system link does yeah there are some fire you know what sound off in the comments what should what should we play for p system link PSL games that aren't necessarily Shooters maybe Shooters you there's a Wiki we looked at it of all the system link games that exist that you can do and cod's kind of just the crack one cuz I would love to come to a PSL where it's not like uh one of those games like more of a goofy I mean we could do a GameCube session I think I think I think the future is we have like as cool as the novelty of the 360s are we might need to move on to like a PC setup no that's just everything that ruins it you need to hear me out like once you go to mief col ction you just can't go back like when you play Halo in 60 frames it's just a completely think the thing about a computer land is you get to play every game that's ever been made you know how bad Halo is on [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] console it feels like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] every time we switch to Modern Warfare 2 people go is the is the FPS on is like a mod like what's going on yeah it's like nope no this game just had higher frame rate it's just so bad going 3 is 30 fpss like it feels terrible it might be like 28 yeah it like runs bad like bloodborne at 24 like that movie yeah that's cool your grandpa's trying to make it motion smoothing come I got I got a j tag now dude PSL is about to be lit oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we can play prop hunt all sort of junk dude I'm down to go I've just been out of town it's always on weekends let's go this week let's do it this week I'm busy it is a busy week bro it is world when is it going to end for you man when is the pursuit of capital going to end for you do you think I'm doing a pursuit of capital uh yeah all the time no it's to be broke kill your it is to feed the employees I'm a whole company my man you're set you're fed and now you're and you're like oh now it's time to stop no I'm doing other things no you're saying for me no yeah I you know what this is just manifesting i' you're just so busy and I miss you hi and it's a lot of it's my fault but it's also your fault okay I don't think it's your fault bro how was nepon nepon did you miss car I did specifically him every time I said Conor I went I went uh I'm cheating you're mad at me for that still I think for getting another Conor yeah I mean it's just that his name is spelled the exact same way like we can't even like do like a bit where it's like oh you have like one in or like an e like it's like we're spelled the exact way yeah I would think I'd be more pissed if I didn't love him too you know what you guys should do is you should play some sort of showdown game that you're evenly skilled at and the winner gets Connor rights for lwig for like 6 months I actually think Cod would be decent for them yeah I think yeah he was pretty good he's pretty decent next PSL dude we should do we should do PSL salty Sweet Week where it's you vers cutie and Halo oh the yeah we do a lineup so good me vers Aiden o and what loser dies and it's melee and he has a mad cats controller I actually think you Moog him in every game we play at PSL You' like waterboard the loser he he was decent a codo actually no he couldn't play it right no he was dude okay I you joke but how funny would it be if we just waterboarded someone at PSL it would be funny you can waterboard somebody for like a little bit and it's like kind of it's like goofy we do with Red Bull yeah yeah no we can't bring up literal torture methods with my sponsor I'm sorry oh my God you know what a torture method you know what my personal torture method is is when you don't show up to the goddamn group chat and say hi to me so now what yeah you know what I owe you a big one by the way you big one yeah cuz I was a I was a I was a sad man when I arrived the day back I I came back from Japan and I bailed on the yard bailed yeah it's okay I we we were kind of like you know what that'll happen cuz you tried to schedule a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] episode when you got off the damn I was confident I was like I was like Love's going to I didn't put it together till the day of like he's going to do a podcast episode The Day of His Landing off like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] how long is it fight like 14 hours it like 11 oh I'm like like there's no way he's going to want to do that think about nepon how much he damn misses it yeah dude Conor how much understanding that one dude I picked up a nasty smoking Habit in Japan no yeah I was like yeah I'm going to do this thing now if I'm traveling I can smoke and then I was like was a bad idea you were already doing that I tried to like understand all the time yeah but this trip was longer oh so more smoking so more smoking so it's like if you do a monthlong trip are you still doing it like when does it the cut off like a buddy of mine uh when he started seeing his girlfriend a long long time ago uh he was is like he was like no no if you cheat in a different area code it doesn't count and I was like cool that's not true that's just not true what you talking what do you mean not true has be like a different like pre like a different like in front of them like plus one is us it has to be like has be different country that's when it's that's that's when it doesn't count yeah oh man no he's cool tried smoking but the Japanese smoke it's gross what do they smoke iOS it's like the most popular nicotine device it's the picari sweat of cigarettes I guess you could say that yeah it's a different technology though it it it looks cooler than vaping kind of but it's basically vaping but they don't like vaping oh it's like it's electronic though yeah look up an icos iqos it's basically like this little like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] device and then you throw in what looks like cigarettes into them and it Heats it up without like uh cooking it or like burning it you know what's funny that he was always about this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] from his old ass job too where he was a merchant of death yeah yeah true wait this one's also called IQ yeah wait this thing's cool yeah they literally look like pens they do this cuz they can smoke it inside and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] have you ever smoked cigarettes Conor yeah like I tried at one point or I think I was with you or something you were like don't don't you like don't get started on cigarettes you bad [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't remember the context but he was it was like he he was in the area or something and I was like should try cigarettes like I should like I should get in a ni around that yeah and I was I tried it and I was like this isn't even like that cool go back to what I was saying though what I said to you then Mar don't get on nicotine that's what he was saying he was trying to be good inflence thank you

a you it literally looked like an IOD Nano I don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] BR that was a healthy alternative to vaping no it wasn't it was a healthy Vape I remember hting I remember hitting one of those and it was like it malfunctioned and it just tasted like burnt popcorn cuz the cotton burnt out yeah my fault yeah you got to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] replenish that buddy I remember when you hit that you were stressed I was stressed he was stressed out it was Zero nicotine no it wasn't it was one Ben head that's one of the funniest things you've done while stressed you were like let me hit that Vape let me solve my problem really fast this is like 20 this made the problem worse dude I did that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it was I I cuz I thought that's you're supposed to do when you were stress and then I I like saw my girlfriend cheat on me and I was like I'll buy a cigarette and then I I bought one but they didn't have any so I bought cigarellos dude and Swisher Sweets yeah but then rather than smoke it outside I did it in my room I put a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] uh towel under my door and I open the window and then my roommate comes in and he just laughs he's like what are you doing dud we can all smell I'm trying I'm trying to kill myself in here it's over for me man I dude speaking of I went to New York with Josh man this weekend he won the tournament which is awesome shouts out our moist M he's so back uh but I I booked this hotel cuz in Brooklyn they like banned Airbnb and like hotels are like weirdly hard to find there so I just booked a cheap one that was close to the venue we we check in and it says uh 3 hour rate and it had a price for 3 hours in case you didn't want to stay like a love Hotel a whole night yeah and so so we stayed in a place where y'all got a f minute rate yeah you bring what what Josh called pries wow that's such an Australian way to say that so we stayed in in the pry hotel and they had a they it was fun they had a cage around the smoke detector so you couldn't temper with it yeah uh but it still smelled like cigarettes I like broke out it was ter it was so miserable you broke out in my skin like I like broke out this a really rough Hotel yeah but at least we had a ton of sex with each other so that was really nice at the very least that's a plus how else he's going to win that tournament that's why he did did it for you also this is a question for you guys because we were asking everyone this if Josh and I were a gay couple okay who would you say would be the top and who would be the bottom you're the bottom you're the bottom 100% yeah I think you're probably the bottom yeah zipper said yep too that's crazy did you think he was every single person we asked was just probably like 2500 people they wrong they I was the top and a fierce one at that I mean 75 million Americans are going to vote for Donald Trump yeah a lot of people doesn't really make a difference okay Archie can you put a disclaimer before this section Josh don't listen to this yeah and then well you think he's even watching it for the discl he don't give a don't I just want to even if he does Arie can you also just with your own voice just say the most British word you can think of right now band great and it can't be a BOS Archie can you edit for free for me again wait wait wait wait wait did the Archie edit for you yeah he did the Nintendo trailer stff Arie was mine Archie was his dude actually you snip you probably created the yard then cuz you're probably you're probably part of how I found Archie yeah he is he did the he did the Nintendo he did my Nintendo Direct thing years ago where like that's a funny bit because like none of that ended up happening because I got tired and feel like doing well you still did him I did yeah well he like did the edit for it wow he did it for free yeah he's just Conor frog old fan he was a Conor frog he still I was like talking about it do it again Archie is the worst example of well he's a great example on his work ethic but he's the worst example of how to have like success as an editor because he's so wealthy from doing the yard but when I ask Archie for work I'll be like hey do you want to hop on this thing like not related to the yard he's like yeah like I'll just do it like or I don't know you can pay me like a hundred bucks or whatever and I'm like you're the richest guy who asks for no money yeah the game the the level at which you're operating you can be asking for what you deserve I'll just be like I'm going to pay you more than that Archie is that okay he's like yeah sure no sure I didn't pay him for three months once through the yard he didn't say [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he doesn't complain a lick yeah you know what we should stop paying him [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stop I'm tired of this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what's that br going to do Archie we're done keep editing you have no control over us what are you going to do blame it on the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mam no he actually he actually has something against uh or against me he has all the unused footage yeah which is honestly it's fine but the decom we say some crazy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah he hasn't released everything we've said before yeah right before the decom loads uh well there I think that yeah he has some crazy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] never mind Archie we're back you're good yay saved it's not the migrant's fault true it's a lot of factors I remember I remember the first thing Connor ever said to me I don't know why really it's still in my head I remember I was it was when it was the second house we lived in mhm um and wait yeah second house we lived in and it was somewhere around or right before the Among Us era for you I think it must have been but I got into a Discord call with him we were in we were in a call for the first time and it and we were trying we're doing some of I think we were playing among us maybe and it was just us we were the first two in the call and he goes hey it's a Falco that's a cool username I love that character and I thought he was making fun of me and I was like who the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is this guy no I play FAL but then I learned you love melee I was also like I think he kind of was probably a little bit think world view is that everyone's trying to MOG at all times no that's my world actually not I actually I actually love and trust people and I find out they're making fun of me I'm like oh well it's also what he deserves cuz he fought tooth and nail to get that username he loves his favorite bit D he did it's not a bit when you begged like an animal asked once I mean is that begging you begged yes but to be fair it it wouldn't work in today's world he got it at a time period where you could get that you can't anymore in elon's world you can't get that no well El Fair it's a it's a it's a base price now and it's five digits really even if you're a company yeah how much uh I think the last thing I I was told was like a floor of like 20 grand you know what I was thinking the other day like if you're I was in the doctor's office for my shoulder and I'm on Twitter and I'm like I kind of have a reason to be on X the everything app and like but if you're like I looked at like a normal person going there for like some whatever there is for there's no way you're doing this no what what are you talking about sorry go ahead I'm talking about like if if a regular person who like goes and does a normal job and lives a normal life if they have a Twitter account it's kind of weird now you are doing it what you're justifying you being on Twitter no I'm not Shing no I'm not shaming them and I'm not justifying it either I'm saying I have a weird uncommon reason to be on it cuz I'm like Le content creator you have no reason to be on it more of a reason than a than a person who doesn't have like a big that's true I don't think that's true I do I agree with slime [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you yeah you just don't have it on your phone anymore so I think you're projecting I think there's no reason to be on Twitter No sure that's a fine thing to think say easy one but I'm saying if you're a normal person who is just like watches movies and does stuff on having a Twitter account now is kind of weird cuz the way the website is now cuz like how it fires up Gore and how it's like super uh like the environment that it's in being on it is kind of like I think weird do you but you don't think this no I don't think that at all that's so weird I I think it's just your fyp experience as well mine is right now genuinely just Rivals of ether 2 little bit of Israel Palestine okay just enough to get the get the blood pumping yeah like 90% just Rivals of ether 2 combos made by the same people the makers of the war no no no the accounts cuz it's like five guys that run all the accounts so yeah it's it's all sides the League of Nations it's pretty crazy it's yeah it's nature is amazing and then uh the IDF i i rate dogs I think as far as all social medias I think that's fair like comparatively to I think Instagram's more for humans normally yeah that's what I'm saying like comparatively to Instagram that's I think more reasonable yeah but I still think it serves the purpose of a social media site like it connects you with other people in your life and I'm sure there a lot of people on X who just follow people in their life and go to the followers tab maybe is YouTube the only good algorithm uh I would even call it my Twitter recently I like don't even like scrolling it I'm like this is boring let's do it what's up dude screen time screen time I actually don't think mine will be that bad oh well mine's going to be bad we're going to pull up screen time for the past week folks if you don't know you can check the screen time it's been a b we are we doing daily average do last week oh here it is okay let's go most used Nick um okay my last week and can I get some context you just give it first give the number first give the give us the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] juice first I want to say the context first okay fine I was on vacation okay go ahead not vacation I was at a wedding so it's I'm using my phone a little more okay 5 hours 12 minutes of of my last week's average no of what what was the sorry give me your most used app last week was Twitter how many hours uh in the week it was 8 hours eight hours a day then I got to tell you no for the whole week your for you page is good I mean maybe it's bad in like a objective sense like what you're seeing is bad but it's working because it's keeping you on the website usually when I open Twitter if it resets to for you I slide it back over cuz sometimes it won't hold it the foll so I usually go to my following I'll do like a thing I'll see what everyone's up to and then I'll get out or I'll make a funny little reply I mean you're cleaning an hour a day what's yours Connor like which number what's your most used app and what how long everything app X everything how many hours 12 hours mine is YouTube 12 hours okay mine's x uh 19 hours damn which is crazy holy 19 yeah last week were you arguing last week uh I don't think so I don't argue that much these days X runs and then YouTube is my second yeah I have eight hours on YouTube 840 YouTube is already in the lead for this week for me well that's kind of fun Terri XC everything app we've found out that XC everything's app algorithm is working yeah it's working effectively for you three I think so I think I like talking on it which again I think if you're like an A A person who does not have a big account or any like reason to be on there as like a Creator you might have less of a reason to talk cuz you're just getting you're just flying you know maybe you're evil well okay here's my argument then you're saying there's less of a reason but you're saying there is a reason for the content creators to talk who do you think they're talking to uh I guess they're talking to the other the big tweets that come out they're talking to people they know other content creators I I I see what you're saying I see what you're trying to say but I think there's just statistically more of a reason um you need the unimportant people to make the world go around now that if Connor did not have fortnite if Conor did not have Twitter I think he would have a hard time getting guest for fortnite Friday oh a th% I mean that was a big factor that made it like do well the past few months I think that's one of the biggest reasons to have Twitter if you are a like content creator is your ability to contact people you want to work withh do you think fortnite Friday you inherently have to kind of disagree with the person that you're bringing on for it to be not at all I mean I had like good episodes earli this year with like Mckenna Grace was like the actress and like Ghostbusters it was just like a viewer of mine that was fine like that was just a fun it almost feels like the real core thing that that maybe this isn't even true I I'll say it anyways is that they are somewhat clueless about fortnite yeah because it becomes such a distracting point for them that it's hard for them to interview but you force them to keep interviewing yeah so like I try not to do like streamers at all or like any creators like that yeah is it is fortnite the best vehicle what if it was a different game it's definitely good will the literation with Friday is good huge but then also just like the concept of the game is very simple like everybody knows of fortnite just because of how much of a cultural impact it had so that helps I think there's a clear thing you want Victory Royale there's so much IP in the game like when when you were like I'm OJ simp like there's so many things to play off of he like oh my God and then like there's also like a whole another like the whole Roblox end of it now where there's like creative in fortnite games she looks like Hulu in there it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up they make so much money there's so much stuff in there now that you can just do those people who make maps make so much have I told you guys before no they make a hella yeah they changed how it works so they started paying out map makers for how many players I tell you this yeah they're making like eight figures some of them I'll still I'll never forget when you interviewed Susan WJ jinsky rip the that her team was there at the house and we were talking about YouTube and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and he was saying like Elden ring right now when Elden ring came out I was like Elden ring is like is so big on on YouTube it's overtaking fortnite this is in 2022 and I'm like fortnite forite is still that big and you looked at me and you're like fortnite is that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and then the guy looked at me and then you and then was like yeah I was like that's crazy I don't know maybe that's still not the case maybe it's just it's kiddos right there's just so many kiddos who like fortnite I mean there adults like it too at just it's a it's a cross everyone loves fortnite OJ Simpson being in fortnite is not for 12year olds when we die fortnite will be considered the greatest that was an accident on their part they haven't brought back that version of the skin because they realized that like people were like doing that it was custom it was I did like it was like a year ago my favorite thing was cuz Marshall Ms got added into fortnite so I was playing fortnite listening to Kim full blast dude they should do they should do an Eminem Like skin variation where it's him and his daughter's wedding oh and and you have dunks on and you've got you've got uh tuxedo yeah a great idea wedding day it's like wedding day Mario I try to get like every like real person that comes to the game because you never know what they're going to do and it's like are they not going to bring this skin back like I have I got like Will Smith before the slap no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and they haven't brought back Will Smith they took he hasn't come back to the shop they from yeah they haven't never taken a skin away from be crazy but to like take away a skin someone purchased I mean if someone do something really bad I mean yeah if Will Smith [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] shot up a school I think it's fair that probably remove him from the game yeah imagine they didn't they stood on it that' be but if like slaps a guy and they remove remove all your hard-earned v-bucks yeah uh that would suck that would suck they should you know how they do concerts presidential debate in fortnite fortnite I'm I wanted to do that on fortnite Friday I tried dude that's a bad idea what do you mean you wanted to you mean you wanted to get Donald Trump and K haris I wanted well so I figured that wouldn't happen so instead like I got in touch with like all these like genin Z political influencers on Twitter you R the Jubilee like the ones yeah like the ones that are like 18 19 like obviously paid by like their respective parties I found a bunch of them and like one for Trump one for K and one for RFK when he was still in and I was like Hey I want to I want to just get a fourman squad and like I'm just playing the game and you guys can argue about whatever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the whole time and like I'm just playing the game wow it never came together because dude you should let both sides like conco a tweet for the other person's account and if they don't get the victory Royale the tweets go out would be the issue was the kid that I had for Trump I ended up talking to him more because he ended up being the kid that got be uh him and he's friends with Baron Trump and so he got [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Trump to go on Aiden Ross's stream dude Baron Trump on Fort night Friday be fire yeah I was trying to get that he was like Baron Baron says he won't do any media right now yeah he hasn't done any right I think he might be evil like like evil evil I mean he getting the thing yeah because he won't do four Fridays with you no I think that he's being very very mindful of how he's he gets social media very well and he's like I'm not going to be any public appearance I have planning my future and he's going for power for sure he wants power well dude the the weirdos there there are weirdos who like played they called playing dollies where they like post a picture of Baron and like he looks like a Roman like Emperor marel profile picture yes and they're like look at him son son of the powerful this is what leadership looks like he's going to lead us one day reading between the lines I think he's hyper aware of all of that and and is like actively like he's probably been taught all that bro he probably went to that private school that like all the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] presidents go to he went to well he went to the same school as that one kid I was talking about just like some some regular school I don't know like Beach School the people like that get put into schools where and they end they end up in secret clubs and societies that like they only get revealed when you die at your there there's a school Z can you look up the high school that like eight presidents have gone to it's like a weirdly high percentage of presidents just come from this one priv school they just took could I don't know what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they're teaching there that's crazy maybe psych 101 that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Crush it's crazy to think like aristocracy like that still exists in like the kennedies yeah like they it's real bro they's still like these weird little socities it's the same thing as like a basketball player creating a child who's good at basketball like you just know everything it takes to get to the position you in so you can just teach that to your child yeah but I think that's also less about like sometimes they're just born like not tall enough with basketball or something yeah the difference is if you're a politician I guess the only thing in that case is you just have couldn't be bald zipper you have to be charming and handsome where's our that's true info is he gone Z do you not hear me zipp's getting Z yes I heard you Z's getting mad at Nick no mad at you too I didn't say anything wrong I did not say anything wrong Baron's an evil name yeah it is it is a funny name also a fire grocery store Pizza Baron Red Bar Red Baron yeah it's also the name of Baron Harkin Phillips Academy Andover it is the AI overview so that might not exist okay well two of them how many hands that two of them are the bushes though so that's like not fair wow n this this ain't no five five five yeah yeah it's on the right it's on the right it's on the right show me is it just Yale show me it's just Yale Yale classically a Connecticut school yeah it's famous it's huge in Connecticut everybody talks about it there all what what if that was a stupid freddit post just said what if all presidents went to the same High School president High president high and they all dude and there's like there's like Thomas Jefferson but he's got to talk with like Obama oh that'd be a good collab yeah the Epic Rap Battles of History predicted predicted the election yeah they they they favored in comma right they called it for Comm there was another thing too about what was crazy was the you know about the Washington they were formerly the Redskins now they're just Washington commanders there is a their last home game if if like for the past like couple of Elections their last home game if they win it then the incumbent party wins the presidency and Washington only won on like an absurd last Hail Mary that like the other team tipped yeah so it was like an absurd win by them but that was the thing well who would they fight for they fight for the incumbent be Comm would win whoa I like where we're trying to manufacture all these groundhogs seeing their Shadow I'll tell going to wined really I'm kind of getting I'm I'm getting a little Doomer that's cuz you're 12 hours on X I think so I think I'm just on X you're on an app owned by the guy who jumps up and down for Donald Trump and pays out a million dollars for people to vote for him he's sad he kind of sad dud he's a big X dude that's HP is I love X and content and blazing my you're being sarcastic you do love X I don't love it I just like pulling it up and watching it I do I like people watching I like talking to people with a big account I like having a platform to joke on like I'll go to El's replies I'll see he's talking and his like the American flag people and then like I see who replies to them and I'll just click on their account and I'll find like an old grandma like what does she talk about what is her life like it's like it's just crazy is she AI I think it's like yeah I have the same amount of free time on my hands as like a 70-year-old Republican woman so I I end up naturally on the website as much as can crush a bingo KN oh I I love Bing you do crazy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] at do

you're back with your best friends you actually eat [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] great food anyway so what Connor what you're you're finally here bro you're going to yell at us if you're going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] scream and yell at some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I mean so then yeah 2019 I joined the Minecraft server um you went viral um Connor's competing in world's greatest game the story from an hour ago is so sick he actually yeah oh nice I'm in world greatest almost said gayest gamer I I wouldn't win that bro I would no way last we got to play suck the Spire we got to play no he uh he's replacing who dropped oh phas adapt oh perfect I was going to chop it up with bro was ready for to PSL uh so Conor's in and he thinks he might take it I didn't say I think I might take it I you were talking High I said I think I might do pretty well because the games that are in it are games that I know and like day one has deadlock he said he was you're fine with deadlock he said he was Solo Carry deadlock I think I could he's good I like that actually good at deadlock oh T is I might be better than tens at deadlock do you think you're better than jerx at deadlock who's that I know jer's play he won the international twice okay let's in Dota yeah so he's probably going to be good you don't think that helps no it helps a lot it does I think if you play enough you the game enough like how the jungle spawns work and how the map works that like I could carry and like the characters that I play can be like Solo Carry characters I think uh I think lwig snubbed me oh wow he's made them the second most yeah he's the second highest earning player all time [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I I begged L last year right yeah yeah yeah yeah he did well yeah he did really well he was i beged l put me on commentary I think he snub me I didn't snub you I just haven't done commentary yet he he put put me in as a player and then he was like wait never mind this person's back in you can do commentary by the way I was like that's what he said that's what he said and then he's like nope you're back in as a player well I had double asked and then the person who I initially asked replied it was Evo the guy who did uh love yeah I just love Parkour Minecraft just have Josh play the guy who made Parkour Minecraft who does all the Parkour in it said he would compete initially but then said it was a face reveal for him and I was like I don't want to be your face reveal how come you didn't ask me to compete in it yeah or me this is my kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this is my kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this is not your kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] or your kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what do you mean it's exactly my kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] might be next sweating a bunch of video games League of Legends is the first team game I've been playing it he says Lux line play that game I play the character look like cdy swinny uh give me Lux line I want to see everything that's good that's good and I always and every time she says that I go God damn I'll call a void I'll tell him to do I'll tell him to DOD the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] winner I say hey we got a new winner in town my bad Rivals I'm doing great yep uh where all the game we had a deadlock I'm pretty terrible do you guys have Tekken I think not oh actually I have to look at the list again I don't think I remember seeing I don't think there were any traditional Fighters ttin no they're harder to get you have to have a licensing Fe for those how did youens Mario Kart and stuff this year were they actually down chill chill on that chill you chill n n over here there's there's some games that you do have to pay to use in an event clear huh Mario Party jamban jamb I'd be crazy at that you would be crazy at that have you tried domination on the new one no was it easier oh no it's the same it's just should be easier was a higher frame rate I've been telling them to try there's a mode they put in it that's surprisingly like well done for Nintendo where there's an online solo CU ranked for Mario Party mini games that's sick where like literally it gives you a number and you can get like gold plat and it's all just solo Q mini games oh I'm going to run that sick I was like how who did this like all their Mario parties have like sucked in the past few years where it's like you just know it was like you can tell that they like could kill a competitive system if they wanted to and they just don't they just don't they just don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but like at the past few games you can tell it was like the interns were like punished in the making Mario party it's like put it out put out the game and now this one they actually tried to make you know Rivals is better in that sense because again we can we imagine [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all these animals like so guilt-free like when we have to imagine [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Mario it's like well what's is he going to get back like to his job later on you talking about like bows there I think he was
