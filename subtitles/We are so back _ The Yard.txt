now what is did you buy this on like I wish you got your face painted young man yeah here's what I think because the BET was I have to get out D and D before your first Japan video and I said how much

on here's the thing brother we'll have the last episode out before it's been 3 weeks at this point you know what I'm saying like wait has it yes I understand your the first episode came out has weeks has it it's been two I think it's been three I've been gone to look look this is what happened cuz we're basic we're basically ready to release all we have to we have to switch editors and now Archie's the editor and I had to ship them all the drives and we were going to be on we were on Pace for 3 weeks and then every Drive is trapped in a warehouse and they won't release them the UPS is not releasing the drives to Archie they're just in London in a warehouse no way yes so that so they're not editing either so he's we said we had to then send him proxies sorry I didn't mean to throw that out there just if he doesn't have them yet they're also not edited right like hold on hold on I didn't know this was going this is news to me you're saying UPS is stopping the people from getting

we we like a good neighbor yeah and he brings it back he really he really got God he comes in so strong with that like a good and I go honk HK wow what a stellar return to form oh it's it's beautiful to have you back you know I will I missed you did you I you didn't come to see me I watched your videos you didn't freaking come to freaking see me he didn't evening but hey they they don't care it was the best episode all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] months dude I they don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] care I read the comments it's like I didn't even notice that is crazy to say am I crazy of course it's crazy they said I didn't notice Nick was gone because Michael filled the hole where somebody has glasses on the Shelf yeah it it be like having Joe Rogan on and be like Oh slimes actually people do that they actually just do this they do this every episode and Ludwig's gone it's whoever's gone they say I didn't even notice lwig was gone until an hour in [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you they said they said slime looks like he built like a pit bull funny cuz I'm kind of like hunched over and like breathing heavy cuz we're outside you were dripping there a good screenshot of like somebody just posted a timestamp and said this is the most French lwig has ever looked and it's you getting up from coming back to pee with the beanie on your your wife beater and your pants just pulled up to your waist and you do look extremely French you look good we can't we can't spoil the result of your video but I quick Round of Applause for for Ludwig's Japanese I I feel like okay okay what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on the first video I literally went oh my God he's speaking did I not tell you guys I do think I do think the captions are doing you some favors though yeah they are rounding out some of the I think I don't know the language no 100% but it feels there's a there's a difference in captioners so we have two captioners on the case captioner one is Nai and he was a lot tougher on my speaking he he would be like well he was trying to say this and at a stutter and then Anna's on captions 2 she's she's her other captioner and she's very generous to a fa almost it's funny that the the the bias the personal bias of the captioner can influence what is actually being said someone should do an English dub of all your videos of what you actually said in Japanese like an English D and it's like coffee I want head yeah drink it grapefruit yeah the captions do remove all accents there was we were at a Delaney was at a photo shoot with us today and she was like there's this funny part where uh where he said we go to Hokkaido and you're saying it to the guy you're talking to like let's go together to Hokkaido but you're trying to ask him how to get there we go to Al kaido honestly that's that's great for the great for the show if a guy just is like okay and now you have a third friend yeah and now we have him for the rest of the trip you allow someone to travel with you if they asked a rest Ranger not a f uh it depends on the circumstances if they had like a motorcycle yeah if they were like I'm going to drive a car in the gang you have to have a bike yeah that's fair I think that's fair it's fair to have Club rules uh we will I I can't leak much when does this come out this comes out w a in two days okay okay so yeah we we have to we have to retain some some juicy we have to retain some of the seen inside of us some of the seen will stay in but we did run into some people some people I guess freaking maybe did join us I don't freak know they adopted the company of a Japanese guy with a swasa tattoo I I'll ask the question I think all of us are wondering which is has Michael become a better friend to you than us is he is he your best friend when you look at Michael and you think about your friendship with him talk we talk we didn't do this is Michael like more interesting than us you think of Michael do you go wow we got so close in a way that I'm not close to any of my other friends I don't even like my old friends on the show wedding pyramid I was thinking of how much fun you were having and I was just like have I ever had that kind of fun it was all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] laughs it was just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] straight laugh imagine a fight between you two I could say bye we have one we have one fight I could do it but maybe but maybe a fight maybe the Friendship is about the fights maybe you have you trust them to have the fights that's why we're close maybe it's about [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up a flight booking or two you know maybe that's what it's about you're a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Aiden's out of the pyramid Michael's in okay that's why we need more support I think we lost a big beam what you mean the P well I mean he's more of like a you just demoted me from tier two to the bottom cuz I have to take it his place cuz Michael's definitely a tier two pyramid he'll be at the top of the pyramid brick the top of the pyramid he well he's smaller makes more sense are you at the base or no you're you're getting married I am getting married you're not in the pyramid you get to be in the I be weird if I was there what that's not right i' like to think myself as a I think actually the bottom of the period is more like is more noble it's more like you're structurally more powerful it is it is the way f means that you have good [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I think you should be I think that you should really be happy you should be flattered that I that kny doed so quick you guys learn that by the way did you figure out KN do yeah what is it you remember we told you at the end of the last episode knock any dsh is a way to say thank you yeah it means burst inside me please oh that that's the phrase please burst inside of me good thing I didn't say that to anybody nak C I called Yingling a pedophile in the restaurant next to Conor how do you do it uh uh wakari uh no it's Watashi no that's not it he pass he passed the test and now I just remember that I don't know the how to say you or or he is how do you say he is ana ana Shia Shia is pedophile yes and then what did everyone do stand up and clap uh Connor Connor said what what did you know what it was yeah and he said your Japanese getting pretty good man there you go thank you and Yingling was laughing cuz he didn't know what I was saying he thought I was playing a joke on Connor but it was I was like I was saying you see the pedophile right that was look I had a great time I think that was the most energized I've been traveling I want to say you guys need to treat Yingling better well no see see I disagree you see why is slime very interestingly on this vacation didn't do what slime normally does he didn't hermit in the hotel room he left the house so what caused it right Japan is the same as it was last time he had someone to follow around and Badger named Nick jingling Nick Yingling was a like an anti- tour guide he wasn't taking slime anywhere meaningful but slime got to just leech on to him and be and just be like you're my baby son now this is a strong Theory and I think if we bring Yingling everywhere we go Yingling gets to see the world which he loves and slime has a reason to leave the house we left his we did role play bean Yingling's parents for a large chunk of the beginning of the trip yeah cuz I wore Aiden's I didn't bring a jacket I was going to buy one I was on lwig mode and it was cold I'm like Aiden let me use your hoodie and he did and I'm like oh this is kind of comfy I'm wearing your jacket like I'm your wife I'm your bald wife now I'm your bald wife and so like for a day I was his bald wife and Yingling was our non-binary child our baby and that that was a you know that was for us baby's not gendered uh no you're right how would you say that's woke that's woke to say yeah no I'm not I'm saying you're bro no true it's big you to come from Japan and still feel that way they just legalized gay marriage in Osaka oh is while we were there it's while yeah it's while I was there they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do they still use the rainbow flag what the hell does that even mean like do Japanese people still consider the rainbow flag it's just a circle of the rainbow in the middle of a white flag so like is it they have one of the largest gay communities say I'm saying how do they represent that with a symbolic flag is about the size of this Warehouse it is so small relative to like West Hollywood uh yeah they still have the rainbow flag the pr flag and is there like a kanji on it no no I feel it's confusing whichi on the Japanese the gay Kani what's the gayi that they put on the flag they don't have they don't they don't need [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Mario Luigi kissing not fuing piku okay am I it's you watashiwa and then gay kanji Des you know which one goes there you there's no KY on the it's just the pride flag you're telling me there's no flag are Universal it's not like when you have the American flag they have like where's the sign for America how do they that's not right no that can't be right there's a circle that can't be right that can't zipper pulled up a pride flag with a Japanese circle in it that can't that can't be right pride flag I mean it's kind of fire yeah I mean this makes this is what I was thinking about every country has two hands on flanking each side of the circle you want to Goat see in the middle of the pride flag like Mario's gloves you want a oh you want a Mario go in the middle of a pride flag it's a little crass well welcome no it's culture it's C my culture is not your costume that would be costum medic it'd be noy doing the flag was goatsy a straight man or a gay man you know what that's a great question I think it's a good question go man is actually has a wedding ring on and I think that picture was taken in a Time legalized so we can kind of track down that he he was oh Kirk Johnson a pornographic model who participates in extreme penetration is Kirk Johnson gay would did not be depending on the state in 199 might pornographic like having a ring does not imply like Oh I'm a straight man it's like that easily could have been you know bisexual beard had a beard like lwig there's a lot of things you enter the Dark Souls cave and it says KK John that's a different Kirk Johnson that's good that's good this is bad for KK that's not him no that's a guy who studies at y That's he he dude that's like turned it around that's like that picture you know that picture of that like old War General who looks kind of like a nerd and everyone's like this is the baddest [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in the world it's that but it's the goatsy guy he came out of that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in 1997 that's like that Michael Jordan commercial have you seen that 17 people and they're like I'm Michael Jordan and it's all people whose names are Michael Jordan but it's just white chubby be like 40y olds is this commercial yeah was it advertising um I didn't watch the identity theft Michael Jordan honest to God this that'd be a good one then it's Michael Jordan I I protect my identity with UB key Jordan sh brand uh I I would like to welcome back I'm really happy that you're back because we need to get to the heart of a couple matters and one of them welcome to another episode of CRI or cringe CRI or cringe CR it goes on when I it's it's not CRI or cring cring uh those are both bad yeah it is a bad why is it crime no it's good because it's crime or cringe CU crime means like this this is to be punished this is punishable by law and one is no it's just cringe it's just cringe crime or cringe only covers things that are bad to do okay hash out or crash out is will they resolve it or will it ruin them as friend a very different I tol you the what if the case what if the case being litigated is it's it's neither to hear the case to determine if and let's get into it what if it's just about a sophisticated individual Yingling and Aiden are playing CS:GO in the office last night they're playing with the no they're playing actually the fiveman fiveman with some of the orgon guys right we want to get this right Adam of the Adam Smash series ass great biggest local in the country um so when they're playing CSG go Yingling starts yelling at Aiden because I think Aiden actually wasn't in the bu round did you forget to buy uh that would be typical of you for a new reason lwi so or maybe he was late to you know smoke something or basically something in the beginning of the round didn't Happ The Bu button I hear Yingling yell and he's like dude there's no way there's no way you're doing that and I look over Aiden in between the rounds of csgo when he is dead is reading a book at his desk zipper zipper I can throwing up now now as a clown Aiden I do I find that funny God I find that part of my routine that's like a comedy act like you're trying to be hidden for something you pull up a newspaper yeah I didn't I didn't see him Peak I don't know okay looking away from a flash like pulling up a newsp and what happened after that uh well I said I looked over and I'm like there's no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] way you're reading a book he instantly turns he's like what what what's wrong what's wrong it's a good book I'm like that's crazy and he's like it's not that crazy Yingling who is an agent of chaos who who carries no actual opinion about anything he just likes to follow energy he's the Vigilante in every game yeah he he just likes to follow energy he's actually Vibe checking every time and he Yingling is like I know it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] insane and I'm like it is and uh it reminded me of this is at Mayhem years and years ago um the big melee tournament I'm sitting on a setup it's a fourman rotation there's a guy there who every every time he loses and is not on the rotation anymore he has a book face you know opened face down and he would just pick it up and start reading yeah I remember this you told me this and I was like that's insane that is antisocial behavior in a very social game I mean it is no different than if he were to just be browsing YouTube shorts and then miss the buy so oh miss the buy yeah cuz he brows YouTube shorts no no it's different than that because cuz cuz missing the buy is interfering with the video gaming but on a three man rotation they're playing it's it's more of a social FAA yeah yeah it's it's sorry I'm I'm saying you're talking about the CSO thing I was trying to bring up a similar but different distinct uh inance and so we're determining is the book reading crime or cringe for this particular instance of being in a csgo game missing a buy even I I would argue even if you are missing the buy I didn't miss the B I want to add more content usually relate to something but I want to add more cont text the day before that Aiden was playing CS with I think the same group and Aiden starts flaming someone oh he's flaming some counil he's flaming you're playing with Council yes it was Council it was Jacob because because uh they called something was clear and they didn't actually know they didn't they guessed they pulled a guie and he and then I don't know if he ended being punished for it but he Flames them for not knowing right which is which I would say is is you know if you're going to read a book while you play You're missing you are no you are missing information you are arriving late imagine imagine if what he said in that moment was sorry I was reading o he was alive no but well well I mean you're how was the situation not different if you showed up late alive playing the game if you showed up late then for a moment you were alive if I can earlier too while playing CS ah Aiden brought up that he played with the Ukrainian boy small boy small boy boy boy he played with a small Ukrainian boy was a refugee from the war and ukra and he and he said I like the small Ukrainian boy I like y say I like the small Ukrainian no no the young Ukrainian boy said I like your your knife your skins he said yes yes and then you replied it's worth than house no I didn't say that that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up dude is keeping it 99 right now that is's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up I would never say that I have black Air Force Ones of Truth on I could lie Aid he cannot the black Air Force Ones of Truth uh no we we've taken up too much time please first off tell us what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the book is and then I guess it's some book that he's reading for Lemonade Stand must be RI riveting for lemonade it's a riveting non-fiction book about the like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] housing crisis dude you're so close that's so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] funny you you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] clocked me what is it it's a book called abundance by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson Ezra Klein okay it's a and I I don't know I I really am enjoying it obviously a lot yeah you must be this is this is H you have you have 16k in the can't put that thing down guys please please let him crime or cringe himself what do I even get to say what can I even say they've made up their minds no we I'm I'm the decider here and I'm so neutral you're so neutral yeah you just said that I told the Ukrainian kid that my skins were worth more than his house in Ukraine he was such a small boy it was so weird tell cuz he that's what you said I said he would understand the he would understand the value of a house he so small and you're angry at me because I didn't put the f I uh look totally unbiased third party go ahead I I have been really sorry that was bless you I'm sorry it's a nice it's a nice book that just came out and it have to do with housing he's the podcast guy right [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah he's a podcast ain't that that sexual assaulter who was in baby driver and let's go no nope I I was just excit I was enjoying this book so much superhero because usually when I play CS if I'm not super locked in in a game of premere I will during rounds I often Tab out because on my PC setup I have one Monitor and I Tab out to check things like Discord does the ultra wide take up the whole thing uh no my ultra wide is hooked up to my laptop so it's I if I'm on my PC I've had one monitor for a very long time I Tab out to check things sometimes sometimes I am a little late to arounds in comp games which don't matter you know is that true but I'm reading my book I'm reading my book which means that the tab stays up so I'm actually paying more attention than I normally do to when the round ends so we should be you should be I'm just saying compared to we didn't we sorry did we have this conversation three weeks ago when I was tabing out to check Discord between rounds we didn't we we're having it specifically about this book give me full sincerity where did you end where did I on your team uh were you top frag no I wasn't the top were second frag I think I might have been the second frag this changing for me personally I'll tell you what I out fragged Nick Yingling in that game did you that's big news and and the late the missed by quote unquote we were on nuke on te the camera pants heing he's got a book upside down he's looking at it like and when they were complaining about me being late they hadn't even made it from Spawn into Lobby yet but you had no gun that was the issue was it a Buy Round yes and I buy instantly and I'm in the round and I get buy still yeah there's a delay no you can you can buy if you're in the buy Zone I didn't miss the buy again right that's why I was I was clear that it wasn't a Miss Nar so so that that is the circumstance and I and then Anthony I would argue took it a step further because I I can understand imagine imagine you're playing CS with me and you're and you're taking it really really seriously and I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up a roll out or I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up a play because I wasn't listening because I was reading my book during the round I can kind of understand that I can but Anthony's example of reading this guy read the book between games tournament I I said to Anthony that is no different what people do all the time in that situation which is they go on their phone and read Twitter uh look they go on their phone and do the same thing here's what I would say I'm going to make a final judgment cuz I think we it's time to move on what is this I'm saying he's wrong oh I think that uh as the as the clown judge of crime or cringee cringy the clutchy cringy the cringy the crime clowning the crime the crime I do think anony is making a decent comparison here where the playing video game playing Counter-Strike with your friends when you're dead that's the round where you where you enjoy what your teammates are doing and where you make jokes and when you that when you're playing that's when you're highly focused and I think it there's a social element of gaming that's being removed by pulling the book out that is similar to the guy who pulls the book out at the setup uh which I don't I actually you know what I think what Aiden's doing is worse I the guy at the melee setup it's like you know you got [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you got link Peach on the screen I don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] care at the setup it's it's it's actually more likely that you sit down with someone who you don't know and don't have anything to like connect with besides the game which I consider very guys are WR that but I think if you're getting into a five man spending your time with people there is a level of social um alienation that you're opting into you call someone a pedophile up bar so real quick let me chime in here that's fine that's not I that was my friend it's not what are you talking about you can't use the language call your friends with a pedophile Nick Yingling yeah unfortunately calling someone a pedophile is engaging with them my friend I learned the language this is the man that you guys are picking sides with you calling somebody a pedophile is engaging he just said he learned the language if you can that's who you're taking social tips if you can count to 10 in Japanese I side with you it's a crime if you can't I go cringe what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] does that have to do with you just said you learn the language you're just you're just flexing that you know how to count to 10 and it doesn't have to do with I never said you said you learned the language and that's why I said I learned how to say that it's yet in a language you don't know it's like yeah if if a guy doesn't know English but he says hey boy he still said hey boy guy's in America and all he can do is pedophile and that's learn then he's the president uh I would I would say look I think it's cringe I think it's cringe I but it's not a crime it's not a crime of course it's not a crime you think it these the only two options well it's crime or cringe I'm sorry it's not awesome I've given you the best result I let me ask you this is it crime if the he does miss the buy uh yeah yeah yeah if he if it impacted the round like I in my mind I'm separating the book even in a comp game I think the book thing is just like kind of comically lame like sorry boys I was reading like that to he's like wearing suspenders I'm doing what normally might happen which is YouTube shorts and if someone missed the buy because of YouTube shorts I'd be annoyed at though do mean one here I I'll contextualize it for you better imagine we're playing League of Legends normal blind pick together imagine that is that the equivalent yes it is we are playing League of Legends normal blind pick wait I thought you were playing a r I just said comp in CS is normals in leag isn't there normals NCS h no that's what it is in CS that mode is just called competitive it means a casual yes there's a different Premier is R does CH a lot competive exactly that's why I was specifying that that's why I said that's why I said beforehand that if this was Premiere and I needed to be locked in wa but isn't no Premier isn't Premiere outside of no that's face it oh what premier's in the game now PR this is bad for them what was always called right this is a bad branding no they didn't have PR it didn't exist in go premier's inv valerent right Premier is valerant comp prier is inv valerant premere okay in valerant Premier is the tournament mode in CS Premiere is the rank the actual real ranked mode not exis in Counterstrike Global offenses because you had to play face it face it still exists but now CS2 has Premiere Premier is the compet like the using the term like as an adjective competitive ranked mode in CS you can't get a rank and competitive you can be in the same way you but nobody cares nobody cares about that is it a separate rank because there's no way to play like like there's not really I guess there technically is a way to play even more casually than that where but it changes the format of the game you can play like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 10 V10 like it's like Flex Q then in League it is it's not even like Flex it's it's like I would you know what I I'll be generous it's like normal draft pick it's like normal draft pick you know what you learned all that in your book yours I will say because because we had a stack that was too far away in Elo together to Q Premiere so we just played for fun okay I'll say this I think that does change it for me oh interesting it's interesting that you didn't have all the cont that you didn't have you got it's it's called comp don't make grg tusla come out play CS for hundreds of hours you know I've never played CS2 hey you need this you didn't know this either you're a clown you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bald you're bald also I have hair so okay do you understand my confusion a little bit yes cuz in my it's just like it's just surprising that it's confusing because you have played a lot of Counter Strike in Counter Strike I just called it ranked I don't know man I I have [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what it does change things it's undebatably funny to read a book while playing Counter-Strike in any circumstances we all agree on we are all there that is just hilarious to do Aiden is an alien but if someone's watching YouTube shorts during a normal draft League game I'm not I can't it's like whatever it's like whatever I would that was my that was my point your teammate if your teammate was reading a book or checking Discord in this normal draft pick game and then they had been alive for five seconds and hadn't bought their new items and got them back to Lane yet how big of a deal is that me like okay let's flip it on you you're playing and all four of your teammates are watching porn and jerking on okay grun it is it is it still the same teammates is it Adam Yingling it's all the same teammates including just to be clear not the Ukrainian child Weir that you brought that up Yingling doing this in the call would be funny cuz he sits behind Aiden yeah so he would simp off behind looking at me you would hear him and he's also reading to do it okay okay how about this do you are you happy are you happy that's happening that's all I'm asking are you pumped am I

because he he asked he asked all of us I think we it was like you asked your closest friends isn't this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up the blood CL you ask Aiden for one he literally doesn't send even then I chastise him he still didn't make one you asked me for one I sent it to you like the next day you didn't ask Nick for one ended up being guilted to ask him for one and then he did send it to you which was mostly comethazine so during the trip me and Michael would listen to Spotify during the ride cuz probably 100 plus hours just on that bike and that gets us through a lot of it but you need music you need music so we were listening to music and I I thought it' be fun to ask friends to play this so I asked a bunch of people I asked probably like TW uh like four people I not that many people I asked so few people so few people shroud yeah I asked 12 I think you hung out with shroud in real life like three times so memorable I asked a bunch of people for like to our playlists that I could listen to on the ride cuz I thought you know I we have our playlists so the list of people I asked I can run through I asked I asked slime I asked Aiden right uh I asked my sister yeah uh SK one Cutie uh I asked shroud shoud poke man um fley yeah good friends Lily Pichu uh Alex Alex smokes smokes mid yeah wow so you were listening some two just yeah a lot a lot actually of two uh who else did I I asked a few other people I can't remember off top but anyway that that was it'sall oh cool you have some some music that sounds of manne French music so you didn't uh you didn't you didn't ask me you didn't ask clutchy the that's not true you didn't I didn't ask you initially which is not asking me if I never messaged you you never would have asked me I didn't ask you ini you don't know didn't get to find out why did you go so deep huh cuz he just disproved my whole Theory which was oh I'm probably low on his DM stack you guys messed him so recently I had M you at the top of the DM stack shroud is pretty low on your stack he must be oh yeah I had to look up his name I had to look up most of these people I think I looked up everyone's name he's just burying the steak I don't have my phone not that but he's also burying it Nick did send me a message come on of uh of I don't know maybe some anger uh of not that could be it too is that how you interpret when people are hurt with you is that they must be angry that well that's what hurt leads to F have you not watched sure Star Wars Episode Two okay right yeah yeah yeah look at me look at me I was hurt please put it back on put it back on Hon Kong yeah uh Nick was hurt uh and I was like I was like a dude my bad which didn't work name one song on the playlist I sent you uh it starts with uh the gorillas I believe it starts with the gorillas is that not the band's name do it start with that I think so yeah it's gorillas by the gorillas no I forget the song name but it's like the one on the album gorillas it's like the gorillas song I don't know okay to be clear when you're riding a motorcycle what you don't get to do is be like that was a banger this is a good point the name of the song is in the chorus that also isn't helpful cuz you don't know that when you're listening it's pretty famous song is it is it the one that I danc to at seventh grade dance yeah I think so no well how do you know I don't think I'm old he's old grade Anyway by the way I B the I don't know why I saw my dick cuz I binked the first song in the band I just don't know the name of it I binked the band you binked the first song in the list which asked that which makes me think that he only asked for one song from the song you naming the first one makes it feel like but again I can only you also named a band that's on the cover photo this this is dude true oh WR your face lwi I think an important social context to this is that when I met Gren and Riley from hive mind for the first time they put together a big playlist of their favorite songs of all time that I listened to a bunch and they asked me grden asked me which song I enjoyed the most from the playlist and I was about to say a song at the beginning of the playlist that is actually my favorite song but then I intentionally switched it to one in the middle that's clean so that he would understand that I didn't just listen to like the first two songs can't do because lwi doesn't know any in the middle I do know what they sound like but I was driving a motorcycle did you okay I couldn't tell you anyone's middle songs unless I knew the song did you like the playlists yeah who is your favorite playlist well before we get there Nick messaged me hurt and I said send me a playlist he's like no I'm play this now and then I sent him a picture I was like please he still like no and then I saw another picture I was like please guess and then and then he's like fine he I'm so freaking sorry and then you said I guess I'm just freaking sorry I think I said this face and I went I'm so freaking sorry I'm freaking sorry and then he sent me a playlist which was called uh uh only listen to playlist if you are a pedophile yeah do you have it still the picture uh oh my my phone's under the costume yeah my phone's gone too but it was basically a playlist called it was like it was like I listen to this playlist because I'm a pedophile and also I have a bomb and in the description it said in this airport and then I sent all the playlists to Michael so he also listen to the pedophile playlist so we're locked in on that twin uh anyway yeah I listen to all the playlists and I and I know my favorite ones in my head okay I would love to hear did you put all the playlists into one playlist or did you just go through them I would like we had I would section rides okay so like maybe morning be like so top three anything not top three doesn't matter top ordered top three and start at three I would go number three my sisters okay h family she knows your taste maybe she knows my taste she had a bunch of hits in there that growing up yeah uh number two pokem man oh it's cool Banger playlist I'm looking through what I sent you it's so fire uh just the rock band one track number one the best one by far was the playlist me and Michael crafted good play you guys crafted a playlist guy who listens to music yeah we did like a like a Japan sort of together it was like a riding playlist yeah that's crazy had a bunch of masio how do you think like mine would have done oh my God I think yours do you like newj bees that's the question that's all you need to ask you do I do and he's got me by the balls there fine bro whatever well no lot [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a dick a lot of playlists hurt off the fact that uh they're way hard to listen to while riding a motorcycle so like uh F's playlist was tough why what you have a bunch of like Sad Girl music which is fine is it because you is it because of the vibe or because it's you can't hear because of like you can't hear the wind's ripping I picked my songs based on whether or not I thought they'd be nice to listen to while wind's flowing through your hair on a motorcycle no way all my songs I thought about that dude and if we had a top four [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you would be in it I don't I'm four you would be in it top [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] chuckle and chuckle [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] wait so you're definitely above Chuck it cuz I was working hard for you I say I picked my songs for him I I was like these are songs that are important to me and if lewick would like to get to know me better through the things I like these are the songs I would choose I could tell I I said I said that's nice that sounds nice when you say I I I picked these are the parts of me I think lwig would like yeah interesting mine were like I was also like I I didn't choose any thing that I think he would think sucked I was like maybe he would like this um but yeah look look I appr never made a playlist before and to be clear I appreciate all the playlist and I listen to all of them I'm never doing this again that's fine I have your playlist forever now I don't need it again your taste will never change that's not true I love two Hollis you you'll still love him when you're 44 yeah but I'll also love three Hollis whever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] comes out whatever the sequel uh yeah the only uh the only playlists cuz they're all good CU last place no is last per se you said shroud had school shooter music you said that he did you put the first song on shroud's sale dude I can't imagine that I can't imagine what he listens to uh we did say shroud had some school shooter music he's got Dark Twisted thoughts I feel like he's got like Limp Biscuit Lincoln Park uh Green Day American Idiot bro it's like lowkey no no it's way less what do school shooter Meed to you uh Lincoln Park Green Day I feel like I would I would have thought like maybe he was sending you like asop rock cerebral hip-hop dude why is it so funny to imagine trout listening to anything and it's just a funny it was the Wicked musical in order though which was weird dude um Nick's mom and Nick's girlfriend were they like I don't know who assigned them this task was it you uh it's just my mom but she she it's it was me and Aiden she's helping basically spruce up the place Nick's mom has become a slave and whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa let's stop there I would say she's adding a if I'm being honest touch a woman to the place yes that's how I describe it yes because yesterday someone left a dump in the toilet again happened another crime again another crime Place could use a woman's touch was it we don't know we tried to we literally like Spider-Man pointing at each other like I didn't go downstairs you didn't go downstairs dis closure I actually thought it was me at first I was like did I just like forget to flush the toilet but then I walk through i i t I just recently gone down to pee in the same bathroom was it our was it our was it our number one suspect uh miles no it couldn't have been miles 31 years old okay I think I think I could smell I think I could smell all three of your poops and know who's

[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] RuneScape imp Kelby is so close to quitting because of him that's crazy because he's here every day and he just sits on he lays on the couch or sits at the desk and harasses Kelby and I do not know how Kelby Kelby is breaking that's crazy you are lying for Content no I'm not I I if I ever heard and I and cuz I doubt it's I I like to imagine Kelby finds some Joy me and Kelby have long conversations in private that's weird why is it weird oh I guess I can't have a bald friend who's 40 you're always [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stepping on my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 36 36 and almost 37 that's awesome uh I if he ever said to me slime was disrupting my work I would lock the doors yeah I would just open them with a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crowbar you can't stop me the day the other day L we were here and I think it was actually yesterday and uh slime orders food okay but instead of ordering food to the office well cuz he's here he accidentally orders it home oh and it's like it's like oi it like a $50 meal so so he it was $50 45 of it the fees and taxes and delivery and and he's he's here and he goes [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I ordered my food five food to my house [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and we're all like oh okay so you going to like go home he's like I don't know what to do and we're like okay what do you want to do he's like I don't know he did that for like what an hour and a half he I don't know what to do sent me a picture of it I was pissed full time Alex Alex is here and Alex is mercilessly making fun of him he's like dude you order the just get off your ass and go drive he's as he'll be like just go get some food dude just go like hang out just talk a human being dude shut the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up Alex is trying to shame him for using U and and and slime is just like what do I do he's like what should I order it again here like any of us [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] care what he does he's just looking at the it's he's looking so upset W for one person to tell you he's looking at the six other people in the room so finally waiting valid waiting for one person to sign off on him reordering which is a bad idea you don't re and then after like 40 minutes I quietly said to him I said no I asked you I said Aiden let me paint you a picture and I described my situation very very cleverly disguised as somebody else and I said I said what if you ordered food one day you hanging out all your friends and stuff and I and I and I carefully he's probably you're probably mind blown right now carefully explain the situation in a metaphor and then I said would you order again or would you go home to get this uh food this burrito like whatever it is and Aiden said I might order again and so then you ordered again and that's all I needed to he needed one person I really needed to hear that dude here's the thing it's like you know what's funny I came home late 2 a.m. ate some of it cuz it was still there that's not funny dude how long was it there like hours I don't know [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we joking that like the ants were like they were Alex was like they're going to individually carry grains of rice back back to their to their home come back from [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] neone with no phone none of this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I can't even [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] relate I woked when you left I I I started I deleted Uber Eats and door dash off my phone I started mixing like making food at home and getting food out but not never ordering I started working out three times a week what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happened why I've be getting my protein and my and I've been dieting pretty well love that no sugar for 3 weeks now I love we're the same I I I I got crazy and and I played elen ring are we like stopping you from having a better life it wasn't because you left but I'm real I just got better when you left you guys all I was I got better I don't know what that means so this goes back to what I was saying earlier is y all changed when I left yeah I definitely CH for the better you became a normie what can I can I speak my piece really quick on Uber can you honk first honk thank you uh uh I okay so I was we had a shoot today and I was uh there's a there's a there's a like it's like a boutique bagel place called wake and late in Downtown LA and on my way they good bagel it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up this place is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up and the thing that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up about it is they have a The Bagel is insanely priced it's like one Bagel is like I think it's like $8 like it's ridiculous and they make you this is the F the minimum order quantity wait what did you say don't convert it he said it's like 1300 the minimum order quantity is two bag so much for a p you can order one Bagel at this place so 2600 y right exactly very good um you have to order two Bagels so you were spending a minimum of like $16 when you go instead of every other bagel place it's like four bucks and you get a bagel like a buttered Bagel normal yeah and I'm on my way there and I'm like I try I try to never go to this place if I'm alone because it's such a waste of money to just get two bagels and I'm not going to eat both of them and it's like then I have to go find usually I try to find someone in my day like hey do you want a bagel like I have one they're like no I'm like okay whatever but I I was late to this shoot and I'm like I got to I'm here I'm going to I'm going to order I I and it's a day they're very very busy on weekends I know that but I'm like whatever it'll be fine I'll order it ahead of time order it ahead of time get there it's the busiest I've ever seen this like this place by a lot there's like there's maybe no exaggeration there's maybe 60 people who are in the restaurant and 40 of them are crowded around the pickup zone it's looking like ass waiting for waiting for their order get a weekly in there and I I it it was like I'm I'm coining a new pH it's like the fent lean of Uber Eats drivers they were all standing around the desk and they were if a if a if an employee even came close to them they would by Instinct it's like their phone here we go they'd go like this they'd go and they're not even getting looked at it's that they can't control it they're like look at my phone I need my order and no one's getting attention so all of them and S and thinking they're just putting their phones like this and no one's looking at them it was crazy I'm like they just can't control it and they're just doing and I was like this is dark I'm like what I'm really watching I'm just watching people do their job one of them is chewing out one of them is like I've been for 45 [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] minutes where's my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] order and an Asian woman next to him is going and no and n and no the is just like and you know what else is on the other side of this what's that 45 people sitting their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] home on sitting ass and deal SP $30 about to deliver to the wrong address jerking off the I got this very raw perspective on it where I was like all right the lazy person's at home that's the person I would normally say is Despicable but there's like a second person here who's like which I get they're just doing their job and they're probably frustrated because they're not able to go to another order because they're waiting that's their job they're making less money right but so they're but they're so they're like zombies they're they're stepping in front of the people who have just ordered to go normal nor and they're like showing their phone like I had to wait for like seven people to show their phone to say hey is my order ready and I was like whatever I'll wait I'll wait for all this madness it's whatever then it got to a point where I was like uh I asked I finally got to ask like oh is mine ready and they're like oh it's going be another 30 minutes I said oh okay just cancel my order it's all good I'll just leave I just won't eat here but it gave me this this doomsday look on Uber eat that I had had at all level cuz cuz part part of why I think the bagel is $8 is because of the sheer quantity being sold on the apps it raises well it's just a simple supp and I'm like I I'm like why why too minimum why so expensive for a bagel but then there's all this demand that's just making the experience terrible the cost terrible there's a limited Supply how many bagels can you reliably make a day I was like this is gross so you the employees are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] miserable yeah no one is winning no except the guy at home spending $30 guyn is the guy who owns The Bagel Shop the guy who owns The Bagel Shop who is probably not there and Rocket money just Raks it in they just rake it in they got all you got your unwanted subscription come by come get our app come get our app it goes even higher than

skin mask it's Shake drizzle what are we done why why would Shake drizzle make his life easy no cuz he couldn't get [Laughter] Michael Michael sign Shake isn't slept in a week cuz he's also editing overnight has to edit that's how he knows the good parts to put in brother I was in it as much as anyone else man I was in that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I will say the moment I came back I relapsed last night I was browsing YouTube shorts until 3:00 a.m. to the point where cutie said just stop she was like trying to sleep she's like stop with the video and I was like I need to catch up Ashton Hall just dropped asht looing your shorts the day you guys see this Ashton Hall thing yeah isn't that funny crazy it's crazy too much so much Saratoga it's so much Saratoga other that replied Lord Almighty I know he talk [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on Han finally I can agree with him but but Assan chopped it up with viven it's true and that probably got him back [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dude yeah I uh but now I'm going now I'm going back you're going full back full back for day Burger lwi I realized for a day and now I'm going to go back check out my eler ring video first though you're going to go back I watched your Elden ring video no we didn't finish it nope but I opened it and watched a bit of it and then you left YouTube and went to Facebook and then went to Twitter went to any other website and hurt me in the algorithm yes can you uh zipper can you I sent you a a picture a couple weeks ago that I we didn't bring up on the Pod but I think it's perfectly appropriate now it's in your DMs how do you like Elden ring I feel like you'd be bad at the game I mean my G you said the same [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] no I just like when you say [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I think I am my guess I don't know a lot about Elden ring mly Ling please I think I am um I think I am above average mechanically and far below average in uh like yeah I'm rightwing business but left wi for like social exploratory understanding you should read abundance it's c yeah you just haven't played a lot of single player games so like that piece of your brain isn't tuned I've played a lot of single player games I haven't played any like this do you have a death counter do I have a death counter yeah in the YouTube video not in the Stream Yeah Tim sent me a clip of you fighting godri yeah godri he falls off the damn fall the damn [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Ed that was like an hour and a half in he wants to oh yeah uh this is dude that's a oh my God this was actually taken out of basketball game this is a picture of me of course it is yeah I'm glad you can it's we that you immediately recognize yourself I why this is why the the gibli filter is wrong because an artist could have done this no no no no this is a photograph what I thought it was AI art I knew it was me cuz of the head shape this is this is this is Burger augen bro Burger [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a on the basketball it's got to be I paid him to do this you paid him for this yeah dude this is funny just pay artists they'll deliver this is what we were talking about through the Japan trip Dan kept saying he's like what if what if at the end of the trip Michael's all rugged and he's growing a beard and you're just 300 lb he kept saying that I was like what do you mean like why did that happen D's losing his mind wouldn't it be funny you're 300 lounds and Michael just looks like he's been on an adventure is there is there anything you can give us about the trip anything crazy uh uh the only thing I can say is what we were going to do and I'm so happy we didn't do I don't know because you know our original idea right what South North tip no you have to like work for the money yeah like so yeah yeah I'm so happy with what we ended up doing what I I don't think I've said it but what we were initially were going to do was traveling across Japan on$ dollar and that we were going to go starting at the North to the South and you wanted to work for your money right we had to work for our money and gas food [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] gas food you're going to become ladies of the night real quick you're going to go through that red light district you're to they would they would pay top dollars oh my God they me and it's not cheating no I'm working honey exactly I'm working Mone I'm working for us yeah I uh I'm so happy we didn't do that cuz I think what we did w is way better like cuz you don't have to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] be in the struggle which could be like laring too broke yeah uh we also still struggle but the resolution is like interacting with people not like working or trying to find work or annoying people asking for work uh and then also one big thing we changed is we initially we going to go north to south but which would have been a huge [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mistake why cuz Hokkaido was so hard the last three days of this trip were brutal it was like the worst motorcycle riding I've ever experienced Al it would have been like really tough right at the start yeah and then like really easy at the end it would have been no it would been like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] journey to Mordor we're starting at Mordor and we're going [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Hobbit Place yeah and then you just end up at the sh yeah and it's like yeah it was actually nice at the end this is great I love this walk yeah it's better for the resolution yeah so those changes were [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] excellent we all supposed to do one more thing because Michael really wanted to Camp so he wanted to do a daily cap we we had come to this idea cap what is this MOG mail sorry let's go let's go keep talking [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that was good it's Hong Kong funny had a daily cap we had a daily limit of $100 we could spend is what we were going to do yeah yeah which would be enough for like gas and food and maybe somewhere to stay but and then oh I'm hitting up the the I'm hitting up the place with the big red dildo out front I'm buying like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] big like uh like latex ass put putting it on the front of the bike I'm oh my God I'm and I'm hitting it while I ride and so yeah yeah instead of on the back of the bike too I like that at least one of my hundreds one of my hunds and I'm likea buy me lunch bro money limit make you do that food is so cheap there 100 bucks oh my God Michael buy me but like why would a limit make you buy the ass cuz the money cu the money's free the money's valuable too like it's like right it's like it's like cool that it can't all be for my sustainability of life I didn't eat all day so I put an ass on my bike that's kind of cool we ended up not we we literally started with that we were going to do it and I said it in an initial like intro and then cuz we thought or I thought that doing the journey would be really easy I like oh I know the city they'll just figure out where to go yeah and then day one we failed day one we were like we're getting rid of the budget whatever this hotel is we're the first hotel we are at we are staying at I don't care if it's over budget I think it technically was under budget but that makes so much more sense why the intro was filmed cuz you could tell that the intro was filmed like later on in the trip like four I had to do like vo for it yeah what does this say uh probably Super Monkey nope I can't I read it you're not wait it literally does Super Monkey it's literally say it says you're a cuck it does it just it says Super Monkey all chatter with this one that's what it says all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] chatter with this tell uh I was we were talking with Alex the other day or yesterday about like old Justin TV and how it became twitch and I was explaining to him that the old site I used to watch DOTA on it was either own 3D TV or owned TV or a daily motion and he's like oh and he's really interested and then 4 seconds later he's like Daily Motion is an awesome name I'm like yeah I didn't really think about that they Ahad of time we should we should bring it back Daily Motion had no idea what they had they had no idea I was like what an awesome twitch name sitting on a sick URL uh yeah the the FL home I got sad that I couldn't use my Japanese anymore really you still can call up your sex pest Ukrainian Japanese teacher have some awesome conversation about AR but not even for learning just like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] binking a conversation and feeling like I get plus one stealth how much do you feel like you improved in the time you were there I think CU I imagine a good bit it was like I got really good at saying what I know how to say but I've learned almost nothing new cuz we couldn't look [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up you probably learned like slightly better words for like road and travel to and Challenge and I like if I'm talking about traveling places I'm like 100% confidence I could communicate what I'm trying to get across but like I don't know how to say Tuesday right yeah yeah I don't know that one balls and butthole oh could say um did you just throw an ore in there that's what I I thought you were supposed to do that I thought you just threw an English or no no all all kurasai so I'm ordering your balls and butthole at a restaurant and on a dish and that fried if if I could he's saying he saying Bon butthole please yeah I did have some of my worst conversations towards the end of the trip too like you were just bad performing in them or or they were beat ass people there was one I was SP too much some talk some bus you just like you're talking to some chub on the trip was he gone for CH yeah he missed the whole [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he watched a video he watched a video oh you watched yeah I watched a video he liked that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] V he probably he probably oh that video I thought him at the yard he probably cut out halfway I lived in it he lived Among The Cho Tu no he did uh the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I had one conversation with this dude is's really cool and and but I the way me and Michael generally operate in a conversation is I lead and I'm tanking early and then he'll come in with like a few phrases that he knows that are his Specialties uh but I was tanking so much in this conversation at a certain point he kind of turned around cuz Michael said a line he's like oh you speak Japanese and Michael's like a little bit and then every time he'd ask a question he would turn to ask Michael the question yeah and then we would both reply like normal but he would always do that and then there was a point where we were like at a hotel and I went to check in he was waiting for us outside side and uh and he's with Michael and he's he tell he told Michael he's like you should go in cuz you speak Japanese just getting mogged and I'm and I'm like bro I've done every check-in I've done every single one I don't know why you're doing this to me wow Hur we need some friends here who speak Japanese you keep using it yeah it is not as fun to use here did you see the I couldn't even use on the airplane here I felt too embarrassed no yeah the air ride cuz the lady just spoke perfect English so it's just weird for me how I to slow down the conversation the last few times I've flown to Sweden I try to S like just talk in Swedish but it does feel that's such poser [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's such poser [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bro cuz you're on a plane home huh you're on a plane home what are you talking what about the plane playing there you speak some Swedish what cuz you're on the way what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you talking the American flight attendants no they're not American Scandinavian Airlines km right Scandinavian think the rule should be on the way there you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you talk your heart out in a foreign language on the way home Burger Time the way there I spoke English and the way back I spoke English because they clearly are just perfectly bilingual and me speaking Japanese is just slowing down their service yeah it feels more uncomfortable when you know they can speak they also initiate English you make them change only on the way there I I would have to say sorry can you speak Japanese that'd be sick and then you like suck at it me on Scandinavian Airlines
