 hi slime how's your day going and then he goes some snarky remark about how I do nothing for the company and then I go you don't have a [Music] job real jazz music I got that lunch Le and feast of balls I got that no I was going to say I got some YouTubers I can call I oh now we're going oh we weren't even going yet we weren even going save that we weren't even going yet should I say it again yeah you can say it again I got that Lely inas what is that a spoof of oh come on dude I'm sorry you don't know that song is it DJ got I got that good cushion alcohol oh I didn't know that the you know what's funny I've only ever heard that spoken you've just been around a lot of people who want the good Al speak about what they're they're on that but they're not singing it long as Mr Beast loves me I was thinking about becoming the next ebi wow you guys think this is a good idea well no cuz you're Greek so you're already off to a terrible start wow that is so intolerant okay so because he's Greek he can't have the job he wants are you saying that's crazy famously unemployed the Greeks are you saying that because of my Heritage yeah I can't achieve my dreams I think that's what I'm saying for real want move to Sweden guy who wants to move to Sweden I don't think you should do something like that's not your Birthright no you don't not your blood job because the government pays you money the government pays you and it's not your bloodline haven't worked 20 days I just play Counter Strike you can't you can't be in fortnite if you're Greek they they send someone to behead there has to be at least one Greek character in fortnite is Dr Doom Greek uh I don't think so maybe okay zipper what ethnicity is Dr Doom from the comics uh but yeah I think I was thinking about this I think I can make it happen I just have to I already speak kind of some good Spanish yeah and I can capture the South American audience right and I love soccer famously so and they all call it soccer and I know what you guys are thinking Rani That's So Close oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] look I know what you guys are thinking out there it's like oh empty L we share and your mouse is like slowly going up to click out of the episode well I had an idea just make them not click click out don't click out Archie has hit a single frame of a Chipotle gift card in this episode and it's actually real it's real it's in there you got to look for it so you know you're probably already too late if you're listening to this realistically statistically statistically what probably happen there's maybe another one someone heard the audio version of this and they said I'm camping out the release yeah it's a it's a miscellaneous amount of money it could be a lot could be a little but it will buy you one burrito it'd be so crazy cuz if you spent the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 2 hours it might take you to find the frame in this video you could have just gone and modal no no no you could speed it up like I bet there's an AI that can do this function specifically kids are Drop Shipping now dude this is third monitor when they get this yeah you don't get it dude we're not even second monitor anymore are you kidding me God we're on the vertical monitor we are boxed into a half of a vertical I'm on the same Corner as like a monitor that is mostly mostly Alibaba mostly Alibaba we're on the corner of the Discord monitor that's like in in in the 9,000 servers you're in oh great kiddo you're uh you're in a a furry roleplay server that's great I'm looking let everyone look down at their Discord Oh e wait hold on yeah get that oh you have an nsw Channel dudee gross she's nuzzling your neck dude my what are you going to reply you put a Tales around the words you need to get out you need to go outside dude K did a number on your little brain didn't it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's right so there's some free Chipotle in this episode so you know think again before you click away with also non-sponsored and to prove it uh Chipotle has human feces and every bit of meat that they serve yes that's and that's a Chipotle promise that's the Chipotle promise and that's why I eat cold Factor me no no no that's good bro all all right I just you know [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm sick what you sick D you know he didn't think about us we just about the paramotor and he he posted a video did you see his voot paragliding I hate this everyone is tagging me everyone is in my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dude he's parag he's doing the thing it's gliding it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] different you're an idiot he's going to die yeah we're all going to die I saw there was no motor he's still going to die we're going to be out of a job he literally didn't we wouldn't be out of a job we' be out of a job we've proved that we can be funny without him which is the only does uh uh how high does paragliding go high as the mountain is brother really think about that so I mean it seems like it's as dangerous as paramotoring parting is not as dangerous because you are you eventually will just land paramotoring is dangerous cuz if the mechanics fail you fall out of the sky but if the mechanics fail don't you still have upwind can't you just like but if you're hold on if you're par when you paramotor aren't don't you still have like a parachute thing about yeah that's my yeah well then why didn't that guy who fell out of the sky just use his parachute yeah like why was he grav are you saying are you trying to say there's no paragliding accidents can I I'm not obviously can I see a picture of a par you also can I bring up a picture of a paramotor uh i m machine zipper thank you I want to see what the machine looks like and if it has some sort of thing on it is it just a big fan what has a higher what it Pi remember no they're holding on to a a a thing I think you got something you got like a parachute thing above you and then the motor is strapped behind you yeah right [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's a paramotor yeah dude it's in his hand no no no no no no it's he's holding the one yeah dude what are you talking about you look at am I am I crazy can we see footage this this Pages 20 says build and fly a paramotor safely yeah you have like a pack and then and then you have the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] thing that helps FL they land they have all those [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] strings I've watched them fly they have like all these yeah I think that I don't know man it's basically the same I don't think it except it's slow slow he what lwi is doing is slow you got to detach from the fan if it fails I play like a rocket ship window I pilot Wing 64 and that is a par yeah thank you zipper if you could BL bring up that that's a paraglide and that is different I've played Superman 64 and you just kind of you try to go through the Rings you think he was trying to go through them damn Rings just and and there's nothing else but the Rings can we do some quick math can you look up param morar param Mor param param morar that would be a good idea that L's actually not coming back if that's what it is one of those subconscious genius ideas like one of those kind of like you have to be born with like a brain like mine type ideas and you could like have a concert in the sky like fortnite Haley Williams flying through the air and she's the paramotor instructor and you are the the novice oh and she's teaching me that that guess what sweetheart that you're a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] whoa we're on a param motor you're a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and nothing more and I say thank you Haley she probably that song when she was 17 I know she actually regrets she's talked about that she's like I regret it yeah she doesn't say the line anymore she doesn't say the line anymore cuz [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] shaming is bad what does she say now she says uh eat at chili and eat a chili she's a Southwest egg rolls are half off right now um paramotor deaths are there a year and then I want to see the math per capita all right I want to know how likely it is my friend comes back from this trip bro he's already done it's not like like what are posting postum pictures right now I like the idea that lwig perishes in a paragliding accident they keep posting pictures of him that they took earlier to be like hey I'm good like a fake Conor Connor's in the RV he's like we need a way to salvage The Vibes like we need to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] make sure this stream still pops and they just 1.3 paramotor deaths per year that's great so there's two call it two it's so safe it's safer than normal flying and how many paragliding deaths are there these numbers aren't don't they cuz like probably more people paraglide by a lot data always gives uh half the the info yeah that's over 17 years um 23 people have died yeah and then paragliding deaths these are like it's funny because like paramotoring 21% of these deaths were due to Drowning you just dude I went swimming with a big fan you just tanking it into the water and then [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and then drowning because the metal is dragging you down this pisses me off cuz what this means that hover boats aren't real cuz hover boats operate on the same logic of a giant fan wait wait wait wait why would they not be wait wait wait wait wait wait body contact with spinning propeller has you skipped over power plant equipment malfunction as the second biggest reason that there's paramotor accidents are you involved in this wait what does that mean that just means they're going into power lines bro no but why is the equipment malfunctioning is that mean why would say equipment then I don't know I think maybe this is like this is dead internet bro robot wrote guys who are trying to fly into like a nuclear power plant for superpowers they try to fly into the big cylinder yeah oh we got another one go in it it's all Concrete in there they think it's big green goop it's really think it's like Mario's to no it's actually guys it's just steam it's just steam it's just hot water doesn't driving into the hot water cylinder and just scalding your face bones off parag and screaming paragliding accidents probably a lot more popular also because I keep asking for paragliding accidents he keeps highlighting a different pair of Motoring thing well he wants us to see he's trying to educate us then he closes the screen slime so what's that he always closes the screen I don't know why he loves the black screen so the loudest I want to I want to talk to him about it I like what what makes you feel Comfort here z may maybe the last yard episode will be just all of our grievances we'll sit him in a chair he can't talk it'll piss everyone off and we'll just air it all out they say listen listen zip yeah look here here's the thing about lwig I I've sent him a couple messages here and there I asked him I asked him actually a pretty important question about the Beday business which took him forever to get I had to tag him and I said uh okay wait this is par paragliding uh one 10 1,000 per year we'd have to know how many people actually 10.8 injuries per 1,000 participants per year fatality of0 46 per 100,000 flights that's 46 deaths a year wait so it's like what one in every one in every 200,000 people die it actually is much safer then fly yeah is it yeah because it said the the other one that what it said there were there were like double digits death per year but there weren't that many like flights or participants most accidents occur during takeoff and Landing I think that's a cheeky way to say crashing into the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ground by the way cuz they're all Landing if you if you die if you die paragliding and takeoff just F just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's on you yeah come on man that's on you what do you do so I messaged lwig and I was like um I I said do you ever use the Beday too harshly and you get the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] from your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] onto the back of your balls and have to Wi wipe the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] from your balls and then he didn't reply in a minute and so I attacked him and I said lwig and I said at lwig yeah and then he didn't reply in another minute so I so I Googled time and Japan and screenshotted it to make sure I knew that the time in Japan was appro like realis make sure he knew that it was 4:46 p.m. and then he finally replies and says no and I replied with a cap Emoji so this is the kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm dealing with there's there's P I don't think he's going to come back from Japan no he's of course he's coming back do you think he's over there and like and like he's with like Connor and who else is who else is he with right now he's with like Chris Broad and they're sitting around and he's like walking up all scared like a dog and he's like hey guys sorry I didn't reply earlier and they're like oh dude L it's all good no no because it's all good man car dealt with this let's go get some Ramen and some delicious [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fish that looks like it's from a cartoon and you eat it we'll be in the beautiful countryside I know what you're saying but th he pisses other people off too and that's what makes me feel validated you saw one clip of Conor being kind of frustrated was his face and no Conor was not kind of he was just like dude and then he's going to say what's up baby and it's not going to feel good and then and dude it was and I was like it's fine he he does this to everyone so I don't have to feel bad I think that they are easygoing though because you kind of have to be cuz they're also content creator like demons right they got evil worms in their head I think they have I think they have the Japanese Hospitality yeah so they so they're extremely nice to him but then extremely infuriated in their mind yes but they but they can't release it yeah yeah and they go to where they pay for time in like a room where you can break a computer in the smash room yeah I want to see Conor Matt I want to see him at his wits end I want to see everything I've been saying Lux voice lines CU it's funny to me that's great D I want to see everything I don't like this era for you really are you kind of built to be a riot games guy why cuz dude I played two yeah but when when you two main on when you played valerant you would just like you said in chat the other day you should run to me when someone was being annoying in chat you you like kind that one's kind of an Alex you like you like that characterization I like I do think it's funny I like when when Cipher takes his hat off and he's bald yeah and he looks like a grape you like Tom kench dud you like everything you like Tom kenchin cyer you called me two nights ago and she was like uh she was like basically asking if they can use the yard set to record something and I was like yeah I don't care and uh and she was like really really really grateful for this yes which I felt was very easy to make I didn't think I really went out of my way to do anything um and then last night she calls me again and she she's like she starts the call she's like yeah so I just got a phone with lwig and I was telling him how nice it is that like you are letting us use the yard say it's like so sweet and so endearing and and I I couldn't believe it he was so I was like talking you up so big um I was wondering if we could use it more and I was like okay well I'll kind of erase all the good favor you've built up of me if I say no right and she's like oh I realized that's extremely manipulative I'm so s i not what I was doing and she tries to like walk it all back and I'm like no it's all good I see your strategy but you can use it wait wait what is what are they doing buttering butter Nick up I'm curious now it is funny though because it is it is so low lift in the sense it's like yeah it's like I just you know I just won't be here I'm I'm on my phone like this I'm like yeah sure but she's like I'm just so grateful and I'm like yeah yeah I want to say no for the sport no I I think you won't I didn't get a call that's so I got a text I got a text so you need approval so that's kind of she Dam Zipper at 2:30 a.m. about that's time to go to the dentist so I'm going to be like no I'll tell her no and we'll just see what she does do you think this is a good idea yeah yeah just DM her and say I heard your request you need board approval I am onethird of the board how can I how can I fence it this situation I'll just like I'm a little iffy on it but uh I'm ultimately okay try to get like a snack out of it oh like I'll say yes for a snack I could be bought Kitty I would like you to bake me cookies I want I Wafers I want to borrow your dog I want to borrow your dog for a week I want to hold your dog up while it shits on your floor I want to squeeze the poop out of your dog I want to feel like I'm doing it I won't need to squeeze that hard I know this from experience I know this from experience your dog poops very easily there's a button it's like it's like toothpaste coming out there a button under the fur it kind of comes out like a like you your dog has other features it runs on Ubuntu she's your Ubuntu Swift I can tap into the Chip And I can make your dog do tricks like back flips and screaming like a man I want to make auto type code in your dog how does that make you feel Can I code your dog let me code your dog let's make a thing on the set where they when they sit down it a trapo unleashes I'm going to make a I'm going to code the dog instead of Chasing Cars it chases Bitcoin I'm going to and it gets me a bunch of Bitcoin I'm going to co oh dude I'm going to code your dog to get me a bag yeah dude cuz [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it cuz they talking treats Aiden I'm just talking about money let's make it let's make them fall down a pit Aiden the dog bit's still gone we used to we used to you reminded me cuz the trapo do you do you think the people that live in that house now have gotten injured from the set do you think they use this I don't I think about that sometimes why would they get injured it's just a ladder well you can climb a ladder and then maybe fall down like there already a ladder having a ladder in your house is not really normal right so I think it's I don't think it's easy to imagine someone maybe falling or something do you think they dogs falling down the Trap the oh God I hope so I I hope they're using that to there like a yard for their dog their dog's like pissing keep the dog in the yeah keep the dog in the in the Attic next to the asbest and it just looks like asmin Gold's house I heard he cleaned his kitchen yeah he cleaned his kitchen and he's everyone's giving him like rockus Applause what's that boy what's that boy you found a Samsung a Samsung Blue Line watch up there in the asbest oh wow do you think I have I'm slime right now I haven't looked at any of the photos or anything or I don't I don't you know I don't keep up with asmin heads as so going off of no information assuming it's only a photo of the clean room do you think he paid someone or you think he did it well he said he didn't so it's like wait did he post he posted a photo of his clean room yeah he posted a photo of his dirty ass kitchen and then picture of it clean and everyone was like you did it you're you did it good job good job for doing that did he actually do it I don't know here's a point in that he didn't get someone to clean it department is that they probably Ed on his room too unless it was an all day job it looked pretty gross dude they he should have got one of those Tik tokers that goes to hoarder's houses and like cleans them have you seen those little yeah like it'll go to like like these like usually white women will like go to like like hoarding houses and it'll be like this nice royalty-free music and they're like they're wearing gloves and they're like shoveling slush and like bugs and poop and like and like gifts that they they were never given to like in cups and like glasses into like trash bags and they clean it all dude and the home's probably already been given away to the government or something the male version of this is the is the lawn care videos on YouTube yes guys guys mow Lawns for free girls uh uh clean houses for Porters I don't I don't think cleaning up absolute horde slop is a very like what is one is definitely harder yeah one's definitely like more gross and nasty but like the LA Care thing is the idea is you do it for free and then you put post a Tik Tok and then your business blows up but like I don't think posting your like you don't want the hord cleanup business to blow up also [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's the same thing yeah but I guess if you hire someone else to do it at least on the YouTu the YouTube Lawn Care side they're getting the uh cuz some of these channels are pretty big and they're getting AdSense and every video is like 45 plus minutes long that's crazy oh dude they rake and I think I think a lot of the game too is like like daughters and sons of parents who have been hoarders for a long time and they're like we can't afford to have someone fix it if you could come and help us yeah and they get like a story out of it and they and their business gets bigger I mean it's a win-win it's a little weird it's a win-win the Nami figurines from One Piece are like just encased in like a block of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dude it's have we seen that video like like a like a shungite brick yeah yeah yeah you take it out and it's like my God it's a it's a it's a mold it's a cast mold sucks bro uh uh uh what was I going to say um I lost it sorry I did that God I saved over your memory yeah that I'll get there um oh it's like that video of um the guy who asks who gets like a PC repair person to come to his house but he's filled his computer with beans yeah that's a great and he's like how did those get in there and the guy's looking at him like these are beans and he's like they are oh wow that that must mean something's real wrong I I don't think I actually don't think I have the blood to sit through a prank like that no I don't I don't like deceiving people that much it's funny that's why I don't like watching Nathan for you and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it feels wrong so awesome but I feel like asmin Gold's house is like it's like the bean guy but it's with roaches and he's genuine he's like you're talking about Pap I thought I thought all our star Forge PCS head roach dude oh my God they dropped that uh the the star Forge PCS thing it was like we at Star Forge believe in inclusivity and it's like dude like like a child a made that graphics card how many times are we going to do this how many times it's just like just say yeah that's a bad look we we're cutting ties by our computers CU at the end of the day you don't care if a racist buys your computer some badass like Japanese denim that has like a patch of their apology on it bro that'd be sick that's what I'm saying hit my line if anyone dude no they get they get a homeless guy off the street and they tattoo the apology on his back full back piece that' be sick Bro yeah and it's like I get like you have to do things like this but I'm so tired of like the stand by and align ourselves with those around the world seeking I I feel like I I read this and the only thing I could think of is like I could write a banger I think I could do it just hire me to write a banger next time you have like a guy talking about like just smiting another culture because they're imp putting just putting no Greeks in the middle of one of these somewhere except for the Greeks wa hold on what's that what do you mean by no Greeks was that a typo not a typo not a typo is part of the statement pretty firm on the St imagine it's like we had X company uh we we stand for equality and diversity and and and unity except for Greeks no Greeks we do not it's the only part that's a human voice all Ai No Greeks it's it's Hands Across the world but just like everybody else is CH chill Hands Across the world but just no no Greek people we are tired of this some guy who's just really mad about the bailouts in in like the 2010s D you see there Ser there's a someone in csgo there's like a Greek flag painted on a csgo asset and they just shot it up and they were like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is real so funny they have the same color scheme you guys want to hear about my uh my somewhat pathetic Rabbit Hole of Call of Duty modding I've been on Yeah Boy modding I've been slightly provy to this from from what's your boy modding Journey so it all starts with PSL because we ran into this problem and ladies feel free to go to the next episode if it's not out yet but just you go back one whatever you Ain did it do uh this is the moment this is where this is the moment where you say ladies this is not the 15% breaks not the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] block with nami encased in it going like this like Han Solo women love come they're always [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they're always using it for babies they're always making babies women love they're always putting [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] telling your Nami doll before you unlock her in her case of come [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I love you and you imagining her saying if you were real you'd love this world uh so all start with PSL where we having this problem because everyone wants to use their original Xbox accounts and even if we had new Xbox accounts this would be a problem but whenever we log in Call of Duty no one has anything unlocked and so we were like oh we need a way to quickly onc console unlock all the guns so that we can play competitive formats cuz old Call of Duties before Black Ops 1 they don't just give you guns when you're playing private match so I was like well there's a Modded Xbox called A J tag and if you have it uh you can do anything son and I had one of these when I was a kid um I didn't really know how to use it though cuz it was kind of confusing and I broke it um so I was like okay I'll get one of those and also a little guilty pleasure big reason I wanted to get one was you can play a Call of Duty Pro Mod was like a PC mod it's like PM it's like a modified version of cod 4 it's like slightly more competitive higher move speed fov changes rule sets Etc and people on Console back in the day would make uh mods to simulate promod it wouldn't have the rules but it' have like the fov shift and the color shift and it would look really cool it would just make playing on your console really cool and I was like oh I'll just buy a j tag and I'll just like Go download a patch for one of these that people made and I'll just play this and it'll be fun and it wasn't like that at all it was awful it was I bought a j tag and then I quickly learned that all of the forums for how to do this are from 2011 most of them are dead all of the media fire links are dead they don't make happy was a band they don't they don't point to they don't point to any of the files anymore and all the community members back then were gatekeeping their their like code like all everything that they made so the way that you give someone a Call of Duty infection patch is you have a j tag a modified Xbox you host the file on it and then you system link to your retail Xbox and then you infect Yourself by joining a private server with that modified Xbox and then your retail Xbox now won't be banned but has the infected patch and then you can go give it to a friend by them joining your lobby because if you are using the JTAG Xbox online then they can detect that something's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and they'll ban that account and there's ways around that there's these things called KVs and you can buy them you have to replenish them when they get banned you can go back online but if you want to do it without getting banned just being completely offline you just infect yourself and then you can infect people on your retail Xbox um and I thought this would all be extremely easy it wasn't long story short it was really hard to figure out how to connect to my own Xbox Etc and then I was like well how do I I if I'm going to make a Pro Mod patch I have to like do it myself I think cuz I can't find one that looks the way I want to look or like looks like any of the ones I used to have you were saying that people will like stop they they'll be like you have to use my host right yeah they'll be what they'll say is back in the in the forums is they'll be like like I made an infection patch join my gamertag by private chatting me on Xbox and joining my session in progress if you want it and they were doing that for like a week and then they never did it again they never released the file and then sometimes in the comments they'll be like yeah I'm never releasing this yeah there's no other way to get it there's no other way to get it didn't you say you also had to leave your Xbox on to have it yeah so if you if you don't have a j tag if you're someone who has an Xbox and likes using infections and you get infected the second you turn your Xbox off you don't have it anymore or even if you just go to the dashboard that's if you cuz the way I learn I hit up Auto this is what happened I hit up Auto and I said Auto read this forum tell me what it means computer translate or else I will get dangerous uh it autos and all dude all the Call of Duty stuff it's like I think it's like a proprietary language that's like based off of C++ and it's like slightly different but you know and they have like the community built programs to open Call of Duty files they're called Fast files right and uh and the the programs for the older games dude it took me so long to just get a copy of the program to open the files it took that was like a day to just get one of the programs that someone made that works cuz most of them just don't work you open them and they're like one they all read as Trojans uh two the ones that I did download they just don't open files you drag a file in just goes error and it's like okay I don't even know why this so I finally found I had to go I had to go to a a like 85 view YouTube tutorial for something else that happened to use the same program to find the program um this is what you're doing this is what I'm doing this is what you're doing at 5 in the morning he was up so late doing this this is what you're doing I was up so late I think I got up in the middle of the night to pee and I heard Nick working on this which was him just screaming at Auto to tell him what it means so me auto figures all this stuff out so fast he's like looking at it he goes okay yeah I see what's happening what they're doing is the way these infections work is they are tricking Call of Duty into loading the map that like it normally does but when it loads the map you put all of your code right after the name of the map in the code because then it arbitrarily loads everything you put with the name of the map so it's like you're playing on Crash also you're playing all of these mods and it just load crash plus big titty mod plus big and that's why back I never knew this as a kid but when you have an infection in Call of Duty 4 your map is just a checkerboard and I was like why is it a checkerboard when you're infect because you're riding over the map and that's where the map picture goes so it doesn't know where the picture is cuz you've changed the name of the map I was like oh you if you wanted to you could inject like some big ass titties you yeah you can put titties there this is yeah much like much like Mario modding Mario Kart Wii where you take a file you know you want you want peach to be naked on the bike you know how old Peach you know why you know why that gets really tricky though she Min that's the damn why not the peach part the T part peach is in her 40s surely I would hope so Mario's a plumber I don't know about you I know no plumbers under 18 they're all old I'm talking about Peach all right that's all I'm saying well they have sex so so deal so that's your problem to deal with Mario and Peach age got problematic dude the legal age the legal age musroom Mushroom Kingdom it's like Germany don't ask Nintendo Nintendo Japanese comp is that why Bowser kidna her you wanted to change the age of consent no he wants to make it 18 again he's the hero yeah he wants to go back up Mario trying time up bro wow that's when you find out the Real Enemy was Mario was Mario trying to Mario he wanted to lower the Mushroom Kingdom age of consent disgusting n Luigi's the real pedophile okay so you're doing all this thank God a funny bit to break it up we need we needed that we can go back underwater okay so uh so uh uh I I why that's difficult to put titties in the game is because now what you're doing is you're you're adding a new texture titties which is which is not something which is not something that you can infect someone with imagine this is a TED talk but it's face B it's like so why we can't put [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] titties in the game right oh we tried to put titties in the game for a long time we [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tried we [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tried like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so hard when you modern Marin Warfare 2 the we trying to make the f porn map and it'd be the best trickshotting map ever and there's titties and no always we saw you do a no scope and then you see like a big [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like a b boner big a big boner it's awesome the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] awesome boner and it'd be rains boner and I I know what you're thinking which which pH Reigns boner would it be cuz he got circumcised

Helix Sleep mattress why why is it so comfortable I say I got it from Helix Sleep mattress that makes sense Helix sleep it's a mattress that I actually use at home I'm not kidding they sent me one and I actually rep I had to go through the effort of removing the my actual mattress which is a lot but it was worth it cuz it was comfy and it's fil the other one's filled with rats now good riddens really it's it's in a junkyard full of rats it's in a junkyard but your Helix sleep is in your nice good smelling bedroom where your tiny [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rests every night it's not tiny it's awesome special October offer listen up 20% off all mattress orders go to helixsleep.com theard Nick actually uses this which is crazy I I'm going to be honest I sleep on the floor so I'm this is more of a

just don't believe you it's Helix sleep so Helix sleep you know buy it feel comfortable but don't lie to your friends about your body not doing that I feel like lie lying on your friends what are you doing I can't lie I'm in an ad well let's get out of the ad so we can start telling the truth uh uh so Auto reads Auto interprets Auto goes okay well this is a string of three numbers that are all zero it probably means RGB and I was like oh that's interesting that's probably so I was I was just like learning every I was downloading and I was like all right time to get to work and now I'm like coding for kind of the first time outside of making a Discord bot once uh but a different language and um I'm I'm a lot of Call of Duty modding is taking like code string that theyve already put in the game and and then figuring out they exist so like you know maybe one is called CG fov and it modifies your fov and you have to know it's called that if you want to modify the fov so community members will like find as many of these as they possibly can that are already in the game and then post them online and you have to by trial and error of having a modified Xbox change the values go in see what it did this takes like to test out one it takes like half an hour yeah and then they go like oh that's way [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] wrong I'll go back and I'll modify more do you think there are under 100 people right now that are doing this 100% that's crazy because there's two websites that people most there's two big websites people would post on for these things seven sins and the tech game and most of these boards have not for Call of Duty 4 have not had a post they've had like one post since 200 like 10 this is honestly surprising to me because Call of Duty was so popular and my frame of reference for this stuff is like Mario Kart Wii modding because that was incredibly popular and that's what I was doing I was like hacking my Wii and then like trying to run different mods and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on it right fuing Kong with three balls I'm sorry I just have one track mind and Funky Kong with three balls but the thing is if you wanted to get Funky Kong with three balls there's a whole ecosystem that's like very active right now with like hundreds if not like thousands of people participating in it so the the competitive game right yeah and that might be why is like the mod is like essential to participating in the game at all but it it's surprising cuz Call of Duty in terms of its popularity I feel like especially its competitive aspect was so much bigger dude the Cod forums it's all dudes from the UK you scroll through it's like one one Forum post is like look at this picture of a girl she's such a derp and then look at the second post it's like the nword and the third one is like the labors of all of my efforts have Beed fruit here is the program I've built off of the back of no money here it is community hey has anyone heard of The Lumineers they sound Prett it's like that it's just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy dude it's like here's my program it reads the Trojan don't worry about it but it does work and all these comments are like nice this is awesome works great thanks for the program and I'm like yeah I'll download it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it all these community members used it whatever if it is a Trojan where is it even going to now who's even [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] getting the information I don't care it still goes to Iran someone dropped like like a post like that someone dropped like the first really racist meme I've seen in our Discord this morning Jesus like insanely $15 to add me dude they were a tier 2 Sub it was crazy and it's like what you you paid us 15 bucks a month to get fully banned immediately also I didn't even see it I was just not from the patreon or just the Discord uh I got to ask B probably from both yeah usually if it's something like that we ban them for both but yeah guys Ben burst in the door guys you're going to want to see the patreon my God they've built a wall but uh so you're figuring this out yes I'm figuring I finally made a breakthrough I finally got this the it s it sounds like I'm an idiot dude you're doing insane [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all like no I mean for the next thing I'm going to say right okay I couldn't get my my J tag to connect to the main to the retail Xbox because I was trying to get them to connect through my router which you can do you can do that and I think the problem with that is like port forwarding and all this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I think my router is too new for Xbox 360 basically but then I just took the wire and was just like and I just plugged the consoles into each other no that's crazy actually it sounds it sounds dumb but I was like cuz I was reading online that that you could do that but you need a special like crossover cable and I'm like I just have an ethernet cable but it just worked and I was like oh bad they called them in 2011 we didn't know yet crossover before ethernet um so that worked I was like oh awesome I got that one figured out and then I got the program to work and then I got a file to open and I and then I'm like look I'm looking it's the meme at the guy looking at the main frame with his hands on his hips I'm doing that in the program I'm like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is all this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I don't exactly know why but uh in the program where you write the code you can like there's multiple lines you can put a bunch of code but you for some reason all your code has to be on one line so if you have more if you have more mods that fit on the line then it won't run it won't infect other people okay cuz oh I I I just figured out why Wow the reason why that is is because it's only for infectable mods because you can't have the map name be more than one line I bet uto if Otto is listening to this right now it's like me watching you play of Legends it's like Gore yeah he's like of course it's that way and by the way all of this for people who haven't followed why I'm doing it it's to make the game like more blue yeah this is it makes that's crazy it makes the game like more blue and you're gone a little further away f i i want to make fun of you so bad but this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like this was my motivation for making Funky Kong with his third ball I was just like this also what did you mod in Mario Kart uh it was like you could mod into textures so you could change the like artwork of the game that's local though right that um it'll beers it's all localized you couldn't do in infection stuff like this you what would you mod uh I I use the mod to install like custom custom tracks and custom like skins and stuff for characters uh like Darth Vader Mario yeah [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that like you like different alt versions of Mario from like different games Funky Kong Black Ops 2 Funky Kong really I I use that's cool I used Black Ops 2 Funky Kong for a long [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] time dude I want FaZe Banks and Mario Kart 8 you can [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do that and oh you could also mod in like custom characters and stuff like that the closest thing to infection stuff that uh Nick is talking about is you have rating online like you but it maxes at 99,999 and the way points are distributed at the end of public races is like if you beat people who are have high rating then you'll get more points Black Ops 2 Funky Kong dude he's got the two on the back of his wife beer I know it's dude he's so money is this a real track or is this in this is a real track okay uh but I would use skins like this he's he's is he alone in he's wheelie humping let's go God he's getting it my friend my I have an old friend named Blake who is the world record holder on this track and he just got the world record on that track yesterday after running he's been doing runs for like three months straight that's CRA they're going they're going to say way longer yeah he's no he's had the record at different points over the past of the last like 15 years but somebody like last year took his record so he's been off and on practicing but he went into like a 3mon play every day multiple hours and he finally got the record back do you think he's happy uh he is 100% that's great I'm I'm so glad that's the answer he has an old dude he has such a funny old YouTube video this is back when like most people in Mario Kart you had zero idea what they looked like and he posted a video of him basically doing man on the street interviews in his town where he would go up to random people and he was like would your opinion of me change if you knew I had a world record in Mario Kart Wii and then and then it would just be like some guy and and they'd be like that I mean that sounds cool but uh the the modding in the the infections didn't really exist like you couldn't give hacks to other people but what you could do is like client side stuff decided something like your items so some dude who's like modding the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of the game before the race starts could like be in a star and a mega mushroom tossing 10 blue shells and like and they would just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with you like that and they could also hack their rating to stuff past the limit so their rating would be like 50,000 right instead of the typical like 999 cap and what they would do there used to be these awful there was a two groups the the white the white hats and the black hat haers of Mario Kart Wii time there was four four the lose hackers and four the win hackers and people who would just like get into your lobby and intentionally harass you with this item [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and then win the race with like low points and make and tank your rating by beating you because if they have like 50 points and you have 9,000 or 8,000 then the way the system works is it just drains your rating because it seems like you've lost to a terrible player that's so fun but then there was these good good guys on the other side where if they got in your lobby they still did all the item spammy stuff but then they would intentionally lose the race Bo and then they boosted everybody's rating so then if you had a friend who like if you had a friend who like wasn't that good of a player maybe their rating was like 8,000 or like low 9,000 which was like bad for competitive players then you and you saw them jump to Max in like a day it's like you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cheated bro like you that's that was like the the equivalent to this in Mario Kart but all the map changes and things are client sides so like if you wanted to play custom maps with people you couldn't just infect uh or change you needed everybody in the lobby to have the mod pack like installed uh so if you th this is funny because I was I also wanted to make fun of Nick a lot yeah it but I couldn't because last year I did the same thing with San Andreas on PC dude it's sick and all I wanted to do I wanted to make it look cool and play through the game it apparently is only run right now by a Brazil Zan San Andreas Community all the mods are in uh what do they speak Portu Portuguese and you have to use Google Translate that it's insanely active they play online all the time it's crazy and but they're the only Community doing it and the kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you you have to go in and like modify the memory like allowance to like let the game access more RAM and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and like do notepad like file manipulation it was crazy it is cool how old games like this get carried on cuz all of the Nintendo stuff like not just Mario Kart anything that was on like Nintendo Wi-Fi connection like DS games like Wii games all of those servers were shut down in 2014 by Nintendo so the way you play online now is like you you have to mod your console to some degree to connect to custom servers that are hosted by this guy in Germany who just lets basically thousands of people access old online games yeah and it's been free for a decade now and that's like longer than the lifespan of the actual like console and like actual services so crazy yeah I've been thinking at the end of this it would be it would be a crime to not post everything I've learned on one of these forums right because if you're like me out there there's got to be people like me who just like don't get obsessed as I do with stuff like this who are like oh I'd love to do this B I can't find the information and they just give up yeah they give up but you're like fighting the good fight and unlocking it you I sit and stare at a string of code without knowing what code is or how to write just figure out what it means over the of hours I'll just stare at it and be like oh it's probably doing this let's test that trial and error a lot of it is like a lot of the the strings are just like you're taking like like people will make full mod menus in the game where like you press you bind your left d-pad to open up a menu on your screen that you can go through and select mods while you're playing but all of the stuff you're seeing in the menu is like taking things from other parts of the game and repurposing it and frankensteining it it's not like it's not often there are examples of this it's not often brand new code um there are examples of it being brand new code and there are people who like do this in such a creative way that they're functionally writing new code like there's there's some that like I I have one right now that like like you press a button and then like it turns your entire Lobby into like a prop hunt Lobby like it just changes the way the game works and and you can choose different models that are already in the game and it's cool the length of time because I remember like I imagine something similar here is like with Mario Kart when the mods used to be so dog [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like at the beginning the like tools available and like what people could make like looked so bad were like so rudimentary but the stuff people make now because the tools have like expanded and been built like the new tracks that people make for that game now look like new tracks from an actual Mario Kart game I think it's probably because of like it's s probably similar to like the melee breakthroughs where like they can code stuff in melee now in like what is it like in C or Java whatever it is like it used it used to be they had to work language and now they can like people have created tools to like Port it over to that's why they putong in there and Sh that's why so easy to make [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that now yeah you see that like random shift where it was just like mods were shitty Al oh my God they're amazing what all sudden it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it wasn't like a guy that came along it kind of it is in a sense but um yeah that shit's nuts well I'll have you all know at the end of this little segment I uh I figured it out I finally got a patch working that I made uh and now your game is a little bit more blue and now it's a little more blue and Sh that's and also there's more like the sun is a different color a little bit oh my God what is this this is Mario Kart taxi or G it's Mario Kart wi Alex LC 500 I was saying what's the mod I know it's Mario Kart but what's like what's the car ported from dude what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dude this game would be so much cooler if it had a real ass car Wait dude it is like Need for Speed this yeah it looks like one of those arcade Racers you dude they should make this a map like the map they're on I know it's already a map they should make this a map but you all play in the cars that are already on the road like one the bus and dude this is insane this is like cruising USA I have not seen press one by the way in the in the chat if you ever did mail bomb trick on your weave cuz that was my that was my you have no idea what a breakthrough that was it was so cool before letter bomb dude before letter bomb existed modding your Wii was such a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pain in the ass it's just it's not what you think it's if you've done mail bomb trick no no right into the yard some people use Anthrax but also a wi mod I promise it's not what you think don't freak out no it's it felt it felt so cool the first time I ever saw the red envelope and had to click it and my my wi goes bad yeah like oh my what I do you dude you used to have to do it only through like game exploits that worked based on which firm wearing you had on the Wii so like depending on the firmware you had there was a different set of games that had exploits that allowed you to do the modding that like letter bombb lets you do basically and so like if you were on version like 4.2 of the Wii menu then you had to use Lego Indiana Jones to like mod your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Wii or Yu-Gi-Oh dude and and you just like had to hope you owned one of the games and then brawl had a really consistent one which is how people would launch PM yeah yeah um cuz most people we all stand on the shoulders of DJ Zid who who eventually went insane and died his skin to become black oh Jesus I forgot about that's a that's a nuus to you name CH name new skin new name there you reminded me of something too the trial and air stuff is always funny cuz the way like uh the way code worked on things like action replays for DS games is like it's just digit like digits 0er to n rows of them and you'd have to figure out the hex line within the like Pokemon that you had to change like what value you had to change to get the change in the game you wanted and you could sit there and like trial and error like hex hex code for Pokemon games I never I never did this uh myself but I would go on forums and like browse action replay codes for Pokemon and also the DS Pokemon games were the first generation that you could trade globally for like for Pokemon in general right but now you're now you're sending Action Replay dildo Pokemon dude kind of like you you would this was the first generation where like hacking and modding was like so incredibly easy because of the popularity of Action Replay but it's also the first generation that you could just trade Pokemon online so I had a code that on my on my DS that let you just clone Pokemon you had so anything I wanted to trade for I would just find a trade of like an interesting Pokemon find the one that they wanted clone it keep my guy you got up some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like yeah you're a little crook like that replay all code give lickatongue libido what's you going to use that for dude it it's so funny you see the the crossover and the the sort of evolution of young people entering their hormonal period and then like using the skills and the time they have to to like see see boobs or something like uh I've told this before that like in brood War some of the maps you would get into was literally just to it was they would draw out a naked woman on the map and in the mini map would be like a 100 by 100 100 pixel depiction of like you know a naked woman just any you would just get in there download the map and that way to look the clip of Alex seeing the backtack penis boobs in the Black Ops Lobby is so funny to me because similar to how the mod game has had an arms race in an increas in quality I was like dude these are way better than when I was playing Black Ops as a kid like the details kind of a sounding it's funny you were talking about the the like the gatekeeping of you have to join the lobby to get infected and all that Xbox this this culture existed for a while in online games like Warcraft 3 when you play DotA so you would get because the new DOTA version would come out you could download it from the website and put it in your directory and you'd have it or which was usually I don't know faster better or worse you go into a game you beg them to let you download it cuz when you get into the game you can download the map in the waiting Lobby oh really fast and so now people downloading it implied one of two things one you haven't played in a while so you were [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so they didn't want you in the lobby or two uh you were just lazy and you didn't want to do it so it' be like DOTA 6.83 B no DL and no DL meant if you started downloading you would get kicked immediately dude and uh but but it took if you could sneak into a Lobby and get it downloaded you just had it forever now yeah so you could kind of like just get in there download it fast get out nobody knows in COD like in the forums and stuff it's kind of crazy that they're all so gatekeeping because none of them were charging for the service it was all Pride having a j tag if you want so it dep it really depends how you do it but a lot of the people that were hosting lobbies are paying to host lobbies because they're paying for the KV that lets their JTAG go online they're not hosting from their retail because if you're hosting from your retail then you can't use that Xbox while you're hosting like you just can't play Xbox and all these guys play Xbox you can't play Overlord so they either have three Xboxes which I don't think they most of them did or they're hosting on the J tag and then they're just like unplugging the HDMI and playing on their normal console while people join it people can just join it passively and get infected and they're and they're posting on the Forum like go join this game it's selfless then I think it's it's for street cred what these dudes wanted was higher ranks on the Forum webites and they wanted like to get like they wanted to go from Rookie to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you know like all forms would have rankings based on like post activi God we we and that's why they wouldn't give it away because they had they had to come to like their Forum post and join them and then Po and if you wanted to get in what a lot of them would do is they would say post your Gamertag below if you want to get in you can if you know the gamertag you're joining you can just join it but they want your Gamertag to to go through the effort of inviting you because you have to post on the Forum yeah so it's just they all wanted to be like credible online in COD forums that's all they wanted and they were paying money to do this dude we assign so much value to like crazy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's so funny this this is boy stuff yeah no it's not I don't I mean it is but like I I don't know that feels exclusionary cuz like girls are insane too it doesn't mean no it doesn't mean that girls can't do it it's just this is the type of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that you tell a dude and they're just like nice dude that's that rules I think the I think the girl social economy online is just different it was just in different places I think there are girls who did this this same [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but on neopeds I think dude I think it if we were to use the example of fandoms for things I feel like it still exists like the clout and like being the the gatekeeper of information or a person that a lot of people follow and like I don't know black pink Twitter I I think it's funny that as people online we are always one one sentence away from a Taylor Swift stand putting a 50 cal in our head yeah and I think that's kind of beautiful like we say the wrong thing and wet it up now that I think about it the women are more threatening in their spaces cuz when I was on when I was wielding my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] five stars on Yu-Gi-Oh Card Maker Forum you know I didn't have you know I didn't have violence I ready to deploy yeah well I think a lot of things evolved like the beauty of all all these things being attached in these accounts is like that you can find where someone lives piss you off it's somewhat of a bory line between modding and cheating like cheat modding in video games and cheating video games are very very closely related like you know you could argue me having an increased fov when I play COD console is me cheating right most people would just say it's cosmetic and looks cool whatever so like in my head I'm like I feel like if you if you found a big Mega list of everyone who's ever cheated in video games it's like 99% boys yeah true you know what I mean I can buy that I think it's like the the genetic code of like I don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm a boy I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's also just like the sub community of like gaming espe at that time it's just a space that is like way more male dominated to begin with dude this reminds me of miles is telling me because miles used to play hardcore while before they made the official server and it was like basically private servers that were kind of like Community run you had to get an add-on for the game that like verified you people would cheat in that and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but what was what was more interesting was that there were people dedicated to killing you during your hardcore run like basically pulling a mob to make it attack you following you around there were like these evil age like these mercenaries dedicated just like trolling and ruining your your hardcore right to 60 and that was back when it was like it was way less people it wasn't like a lot of people like helping each other it was just it was more hardcore uh of a hardcore server and hardcore hardcore and what was funny is that they were people like you were saying the white hats that would develop as as Warriors to defend dude that's so it's like a mini Society within the game more beautiful that those two things are happening than if neither of them existed exactly right it's just like they like I'm just thinking about how it's so crazy how this exists across all these gaming communities like there was just the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] psychos on the Mario Kart forum who would be like Yep this is the program that pulls people's IP from Skype [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] them like I'm dosing or like people who would like cheat in league matches there was this thing in Mario Kart league matches called uh cuz if you got caught cheating you were usually usually banned or if like you were suspected of cheating consistent suspected they put you on something called conditionals and what you had to do if you were on conditionals is you had to use a camera or like a capture card to stream you in your room starting up your Wii start to finish and getting in the lobby to prove that you weren't cheating but then people like the the arms race of like outpacing the conditionals footage like it started off with like poster recording right but then people just started pre-recording their startups and like faking it and then and then people start like you can't do it with capture cards you need to show yourself physically in your room doing it with aing not and and and every Community like devolves into these like evil and good figures that like pick a side and there's like always the normal people in the middle that just like wanted to play the game I've been thinking about you a lot I thinking about you a lot in a romantic way no no I've been thinking about how boring nor make it romantic make it romantic and I'll listen to you I've been thinking about you in a romantic way nice I've been thinking about how if I were to give you soft but gentle kisses all over your body oh yeah nipples too nipples there will be play how it

message and now we'll go back to the episode uh agdq but one person is hacking and and cheating their run and the stream has to figure out who it is it's funny because I watch a lot of these videos about like this speedrunner got caught cheating I watch all these D yeah right aren't they funny and some of them are like actually I would argue most of them are like yeah it was actually really obvious now that we think about it it I think I I had that exact same thought like two days ago cuz I watched that I think it was um who was it was it Carl jobes who who made the the jump King one I don't know kind of Reason hello AB abolute Legends yeah it was him um on January 21st he would say this slur very similar to your your lecor yeah he's Australian lecor maybe um I was watching the jump King one and it's like oh yeah like if you know anything about anything this is he spliced basically the entire run all SP it's it to me I think the first thing I thought was like gaming is actually a lot smaller like the sub communities of Gaming are so tiny yeah there's just not enough people yeah in most communities there's not enough people to like go through and check or like people that have the knowledge or care to like it takes a certain amount of Obsessed for all of this to occur in general because I've been watching these videos about they like how they broke uh the Mario people who tasses a lot the tool assp runs they get they start coding they start like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with the hex values and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and it's like how they broke Super Mario Bros 3 to beat it in like7 seconds and it's because you have to like subframe inputs and it's basically just a coding class it's like here's how the game is broken down and here's how you modify it and I'm like this is these people back in like the 1800s either would have been inventors or just like died knowing about the molecules in bread you know what I mean like we it's and it's kind of a cool thing that we've allowed like this these spaces for insane people to just be obsessed get all out out like cuz what they're doing is they're beating Mario 3 really fast they're not solving they're making up a problem and solving it like like speedrunning like we talked about but it's weirdly fulfilling and it's like The Human Condition of just doing that and making up a a field goal and then putting a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] football through it and it's fun I like that and that's why you're not insane for what you're doing even though you are and you should be shamed for it yeah yeah and the earlier time you would be shamed and I wish you were and they' cover me in tar and they cover you they cover you in liquids and juices you'd be a ghoul and they make you I'd be so you'd be a wet little ghost for all of mid cookie um what was I going to say cook your little Goose body think about cheating I keep I'm so brain fogged today I think it's all fued maybe it's the Call of Duty modding till 5: a.m. know it can't be that um it might be that it might be that uh what are you were talking about modding you were talking about dude it's like we all smoked a bunch of weed oh crazy I was going to say I was going to say um a lot of times too it's just technology advances like uh like someone will post a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like a golden eye run from like when the game came out and they had the world record because they posted on a niche forum and then like 10 years later it's like yeah everyone is like audio programs now yeah on their computers so someone will just download it and be like oh the waveforms [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] anyone would see this if back then like back then this person wouldn't have done this if they knew it was this accessible and it's for no bag that's what I keep coming back toed on the internet yeah that's the beautiful we all want to be cool on the internet we're not cool in real life yeah oh that's so fun that's why I tried to beat Golden ey really fast uh to be fair that's Ryan Lockwood I think it's well he never cheated no I'm just saying he's a cool guy he be gold fast CU he he said funny things when he did his world record well I think people who who cheat they usually cheat again because they they started running because they wanted to be notable in the community they realized the road there was a little too hard they go okay well I'll just do this little thing well like Carl J always says he says you don't speedrunners Don't cheat to get a fast time they cheat to get a Time faster they dude you know what's funny is there's there's people the people who like get caught and then double down like yeah they try to like explain in way when someone says I didn't cheat and the video is only 10% done I'm like yeah there's a guy there's one guy and his uh I think he was like an Austrian guy which name his tag was Blackie which okay yeah oh yeah like the guy this guy was up to no good and this an austri guys Austrian you say usually post an art on the Forum what art like symbols dude what an awesome shap this guy actually was this guy his tag was L sure his tag was Blackie and then and he and he speed he did time trials at Mario Kart and I remember he he was famous for the fact that he cheated like it was like by the time that I was in the community people knew that like this guy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cheats his top TRS like this is obvious he's so obviously cheating but one of the the most common way to cheat is like in all of speedrunning is using save states right and just using B Tas tasing to like get a good time and then trying to show it as your own but he did he went further he was there's this one shortcut on this one track called dry dry ruins where you hop over the sand and you just do a little hop you clear like a corner very simple but he did this crazy he and then he on July he does this shortcut where he he more aggressively cuts off the sand and like the water behind it and he like launches with like no mushroom no items and I'm watching this I'm like that's first time I've ever seen it I'm like that's crazy you can [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do that and then I at first I thought it was legit and then people told me he's cheating I'm like that's crazy cuz even with tasks that seems insane like I didn't know could make he had shifted he this this is what made it insane is like he had doubled down that he wasn't cheating for a while and then he's like you got me I'm a Tasser like I'm tasing and then people you know to explore the mechanics of a game will post task World Records to like show the limits of like what the game is right so he post this time as the task world record and he does this crazy jump and people are like this still seems weird way and then he just like no it's like you just have to nail it like I did the save states right turns out he had modded the driving Textures in the game so that the like off-road section that slows you down extended further so he could get enough speed to make this jump dude he said I want another bite so he's already in the like cheat competition and decided to cheat more and then tripled down again to insist that it's actually legit and I was like who is this for cuz we all think you're a bad guy we all think making you talk right now you're right you're right you either I made this guy talk to get me to if you played Mario Kart to get me to talk about you you either had to triple down on cheating or you had to become a pedophile in the UK and that's what it takes to get on this podcast Which Way Western man and I just I've remember it being so funny even back then cuz it was like you're already cheating why would you cheat more cheating a task is so interesting too cuz it's like that's kind of what a task is you're you're you can't do it as a human you are cheating you could just keep tasing more like you don't you don't have to break the mold that's so sick actually that's just generational I I know I always thought that was so interesting that he did that I think you know what I'd like to speaking of cheating I want to and that's actually nothing to do with cheating I want to break Nick Yingling's neck with a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pipe yeah that would feel awesome I think it feels awesome for him you come in here come in come in here he wants to break your neck like a pipe I don't want to see this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dumbass don't say that don't say that not don't do that here he comes what do you want man what do you want dude do you why now you're now look at look at how Dem you look don't close

this thing and zipper claps I'm I know some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] was like how do I put it it was like bar stool for 2009 culture dude the Chive bro illegal stuff that we should probably let off the still live like is this what it looks like right now all this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is still I hated that photo go back up yo do you think this site pays for itself still I think there's a lot of people who still visit Old internet like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like internet [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah I think I think about this a lot with like endemic fan bases that never quite let go dude they're all written by Z scroll down CRT dude Zach is putting this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] website on his back we have that TV we do have that princess TV every melee player seen the TV Mega okay this is actually a good threat yeah well it's something you like solid threat that's good if an old ass website has stuff I currently like that's a good website remind who's almost 30 okay that reminded me first of all hey first of all I'm 28 and I have a j tag so why don't you lay off me dude cuz I will [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hack your XBox I will steal your Microsoft point D you're going to be banks at the net spend concert getting [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] clowned this is what's going to happen when I meet Banks I'm going to be like dude do you remember playing together and he's going to be like no I'm sorry I'm going to be like a it's all good that'll be it and it'll be kind of it'll be kind of sad you no because then you go like I used to play with this guy this guy this guy and be like like yeah I remember those guys dude it was like we we we'd be in the lobbies together and then like this was my tag and it was like dude you didn't wear the hat much back then either you want to talk about like you it was yeah it was just back when you didn't have the Hat on I remember the Hat not being on your head as much one of the last times I ever played Xbox with that guy he uh he was talking [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to a guy on the other team on Search and Destroy and he said uh he he was calling him a loser and he's like when I when I'm older I'm going to be a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] millionaire and he was right it's kind of tight when kind kind of badass I think he was in high school when he said that it's more tight when you when it happened dude is that really all it takes is manifesting real yeah you got to manifest bro yeah yeah what are you manifesting and you have to be willing to scam some people I'm manifesting Yingling falling out of the window up there yeah no no not the fake window on the set I was to say the real window the real windows don't open in the studio we can open them okay this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is locked up like a Vegas hotel yeah but I'm going to change that I'm going to change it I have a question you know I hate to Circle back to Xbox modding but what does the J tag have in it like why is it a j tag great question it's like J date I just it's a great it's a great question Aiden so uh if you want to make one you have to know how to micro solder because what you do they're called rghs reset glitch hack and it's a it's the long the long explanation short there's like basically you add two wires and it tricks the Xbox into the booting a certain way keep calm and chive on keep calm and J tag that's probably already on there somewhere keep Cal and J tag definitely on a forum somewhere dude we we thought of the most awesome gamer tag so like uh one the menu that you boot like everything from on a j tag it's called XEX dude Charlie XEX as a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] username going back on the form and making that username oh it's so far but she was around and then posting the updated guys she was not around dead ass in 2010 dead ass [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] wasn't dead ass I think I'm right I'm checking Charlie XCX if I'm right you guys owe me 100 million I love it by Icona poop came out in 2012 so what does that so what does that do for me that probably means she was around that probably means she was around 2012 you're right uhoh I'm checking career I'm checking care [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 2008 God she released Myspace as a teenager I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] knew it bro she was around how old is she I love being right sometimes I thought she was like 2010 2011 how old is she how old is Charlie XCX oh wait no she was a teenager in 2008 so she's probably like 31 she she's 31 or 32 now nice nice recently 32 that's cool we should have we should have Rebecca Black on the podcast you think that she'd understand us oh yeah she speaks English I think it'd be fine as people not like our words I don't know I had so many questions to ask her like you think I'd be like who do you play in melee and she's like what the hell are you talking about or would she be like Kirby do you think that talk Tua would be interested in coming on no I think well actually I think we could we could get her on if we trick her we could be like hey we're actually we're going to launch a coin and we'll give you cuz she is into that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] she's in the coins oh dude she's pushing Doge and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dude no way yeah bro she's look she's taking any bag she can find we say there's a fresh lunch Le for you right here on the set we put it under a box with a I tell you this we could get talk we could definitely get talked to on in like a year a year you're no in her fallof era yeah we get her in 3 months bro you think the fall off's coming that quick Conor can DM her for us she follows him true I don't want no I don't I don't want Conor we can handle this I don't want Conor Conor to get guess dude we could get George Santos it was crazy dude when he came to the warehouse like last week he was just showing me him and George texting and I was like this is so surreal to read I love that a disgraced public official is now in Conor eats pant an's phone yeah it's amazing isn't that fun do you think Connor's in the blackbook Connor definitely is closer to the CI to knowing about aliens than we ever have been he's the closest of us you know what I'm saying absolutely Conor's tweet about oh when the when the Hamas leader uh was killed he tweeted like I'm sorry I'll will be pushing fortnite Fridays because of an issue with our next guest that's God that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] funny imagine he was down dude that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] funny what's his name the Ayatollah premiere of Iran I bet I bet brok and shoot he's old I bet brok and Sho guy guy thought were saying he was an accurate shooter I was like maybe dude him like just just yelling and farsy as Conor tries to get his interpreter to ask questions he's like so uh do you watch dream they see fary in in Palestine uh in no no no in in uh Afghan in Iran in Ira you're talking you talking about the guy who runs Iran right yeah yeah yeah me and and bro he's I know bro that guy old he's old as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm 34 and he was and he was on the forums dude he was trying to get his F to 90 you know was on dude you I bet he has the patch I've been looking for I bet that's why you can't find dude anyone out there has shiny and defying proma patch I'm been looking for that there was a j tag in the compound for sure yeah if you had visual Boy Advance and Wombo combo. MP4 he definitely had a j taged XO watching the Zero Dark 30 deleted scenes and it's Chris Pratt's character like he breaks the door down he's like dude I think that's a j tagx before they move to the second they sit down and play one out what what how do you guys feel about uh uh fruitless effort is like a hard way to put it but like so like I was thinking about I had an idea I was like okay one reason it's really hard to make promod patches and test them for Xbox is because you have to load them onto your Xbox and load them up and it takes time and it's frustrating and you don't really know exactly when when you when you punch in a value you can look at like an RGB scale and you can look that it says blue but you don't really know how it's going to rough like in the game right I was like oh it' be cool if I made a tool that like mimicked the way that lighting and color worked in the game and then you could just adjust sliders and test how it would look on like an image yeah and then when the image looks the way you want to look you can Boot It Up in the game it renders it renders it before you have to load up your Xbox do this you could make this for sure it would take someone like me a lot of time like it I would have to learn so much you just need it would take someone like Auto you know maybe two weeks right uh I'm like okay I have that idea it would be so useful to a community that barely even [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] exists anymore how do you feel about efforts like that in your life because I know you have to run into these every once in a while you're just like I want I would love for this to exist and I if I don't do it no one's going to do it I guess I could pay someone to do it feel little bit sick I think it is sick I think it's like one of the coolest ways you could like use your position of like time and money now is like spending something spending time on something that is like for a for a limited community that is not for profit to do something that is just useful and cool that like you know an a room full of people would appreciate because they don't have the resources or time to do it I think that's like how so many communities like this function that's how like open source software works it's like it's just you being willing and like caring enough about this thing is like the gateway to like it it happening and you're at the I think that's how I kind of look at star league is like star league right now is just this way penis or regular pis regular oh okay regular regular star league is doesn't it couldn't even hold a candle the normal starl it's just my it's it affects like a somewhat limited group of people it's not like fruitful like economically it's just like we get to put money into something that people in SoCal melee just really appreciate and this is exactly the same thing and then maybe because you make this tool you make it possible for some dude who didn't have the money to like accelerate his efforts to build more stuff and this community like builds more because of it I think that's cool to in a particular example you're giving of this tool it's it the word itself is important right you're creating something that helps others create which is in a way like much more selfless it just depends on your level of obsession and like cuz I don't know the reason why you started doing this in the first place came from a place of I want to I want this for myself I want this for myself and I want to achieve like a goal that I've set which is to finish this thing and make it more blue I don't want to quit yeah basically and uh I think that if you look at it through that lens like none of this is really fruitless if like beating Mario in 17 seconds is just like you wanted to do that right um so I think about that kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] too but it's also hard when you get older a lot of the speedr running [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm watching now is uh it's this one guy I should shout him out it's uh it's all like RPG mostly RPG speedruns and there's this challenge in Final Fantasy 10 speedr running or not even speed running but challenge runs where it's like nine letters it's like no sphere grid no summons no uh overdrive and it's like nsgs like it looks stupid as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but people are like a lot of the time in these histories of these these challenges it's like yeah so he ended up having to go to school and like do actual human [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so a lot of movement didn't happen on the challenge and that's what happens right but if you're in a position where you can like afford time or money to like push forward something that usually young people with a lot of time can do that is always worth it cuz that's rare yeah I like the framework of like you know maybe one reason why something like this doesn't exist is just it would it would be the effort of someone who has like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] job that and this is like a bad use of their time and like whatever so if I have like the time and the space and the to work on it like why not if you think it's kind of like I'm thinking about it I feel like it might be the best type of thing to work on in a way right it's the most spiritually fulfilling in a lot of ways it depends though I you can think it's a waste of time it's the thing currently calling to me I guess it's like you know like that could be that could change to be like a project or like a you know short film or whatever but for now it's it's just the thing I want to do zipper I sent you two photos um I just wanted to show you the patch I made now that after this conversation uh all this effort for this we're going to look at a line of code that has a misspelling in it yeah and you have to find the's Waldo and it's like looking at a finger painting let's do show show the boring one first and don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me because I said that Nick Nick is bringing software bug report to the podcast what a banger up yeah I want I'm got to I

like okay well these only benefit I we've played with rules since the first day here Nick let me step in here as a neutral party this is love I'm also neutral who dabbles in PSL who shows up now and then because he's okay he's like not that good at Call of Duty but he has a little fun two tour yeah I'm a I'm a PSL one tour if I'm being honest okay and I like shown up and I went to the first one if I recall or or maybe the second they've been using the rules the whole time so when I heard lwig say that I didn't say were I didn't say anything but I was like I'm pretty sure they've been using the rules the whole time like every single time this is just how love he he loses at something and he goes nah shit's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] whack now you're trying trying too hard this what this is what PSL actually is it's we all show up and I'm like all right what do you guys want to play you want to play like cod 4 snd modare 2 everyone goes on their phones and they're like oh you know whatever I

and we go it's so awesome we're doing this and then lewick says it's sweaty now you know what's crazy that's what happens you know what's crazy is I feel like on the podcast you know maybe in general Nick Nick might choose to exaggerate an element of that retelling to make it sound a little better saying this is bar for bar what happens this is exactly what happens every time okay interesting down down to the pizza order down to the expected Nick pizza order and then when the pizza comes they're like you only got two and I'm like it is dumb as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to only get two so you should think about that it's not dumb you know why it's not dumb ah this piss me off is there pizza I said raise your hand if I order pizza if you will want pizza okay and four people raise their hand so I said okay I'll order two cuz they're huge and then when it comes everyone wants pizza and they're like why do you get two like we're all going to eat and they're all making fun of me how do you deal with this and I'm like I just go like I'd be furious I'm like ha yeah sorry I'll order more next time does Nick get regularly mogged at PSL 100,000 views Alex is supposed to be my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
