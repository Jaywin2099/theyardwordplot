last time sauno raw cream pied somebody okay Jesus Christ not for us he's telling me that he lives a crash life and what's more crash than cream yeah I I mean yeah I do want to know right you know I wouldn't say it I wouldn't have said but I can be the mouth for now that it's out I am curious I was telling I was telling you this this week oh Jesus oh Jesus this is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] there it's not even a good impression that's not even good he's like Mickey Mouse it's like it's like Elmo or Mickey you know sound like a little bit and the only reason he's laughing is cuz he doesn't know what he sounds like in his mind he genuinely sounds you wait stay on your back I'll get a [Laughter] [Music] towel you got offer the apology you got offer the apology watch have to apologize packaging the apology apologize the thing is you don't apologize for if he sees it and you get caught you apologize it regardless of getting caught or not you have to apologize all right like you know man to man if me talking about you cream pieing someone and then telling them to stop pause pause it's bad is this an apology it's bad apology I just describing what I did you might want to add to the comments and discuss Arie free slime in time with editing is that an apology you're so gross you dude I'm just heat checking you you said you're grass guess what he lives CR we're going to play back that tape again and you'll have a multiple choice test to see if that was an I see like I'm play the tape again likeo man the man if me talking about you cream pying someone and then okay the thing is it's not about the it's not about sauno in this moment it's about all the other people listening and it's a bigger statement about how gross and carass you are what how in my C have you never creep anyone okay wo wo that is not helping you in any but you refuse to answer the question I don't think it's necessary but it's a question you're refusing to answer is it is it a crash question to cream pie I mean okay let's be clinical about it sorry let's be clinical scientist I guess we're scientist and sex isn't beautiful and awesome oh have you ever ejaculated inside a vagina e e oh that's worse what do you want I want less people to close out of the podcast within the first second pies are not sex they are an experiment love we were all created by grandp no okay gross think's we were it's just gross to phrase that way is there any fan fan with a PL Emoji in their Twitter name that's still here right now uh yeah man cuz they grew up that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] was 5 years ago are they not around anymore they're they maybe the the Leafs out but maybe they're checking back in maybe they're checking back in back by the way look okay here here here I'm just thinking and I told Aiden about this that you're a bit gross and you're part of the reason why he's gross whoa cuz I was think I was thinking about like crassness cuz I'm like I'm crass and everyone said I I was too cuz I did a northern lion stream yeah and you were too crass and they were like you're too crass and I was like first off I'm Southern lion I'm not trying to be Northern Lon I'm crass down here sure yeah play by our own damn rules play our own if I wanted to be Northern lineon i' call myself that yeah so I'm sou line I'm a little more crass but I'm not gross you're gross I'm crass what do you think is the difference uh I don't say no no no don't don't say don't say I don't do what you do penis ejaculates in vagina you say but you say it like you had experience you know what I mean like that doesn't sound like a first timer no that a first word first time ever behind closed doors you know like only in like a lil Way song like you're saying that kind of in the car yeah I'll say on the way home yeah I you know but sure in an elevator with other people you act different and on a podcast where I know hundreds of thousands people will listen I try to be a little more professional and I don't think I don't think it's too much to expect from you professional okay fine if you were to do the same joke but your crash lwig not gross slime how would you do it I might replace creen pie with back shots I might do back shots I did that the other day you didn't give me a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] metal well literally last episode or last week did I said tow dead takes back shots or whatever and everyone celebrated me like a king apparently and so but you didn't you just laughed did I miss that and also is me laughing not a celebration that not the greatest thing I could give you so you only chastise me when I'm wrong but you don't reward me when I'm good so you're saying you need carrot less stick I need cookies I need Stars so when you sorry in the future if you do a joke that toes the line well you want me to go stop great job good boy maybe after after the Pod can we have a wall where I just have good boy stickers I will I'll work on it and it's your face hair and by the way you're not a SK I was thinking of moreyo bit what yep cuz you're also gross this came up because we were whiskey I'm sorry I guess you what's it's the crass PR sorry go why I it never happens in the crass PR slime is the grossest you're the second grossest I'm the third Aiden's the fourth yeah yeah and and the thing is if yeah go ahead I was wrong Aiden's the crassest when it comes to physical comedy uh yeah he's done [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I haven't he'll put any sort of any poop in his mouth on the floor that's h i put my body on the line and my reputation if slime did this whole cream pie bit and then dropped his trousers out came from his butt oh an ocean an ocean from my butt and he had it prepared for this bit and he did that as a physical on your phones now if that's crash or gross that's so gross cuz he's literally gag that that made me gag a little that was disgusting I don't think I've ever had that reaction from these two ever in my life bro I'm saying if you stored it in there what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] why this kids you know call them frosted tur I get it I get the gun last episode that with this sperm and it's sitting there I get where it's coming from and when it falls out and it falls out all these an experiment that you're doing why do it fall all these thoughts running your head like how long has it been in there like where's it from my eyes are watering that's so that is so disgusting so you're saying you're saying that he he doesn't commit to I would think that'd be high this why I said you were second I said you were second on the crft pr a great example it's like when he came in the kitchen he broke the egg and said oppa yeah oppa so that was Art High art wow CU at the time you were mad about it it but is it takes time to appreciate I art of course art is context guys and and if art doesn't make you sometimes feel cross is it really art you're making an argument for me I'm making an argument against you cuz you use CR with your words and I want it more with your actions okay what about an Art Exhibit and it's a statue of a streamer I'm I won't say what kind of streamer okay like Uno dude we're going to get and there's a f and it's a fountain it's like a fountain it's a infinitely replenishing fountain that maybe I should he's he doesn't want to hear the rest of it I well I'm trying to make it work in his binary world of Art and not art it's it's it's ironic you have a binary world I'm thinking about I'm thinking about staying quiet so this whole clip stays on the two it just stays on the two the two shot oh yes the clip can't be yeah if I just say dead Aiden's face on my face face swap it um yeah well that was an awesome first section um would you guys like to move okay zipper can you pull up the clip uh the twitch clip I sent you you want to talk all this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and you say all these things how I am and this and that let me tell you what your friends are saying about your dumbass wait wow what is this I had fun honestly it was cuz there were some Mario players I've never played before so it was fun but oh my gosh I realized that I I have a limit on lwig actual limit oh okay that I'm not kidding that's that's hurtful might be the meanest thing I've ever heard her say ever what that's that's the kind of stuff well she doesn't say a lot of mean things that's the kind of stuff girls say when like they're only in private and no guys are around except 50,000 she was probably rocking huge audience for that here's the thing you let me tell you what why do you think she would say that dude there squeaks was also there and oh wait if we continue the clip maybe maybe she says she hit a limit on squeak you know what she said to squeak she said squeaks move to LA I want more time with you I need more but lwig too much the reason why I bring this up is cuz lwig as as all the problems you have with me speaking my beautiful mind and my beautiful poetry out of my brain I have never never felt the way she feels about you ever ever okay this was your way to make him feel good and that's why interesting I wanted to make him feel like insulting him but letting your I didn't insult him I just played footage I just played footage in offense to me zipper can you pull up the message I put in the group chat Leslie uhhuh The Other Woman present M at the event uh also sent me a message uh after the event uh she said also don't forget to ice your face you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and then what some sort of dancing I assume a rainbow frog yeah it was a rainbow frog just fro Chang colors as daning sh yeah yeah yeah so that's yeah dude she smacked the piss she just smacked the piss out of me what yeah yeah he got [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] wet up had one of the things was slap and and here's the thing you try to find that clip of F I don't care because you know why they felt that way why love jealousy jealousy jealousy of what jealousy of my game jealousy of dude you that Mario Party 4 was Despicable it was yeah Ben Ben and and our boys Discord he's like he's running it down it's just like Ben messaged me and said I think right now me and Miles have a chance okay here here's the thing I was we did every Mario Party board one one map of every game so 12 total games and and we were running it and I think of the 12 games I won like 10 miname stars and so they were getting like little like it's got to be a little closer so we had a lot of punishments and things on the wheel that were supposed to make it closer like get slapped like reasons you wouldn't want to win like this yeah here's the slap here we go you can rip that whenever you want should I count you down five she she's dancing she's emoting on Yoshi would do it two one oh my God and look how bad she feels immediately she's never done that before nice nice so the issue is looks so British it's crazy if I keep winning oh that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hurt is it he [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] SL I can't even think anymore [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] B okay uh yeah I I uh I you know the more I win the more insufferable I am I'm the worst person to lose to so I just got more insufferable and then they try to get me more drunk thinking I would play worse but they don't know that like there's a Sleeper Cell in me that when I start drinking like I do play worse but like yes they could have read the manual this is all in the documentation and I felt like like the Hulk like I was I was like but I was Mark Ruffalo mode but there was there P or Bruce bra Banner Bruce Bruce Eric bner Eric B Hulk yeah that's his name and I kept twitching like like oh I need to go to the yard like I need to fight one I'm on the yard I'm drunk and I'm playing Mario party like it was a beautiful full circle moment fight someone there was a a they did they did speed wagons for the Mario Party heads uh the best time is 9:3 the most realistic time is 9:15 and we were watching out there and Yingling says he's getting 9:31 which is like a funny fake number you say as an insult it's like I've never even really seen anyone get that number and and they're they're they're racing and they're neck and neck it's him and squeaks they're right about the cross cross is 9:31 it was Battle of the morons dude you're trying to be like hurtful it's like it the experience would have been even worse if I'm playing to the degree you expected it would have been insufferable I just wanted it for me I know but you you have to understand the context is that's like game eight and the other seven I've washed them I'm I'm Shack at home I'm I'm just retired I'm watching Kobe still play and I'm just like I just want to see him do it and it's like KOB Kobe's up 30 and you're like dude I wish he would [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 360 dunk dude he was not you were not up 30 I was up 30 dude I was up 30 only wait how did the scoring work only W two more mini games than squeaks I'm up I'm I'm up 30 in the context of the entire thing is what you're not understanding yeah I knew win the whole thing I know so four is the One You're supposed to be amazing at it comes so late that it's like if you're up 30 and then you're also now swagging on them I get it you don't you want it to be close I do but but it sounds like it wasn't before four even got booted up yeah they Chang the scoring system I couldn't throw yeah we had to change the last ones are worth more okay all right all right we had to pull a lot of strings and it still didn't end up mattering it was also it was also funny cuz you were trying to determine how to like seat it so you could pick teams and you like went back to an old VOD and you were like oh Ray is the worst and then she kind of crushed yeah I forgot Ry she people almost sometimes get mad at her how competitive she is I've read this I've read this online what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you reading where are you reading this I've read I read about you browsing snark subreddits in Daily Mail I was reading Ray weekly I was reading about yes Al account on [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] r/ like I was reading I was reading things just let him RA in this girl am I not allowed to I'm sorry you know what I shouldn't be informed you on the roomy rumors sub it sorry it was an audio book The Room rumors I don't think it's real roomy rumors get that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up let's do roomy rumors uh yeah so but it was still fun I was thinking about Al Eat It Like agent get it trending I keep saying that you see really I say it on stream I'll be like you say eat it like agent I'm just like eat it like agent you're CR huh that's not crash oh sorry it's not gross me back I miss input I am crass I'm not gross that's what he meant I always said I'm crass but I don't think that I think I think the thing you did earlier was insanely gross but you said it would be art if it actually happened here's the thing I clearly have a track record of a large female audience wow including the number two best female tennis player in the world okay right right and you don't you don't and do you know why because there's a lot of similarities from my product to this product isn't your female audience like 15% huh it's like 15% lower barely that means that ours is higher ours is larger the yards is larger though the yards is 15 is 15% no I'll check it right now you're welcome bro he loves stats I love when he stat checks check cuz he loves checking pull I'm pulling it up right now pull up yours pull up surely surely we have gotten not less women over time right surely not surely not surely more of them have stayed you gotten proportionately more men okay I have the number okay you got yours on three we say on three yeah 1 2 3 12 the same what you say .1 wait what did you say 12.1 look at the point 12.0 by you misogynistic [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] don't know how to make a community welcoming for women crazy that is so insane it's gross what you've created here you here I will say after what you pulled that made them want to throw up and me laugh a lot it is going to reduce the amount for you andash you are you there is one woman out there listening I was like you know what too much the men might find it the men are going to leave in equally the men will cheer the men the man will cheer to be clear you a man was not cheering none of you cheered and you also gagged so I feel like it might just be a equal you called it with an ocean it was just okay well let's not go back to so much see I always want to go back to the things I say yeah and don't Don't lecture Don't lecture me 12 12 my God you 12 you can't call me 12 by the way 121 cuz I 5'1 vers 6 feet yeah God damn it and I got Coco yeah she's you're famous dude I was so surprised you're you're famous well she said Kai first well she say she said she said Kai and Ray first yeah yeah number three of the totem po much like Ray much like Ray said she KOCO probably watches you know some of you and then she reaches her lwig limit I I do have a limit she did say I was like a drunk frat guy uh more than a little brother cuz she's much older and I think that's a fair what she's what you called her her what she said I was like you call her much older's much older I see I get it more shots to fire I like this she just said she she explain that hang that's probably what you said to her that makes sense wasang as and she thought it might be hanging out with like a little brother cuz I'd be her little brother cuz she's older she's older we said much ear much older much older she's older Jerry and you're 30 I wouldn't say she's a little you think her bones are in danger I I don't she should probably be drinking milk you think so I would recommend it when you get up there you should be drinking milk I think daily vitamins are good for people of all ages yeah not just 30 something year olds I we're on track we're on track for two influencer Community apologies right now yeah one of them you expect and one of them you kind of don't we can't talk about it I don't want to go any further but I saved her career so you saved her career I saved her career yes sir yes sir I did you did I saved her career so I don't feel bad about I don't think that would have harmed her career I'm going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] too straight uh Coco is 20 years old 20 is crazy she's a posty what is that posty post 911 post 91 I oh interesting phrase yeah I made it up that's also what they call Post Malone H that's also what they call Post Malone they call him poy posties like fans yeah I thought that's what you meant I was like why have a son that's fourth on her list as she kept going yeah wow do you think that there's do you think that uh Luca is now going to go home and and watch one of your streams I think he thinks I'm make wish kid I don't think he knows you you dog the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of shake why you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do this to this guy how did I dog shake I got him free tickets to the Lakers game front row he got recognized by the Lakers player who was allegedly beating his girlfriend and he said dude wait tough fit to shake yeah dude I brought I brought this up I was like do you know that do you know that Jackson a beats his girlfriend and I think I sucked a little the life out of that story for that boy can't win yeah cuz it was a much cooler story before he said that but now I just I don't even want to say well the the burning question how is the chemistry Shake drizzle and Poké man was it there was was it bursting from the scen I think you know that if you put that level of pressure on an interaction he'll throw it I mean I feel like it's bad you you kind of scrape your way into an invite here you Vibe with Jackson Hayes and you don't hit it off man respectfully I'd call it a disaster but did he drop any like did he make her laugh I I yeah I think I think I think he she's not watching this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] speak man I don't think the expectation from her end was that it was like a date and I think people have that impression because of maybe the convo at the white elephant I think I see Shake drizzle anywhere near woman I'm like that's a date so I'm just like how could you resist his Aura I okay you guys are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] F around I believe this catch bro I think he's a catch and I want and you know I want to catch it po man she goes up I will say and it's Shake week he's been he's been on fire Shake week is pissing me off it's Shake week yeah because it's at your expense for once all he's doing is just lying on Twitter for [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] likes and cloud and so preo tweeted out logs of sin being like you're hot and and he was like ew you got to stop talking to people this way and then Shake tweeted out second gay she hit on this week no no he said he said and I and I save these seems she has the thing for gay guys which is way funnier yeah because CU I'm the gay guy cuz I'm gay and David preso is gay that's and then and then and then you're gamer of the year we had the picture of us on the Jumbotron Shake got cropped out and he called in a bomb threat he he threatened no no don't ex stop exaggerating okay what was his exact he said let's be respectful to shake he said I will burn your headquarters to the ground okay what yes thank you thank you it was I'm trying to gather all the facts it was a it was like some sort of Twitter of a sporting news outlet and they said squeaks pokem and lwig spotted at one piece night Lakers and it was a picture of the three of us and then Shake said you know cuz he was cut out of the picture I will burn down your headquarters and then they replied I'm sorry and he said I'm sorry I threatened arson it's a fair apology can't it be a he he identified exactly what he did wrong can you be charged if you apologize no yes no yeah of course shoot a man in the skull and you go s we you if you say if you were genuine like honestly I'm sorry so Luigi man Jon trial is going to be crazy huh he's not going to apologize but Shake tweeted out he didn't do it true CU he didn't do it apologize the offline TV account tweeted out the four of you at the at the at the baseball game or whatever it was and then C shaky d quote to says Pokémon man is so nice smiley cutie Cinderella replies and says you're not even sitting next to her low bro because it's not it's squeaks uh Pokey you shake and then she and then shaky D replied and said lwig asked me to let him ISO whatever that means now I just want to bring this up to the court what did that mean when you did ask him to from far away that does seem to have a bad implication yeah cuz you want to talk about that ISO he's saying I'm trying to Riz up Pokey with the result of which Shake [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] heroic tweet is that cutie gets flooded with the M's saying your girl's getting stolen oh what a hero your guy is what a hero your guy is harassing a woman do you think he was harassing I think he was taking some of the tips from Jackson probably whoa oh I don't think that's too far here you are so Shake has got you all riled up you're like me in the old days cuz cuz you know cuz you know when asked him about it when we're back at the warehouse he's got tail between the legs he goes bro was funny bro yeah because he's a nervous guy he go bro it was funny bro it was laughs it was all laughs I texted lewig at that night uh of the game I said did shake and Pokey Vibe he just immediate response not even a little bit bro I just said bro bro okay they definitely like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] she came to his DJ set the next night what that's awesome yeah shake did his first DJ set he looked [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] good up there too sh it's Shake Year bro yeah and Pokey came yeah yeah yeah well he he you can't you didn't lie good enough he lost it he lost the ability you lost your your spell slot came to me in my greatest need Shake was over the mic and he's like this next one's for you pokey he looks out he doesn't see her she didn't come he's like it's uh actually this is um for no one uh speaking of I uh I dm'd C when all that was going on and I said uh bro you're getting cooked and she said I'm going to kill myself Classic Center response like I'm so confused I uh I genuinely don't remember this at all it's funny uh but I'm going to kill myself my mentions are terrible to which I replied love comes and goes they say when a family member passes at a certain point we can't even remember their voice broken heart been there he said um I'm going to list you in my suicide note saying this to me DMS is worse than tweeting it publicly yeah it is cuz it's not for anyone else but [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] her and then you reply I'll be sad to forget your voice too heartbroken yeah she uh I mean look everybody's fine I I thought CU cue's response is really funny she's like don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] own it just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] own it when she dug too she found a few more she's found a few more more and not as egregious not as egregious as the as the first offense but to Shake's point if she's in preo's chat saying oh my God David preo Fame imagine how much she's saying it in private well she's saying about a famed gay preo so she thought I was gay too yeah so it's is purely platonic I think that's a that's a I actually think cut and dry defense she is in the clear done deal yeah she thinks you're a gay just thought you were super but that should have been her defense her defense I forgot if she her defense was I thought he was gay that'd be fire she's trying to protect your cuz you are not out yet my secret cutie Cutie the she is being such a good beard for all these years for so many [Laughter] years oh oh wait I have something to show you guys uh can you pull up the picture I sent you uh zipper personally on your fun episode of bringing things up yeah I came already I didn't have [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to do today Mark Mark Mark are you pulling up no Mark oh never mind so I did this just today uh this is Kel's desk and I put a I I changed his keyboard out with one what for a a gigantic keyboard what for a child or an elderly woman and can you I won't be here probably I'm not here as much and most likely can you tell me what he h what happens when he sits down at his Des I'll be here tomorrow morning I I'll tell you but that is comically large so I bought it on a whim uh cuz John had one at the offline TV house remember we were touching we thought it was so cool cuz we don't drink at parties bro it costs $200 and it's useless it's it's like it's not useless it feels really good to type on and here's my get my bet Kelby will come he'll be like what's this and like shut up Kelby sit the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] down and do your job like you always say to him and he sits down and he'll start like using it a little bit and he'll say I kind of like this Mark it mark it on your calendar so off so off I think he will no you know what he's going to do are probably the worst Kelby Whisperer of all time no I'm a God what will he do he's going walk in he's like kind of like weird weird L straight posture it's always weird he's he's going to walk in he's look down he more way way less like who got me and more just confused he's going to be like yeah um what's this and then no one's going to have an answer cuz no one's paying attention and then he'll be like okay and then he'll like unplug it and move it somewhere else and then he'll go find his keyboard that would sucks so bad I think it's exactly what he's going to do and he'll tell him later and he'll be like yeah I was confused cuz he doesn't want you to to win I think you're right about that I don't think that I think a lot done it on Nick y's test cuz he would have come back and be like my keyboard grew while I was phone did someone pour water in my keyboard no we're done today stops today's the day he he kicks down the door it's like a dinosaur capsule lwig and someone poured water on it and now it's a T-Rex Chad we're done with this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] today we're done with this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Nick Yingling has served his company loyally for too long to be degraded to young child child who discovers Wonders of the World on a daily basis he's more than that don't what are you holding back I'm trying so hard not put your hand outside your mouth okay Nick he wouldn't say any of that he knows play's not food but what if it looks like it I'm being serious really realistic he knows keyboards don't grow if you water them okay yeah yeah we're sorry B we got it it's uh you're right you're right much my mom was just here and uh she listens to the podcast and um I was like Mom this is Nick Yingling and she goes oh you're Yingling and he Nick Yingling's never met my mom and he goes why'd you say it like that like he was wondering why and cuz he was like instantly like what like what have you heard and she just starts talking slower like oh you're Nick Yingling I'm Nick's mom did there was a moment before the show before we need to just swap one of the mics and poor poor this is not dick Yingling and Dan were breaking down the set from the marathon stream and the sh was stuck on the mic stand and it took them a couple hours to remove which to their credit I was there at the beginning this was so difficult I just left I was like it's 3:45 I'm giving up on this task so I I did not stick it out and and solve the problem but I thought it' be funny to tell him to come in and see that we're struggling with the same task right now and he's like I came in cuz are you are you guys [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] saying like I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dumb cuz are you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with me or something I was like whoa whoa he was very tense like a cat maybe maybe it's gone too far well I I have I have a solution to this problem what you two are not allowed to enter that space for more than 15 minutes a day you keep trying to this is like Trump trying to Annex Canada you keep trying to make us pay for existing over there it's so weird you have this why are you not in your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] head like that it's like this agenda it's like this agenda you think is a joke and then he keeps saying it and you're like J why he why do you want to charge us for being in that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] space because it's not your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] space you don't work here he works here more he has been saying that a lot he has been he been doubling down on it lately he's an employer takes care of his employee okay I only make eight times more than these guys it was seven last time we talked which is really fun a going up a little bit that's Beast [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the irony we've cut his pay that's Beast [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we had to cut other people's pay more to make has to chip in and that's beautiful we're all chiming in so anyway I these guys my job is protect them and you're hurting them I am not hurting England okay what what did you do to Kelby this week what' you do to Kelby this week you know what I did I talked to him about music on Discord no what did you do to Kelby oh yeah I I got behind him really close without him noticing and I screamed in his ear I I was at the office all day on Friday waiting to go to the Lakers game and I'm lying down on the couch and and there's a moment where slime walks in and Kelby has been in a meeting for like 20 minutes and he literally has to mute his meeting turn to slime and he goes slime this is a client please oh my god he has to do that to you and I wasn't I was a good boy okay but it's not I I walked out I walked the background of the frame I did this at the camera and I kept walking and he still still has to get it in get he still has to get it in Scream while he was in theame no no no no no it was he was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I was genuinely going to say I if you did that I was like that's unlike you like yeah I know my limits I know but like the fat just saying also Ying comes in here saying hey do you guys he's EP on the couch I just arrived you British Nick's here and then Nick alen goes do you guys think like after a stream like lowick just had did the set feel like ran through you think it feels like ran through like no Yingling it doesn't he's like I think it's ran through the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you talking about it feels a little ran through no one stunk in here he just saying does it feel a bit he's using the term violent to say does it or ran through say does it feel violent [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what it did stink in here it's it got stank up by you guys yesterday and not by not by the other three which there was an array of garbage on this set that was left behind I go in there and what do I find I find a massive Dunkin Donuts coffee so I know it's not slimes which it usually is and it is filled with mold up the sides it is e I love when it's not me I found it in the secret little cubby over here no way and they put it in there it's somebody put it in there gross can you believe it gross can you effing believe it so it was going to ran through what what do you think if we find the guy who did it what should we do to him what should we do to that guy God damn is he sorry um I probably probably probably not really actually I haven't heard him apologize in a long time so mad but we should probably give him off the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] warning otherwise it's just a bad example oh just a warning I guess yeah yeah well what if we don't though we an example what we do to him yeah what if we make an example at his tuck I bet he's not a small dick too we can crucify him we crucify him on across tiny Co from all hands and too religious maybe he gets everyone a coffee something monetary he might be able to handle it monetary but then spiritually still he doesn't have to pay for anything jerk him off we have to jerk him off jerk him off as a punish you probably wouldn't like it you no youer like he does usually I'll jerk him off you should I'm cool with that yeah yeah you yeah you know what you find this guy you beat him off find the guy who did this and beat him off the last [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] thing I do all do that dude yling too we were sitting over there and wait what did you like touch his foot by accident no we're done no no we're not going to BR every [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] interaction you got to keep his name out your mouth I was I kind of like I was just chilling on the couch I had my hand up like this and I just kind of put it down like that like I complete accident I just touch his toe on he and he has socks on I just touch his toe and he goes and he goes he goes don't do this is so normal this is so normal and my argument cuz I get in comments ever since this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] podcast started is that that means you're autistic I think I think he's met the tickle monster I I think he probably just set his boundaries and it made him feel uncomfortable and he said that and he voiced it which is what you're supposed to do and then you walk over and you go you're autistic you I'm I'm SE a theme here I'm not two two people not employed by the company harassing workers at the company oh what a surprise I didn't say what a surprise when this happened I didn't say anything I just looked the way SpongeBob looks at Squidward when he finds out he likes crabby patties you said you're autistic now boy I no I didn't you said you got theism boy that's crazy I thought was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rude so anyway charge me then cuck I much stop calling me cck you keeps doing yeah you are just really coming at him with that I will start charging you or I don't even want to charge you it's I got

are on no you're little spoon clearly you little spoon thank you lwig that's what I was saying you would clearly be little spooon no but that that's the whole core of our argument he thinks it's about size it's not about size it's about Vibe and and Aiden is a little spoon Vibe than imagine tall than me but we just went over that but I think went over that I want to go back over it cuz I think that's the end of story can you the scene for me yeah so we were in we were in our bedroom the shared bedroom me and Aiden have and we're rustling in the middle of the night and I'm like roll over honey cuz like call him honey home and he was like no I'm not going to roll over cuz I want to be the big spoon the big spoon and I said Aiden in this Helix sleep mattress that we have that we took a sleep quiz for and we had to check we had to check our compatibility it said you know what it said at the end of the quiz it said that tall people should be little spoons wow really quiz does a lot to help you find your perfect mattress but it doesn't say that I should be the little my God I'm pretty sure the quiz can help you find various Des designs with memory foam and cooling features and then also a taller person who's a little spon imagine me you the Sleep zones serve a purpose I'm wrapped around you like a cocoon you need the jaws of life to get out buddy here's the thing if you and your girl do the Sleep quiz and it's not compatible break up with her today oh my God if you guys do a sleep quiz oh my you don't even have to you could never talk to her again for the rest of your life

Bon literally no I'm in its bones you're not as part not as much as me I'm in its bones you're stop saying don't creep it's in its also you leave you like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] off the thing is is like

bones cuz he set the bones up so crookedly he set the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up like HH ohms I said it up somewhat crooked so the bones but so he could never be taken out his bones could be never taken out it's dangerous very difficult to take his bones he only he knows how he set them up and he set them up where if you pull one wrong collaps like giang they're special bones are is a money laundering business amen and he set it up crooked so that it would function better they just laid off like 6,000 IRS employees in this like whole Federal layoff there is never been a better year rug to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with our tax this year's the year I'm thinking yard meme coin rug pole like 24 hour we get out we make like $4 million oh let's do it yes I'm in we we meet up with brother Banks think

Pocket game where you can open them for free it's embarrassing no it is real Pokemon it bounces out because all you do right now is eat pancakes at home so you've been saving money on food yeah look at you no I'm eating better no I'm actually e worse anyway it's it's you get like you're eating worse for sure we opened up your fridge and an ancient smell came out yeah it smelled like I uncovered a pharaoh what do you have in there this Happ I just well my fridge died I think I heard his fridge scream yeah I think I open the door willhelm screen it sounded like the academy in there's a lot of stuff that need to be thr the more I uncover about your life at home right now it makes I I feel like I need to call Cutie like it's getting desperate dude n we're doing good speaking of cutie I we went to we went to Deco Deco for a little bit and it was off the clock cuz they were streaming there and I was walking around and I was looking at all the pieces and I wanted to eat a couple not going to lie to you they're so yummy look tasty and I was actually we should go do a sesh I'm not we should go do a sesh I'm not a deco yeah it looked kind of fun and I was saying we should Deco ludwick's head and we should put all sorts of awesome the window is going to CL on that the edible Con Ed AR what's the edible like material that you make with cakes fond fondant fondant I want a fond head I want to make a I want to make a a helmet I make a c helmet for cake helmet for I want to eat the helmet off your head it's decorative but I will take a bite I'm going eat it are we still on Deco or what no I kind of got off that yeah okay just the cake decorating no we do it at the spot and make a cake helmet for you it doesn't have to be at Deco Deco it just seems like it would be the most convenient I need a phone case anywhere and I liked my last one but the issue is it's so fun to break apart what do you mean cuz you make the case and it's made with like this Rubber and it's like a material you want to break a so it's going be so hard for me so so so you start flicking the charms and they get a bit looser and then and then one day you get to peel them replenishing cycle go make another one yeah I love breaking them apart you got an infinite money glitch you guys are the autistic that's C you guys dude you have to stop calling every trait that people like a my eyes are open now you get pelted with it for years you start to see the world you guys in school did you guys ever have those magic erasers that were like the white erasers that like were supposedly a little better yeah you did you you did you have to resist bending them so that they would break no I would bend him and break them and then be like oop oh you would just do it you wouldn't even resist that's what it yeah cuz that's what you did with the bottle I would literally i' bend it until it got to a point where it'd be about to break and I'd be like I Edge it I would keep do and then eventually and then eventually a little tear would form and I'd be like I lost and I'd break the whole thing I I'd get to do it but I'd be like it didn't feel good cuz I lost yeah you're just a freaking goon at your yeah that's baby gooning yeah uh I yeah I have all sorts of problems now also not a phrase you say by the way baby gooning yeah that's the one it's time for baby goon no keep saying it it's like a a show that plays when you're homesick from school cuz you're not supposed to be watch never see it goes Mor baby Jerry baby Loy Tunes he plays it dude I would uh I you know the smelly erasers yeah I bite the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out I just wish they were and brown chocolate eraser do you guys remember it I think we talked about on the show before already zipper pink brown chocolate eraser it smelled so good do you think they still they're probably you know what they're probably in a warehouse somewhere like on eBay but they probably lost all their magic oh you could definitely get one of these they magic they sell their magic no cuz the scent goes away they had an awesome awesome motto it was it's pink it's brown and smells good that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nuts I made that up uh it's it's literally none of these oh really uh but it is from the book fair remove chocolate remove chocolate oh it's from of the one of the evil book fair scented you know what's the goat flavor aopo of this kind of is the the Fruit Stripe zebra gum it just lasts for two seconds yeah but it's a goated flavor they I can't it's it's none of these weird uh they should make a longer lasted version and it's like more expensive dude I also oh they should I thought you said they did I was like zebr like grown up that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] when I was a kid I would do the Fruit Stripe tattoos yeah they they had the tongue tattoos and I would do all yeah I remember on like the Fruit by the Foot or the fruit strip zebra no the tattoos were for your tongue bro you're put on your arm tongue put them on your skin no no no it's for your tongue tongue tto they're for your tongue bro you take the wrapper off and you put it on your tongue and it puts a tattoo on your tongue yeah but it's for your skin the directions are the little zebras doing it Tong hat were a thing he's wrong I'm saying this is the fruit strip zebra gum that the rapper we talking about two different products maybe FR by Fruit by the Foot had a c whole ad campaign it was on that was on the product it was on the food though right yes yeah yeah you would do it on the actual food and they had commercials where the kids would be sticking their tongues out all the kids in the commercial would I could be confusing what by Jesus Christ press for firmly for 10 seconds moist and skin slightly kill yourself that's the zebra he's doing activities I think I was putting these on my tongue yeah that's bad why turned out weird generational Gap this is the generational Gap I think I might have been thinking of that too I've never seen that in my life you've never seen the zebra my mom didn't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] around that I don't know what that is uh really I wasn't allowed to have sugar rule 34 can we check oh that zebra gets [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I feel like this is the one that beats it my understanding of candy and snacks from that time period existed basically solely through commercials because I never actually got to eat them yeah the only propaganda that got through my mom was cereal and she thought all cereal was fine but everything else yeah what the fu dude that's such a ripped [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that that is oh God that is actually no like ripped like jacked yeah that is such a jacked that was really is wasn't confused and I wasn't happy hear the second issue I was just explaining what I said no that was actually a rule 34 promise right there that was like the rule delivered the category was small you looked up for and then you saw most of the time it's like oh Lux rule 34 yeah yeah I know it exists for Lux oh wow that one's impressed like r one 200,000 results on the first page a lot of that's a deep cut that's the first time I've been impressed well yeah the the the Hipster thing to do was get an actual Fruit Stripe zebra tattoo oh that's cool maybe like the glow-in-the-dark ink yeah and he plays basketball but it's it's been it's like it sounds cool right immediately but it's obviously been thought of immediately by a million yeah yeah it's like people who get like the the yeah the mustache on the finger or like the lips yep yep yeah same [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] different day dude you're dumb why yeah why dude Read My Shirt By the way you know what this says yeah it says Seinfield no say it the way that you pronounce it Seinfield cuz I was I was saying it myself I'm like I don't think I'm reading this properly what is it that's it it's just anim no they should have called him creamer uh you're dumb because you were playing you've been playing Yakaz zero yaker they should have called him cre they should called him creamer I don't know I don't even like that one you've been playing yaka a zero and you told me to play it so I could learn Japanese uh no I said you can practice Japanese that's dumb why that's dumb they speak ja you watch anime I'm sure there's a part of you being like I'm learning no come on no oh dude yeah noar you don't learn by just watching an anime yeah but you're combining this with taking lessons and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] no not when he was watching Chinese dramas you could do it if you were actively like thinking and learning while like doing it like you'd have to it' have to be an active process you can't just read the subtitles no no no that's what you you can't watch with subtitles that's the mistake that people make that's what I'm saying that's how I watched all the Chinese dude I watched so much Chinese TV with with no subtitles I don't know what they said most of the time no but then it forces you to figure out stuff some of the time and that's how you turns that's how you learn that's how you figure is going to be so funny edited it was so funny to go in this is the old old house watch him on his computer which is basically in the living room just watching some like Chinese show like where they's walking in a city and there's Chinese subtitles and he's like eating cereal he knows nothing right it's F it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] awesome I I watch I I'm Ser I'm dead serious I watched one of the best TV shows I've watched in the past probably five years you couldn't tell you three of the characters names I don't know what the character's names I can tell you the plot like loely but I can't tell you the characters's names like small details but I can tell you what happen you were just filling in the blanks with awesome stuff in your head so good great TV show there's different mediums for this that's cool so like a Chinese person watching sance and they're like yeah he goes to this office and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't know why honestly it would be awesome to watch sance that way try to piece it together he's really horning the office he never [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he's really sat outside of it it's a it's a really great show I think they're all they all it's a Burger King I'm not sure I don't know what they do like oh yeah yeah that's right that you're supposed to feel that way white man met a met a Badd Asian woman fumbled her and then split his brain in two pieces yeah the Chinese guys want to like hell yeah hell yeah [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] how it work uh so anyway y Yakuza it doesn't help to know I'm just saying shake down shake down Sama I wanted you to play beats you in the street and takes half of all your Yen yeah that's true I know and it doesn't help to know that I just saying I wanted you to play it and I thought

you could post it for the first hour it's actually my fault for not clearing the card or I could have gave him a fresh one but I didn't we have one hour and that's it and and I never got to finish the movie but you just post the first hour it is crazy cuz uh I never seen a Bollywood movie they just occasionally break into like a 15minute long musical number with a full choreography and it's it's it's not like kind of rips it's not like American musicals where it's flowing the story through it's kind of like a separate world so like there's a scene where two people are falling in love and they just suddenly are in front of the pyramids in Egypt and they're dancing in front of them that's how you make a and it's expressing them falling in love but it's not they didn't go to Egypt in the movie in the story it's no that's just what like love bloom yes and they just clearly rented out the pyramids and want the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Flex that's cool well I saw a lot of like the old uh like action movie sequences not even that old but I guess old now like 2015 like Bollywood action movie [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] where it's just like a car explodes and then seven do and it's like it the scene is like 10 minutes long very cool yeah yeah it does feel like every has squeak seen like a ton of Bollywood movies did he pick from a pool or no he's seen he's seen a good chunk wow he keeps telling me I guess I guess he thinks I don't believe him but he's like dude I'm really Indian I'm like okay all right yeah he's like you I'm born in India you don't get it dude I'm really Indian I'm like okay awesome that's and and then I'll say how do you say 37 in Hindi and he'll be like it's not about that no it's not about that cuz he can't do that you're being an [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cuz he can't do that so if you were wondering he can't tell you he can't speak and then you be like I mean he he won't say he can't speak Hindi Aiden but he can't tell me 37 it's funny that's a low number and I could do it in Japanese age could you do it in French sanana no that's it that's it in Japanese yeah slurred can you say it more clearly that's how you say it you want me to say with an American accent sure San junana sess sess yeah I like how you're like bro wait till you see the bakas thing and you said chat link it as if it was a popular video it was hard to find I don't know why slime was like someone linked the bakas clip it's just just character from yaka zero saying soes and he linkes me a YouTube video with 50 views and like seven dislikes I'm sending it I'm sending it to zipper what's the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Caleb showed us of the dudes who drink oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] was it called it's like it's like Foo like drunk Foo or something drunk F or something D he was like he was like yo have you got okay I don't know if it's drunk Foo but it's it's close to that he was like yo you guys drunk food we're like no what's that he brings it up it's like a YouTube channel with like a th000 views or less on every video of a bunch of dudes who get really drunk and do exercises yeah they like lift like they like bench and then like slam a beer and then like do a headstand and like throw up no we haven't seen this channel no one's seen this he was talking [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] PewDiePie he's like no you've seen that right and then he we all watched like a bunch of videos we're like this is awesome but no we haven't seen it oh yeah okay this is kind of hard cuz it's like a 3se second clip so the context is this is an American guy that just shows up and teaches you combat and there's no he doesn't actually have a lot of lines he just has an introductory line and then he talks in text so they just they speak it's a Japanese game they speak Japanese mostly in the game but that guy just say sodas it's so funny bro that's what you sound like that's all I sound I sound like that's what you sound and I'd be an honor to be bakas yeah he teaches a young man how to fight [Music] I don't know man I I don't think you actually have the time with how Japanese going you're you're about can I talk is the trip revealed that you're going on the trip yeah yeah I'm going on the trip okay so when you when you go on this trip with Michael reefs between the two of you do you think you're Japanese is going to be a help on this on this trip give me like a scenario like I'm on the bike and I you're on the bike in Northern Japan Northern and I'm talking to who like a guy I work it's snowing and your bike gets your bike gets damaged it's really hot and the only place that can go he can go to get it repaired is a fishery a fishery to a fishery and and you see you see a fisherman you do see a fisherman but no fish you have to ask for help with your bike and also maybe some food you're need food do I need a place to sleep and no you got that locked down no that's good and you also need to convince him that you and Michael are not a gay couple CU you're in Northern Japan he's extremely homophobic he's extremely homophobic yeah so you got to you got I need money from this guy and he's willing to help you does think you're in a gay relationship he could he could give you food and maybe fix your maybe it's the skills to fix your bike we don't know or maybe he knows where mechanic is directions to a fishery or a mechanic that'll probably do it too he's in aici in in aici in okay well Nick's not paying attention but you understand I feel like I'm getting a lot of mix signals I don't know if I should follow Nick Nick said was right except the fishery part I would I would go I would go k chiwa okay lwi Yoko okay and he would probably say dude I speak English oh that's perfect so my bike this is my plutonic best friend Michael Reeves just kidding I only know that sentence I can I can go I can go I can go wait why did that sound so good was that real no that last party said which means makes no sense bike no what the hell that sounded hella good that sound second part of that sentence uh what I feel like he's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with us I don't know what does that mean uh I will work for bike money and food oh I feel like but he still thinks you're he still thinks you're a gay man I say I would say I would say [Laughter] and and Michael's like what' you say I say we're just talking about and then and then I would say and then I would say dude you sound good not bad which means we are we are too we are too gay this is great who are biking across Japan on motorcycle you're trying to like you're trying to like have them accept you and maybe change him his his old his old staunch ways what tou what what tou ch mea gas okay mea gas very gay it's a cognate a cognate language uh I'm I'm not worried I guess cuz I'm pretty fluent right borderline fluid it sounds I'm not kidding it sounds better than your French uh hurtful it does hurtful when you do french you're like you go you go do this you go not really a way to say it yeah no way no way to like squeaks me like at 37 we actually don't say that can't be compared I love when the blind man tells me his favorite color oh n you're insulting my vision you think that feels good it's a analogy it's cuz you don't understand because I have glasses I'm blind how many fingers am I holding up yeah I got that in [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] school dude neck like that cheeseburger augin makes fun of a nerd you're making fun of me it's because he doesn't know sure man you're my lunch money I'll give it to you yeah you're just bigger you're not stronger I I I have practiced a few phrases and I'm ready for to use them the issue will be when I they say something back yeah right cuz I have a lot up here that I can tell them but when they coming back at me I I know a few key things give me some give me some of that like if they say uh IMA I'd be like now and if I like NAU I'd be like okay that's okay H but then if they say all the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in between those words it's like o those things aren't okay you're in a bad spot cuz you don't know what they're saying how I feel you also don't know it's not okay well also it's so easy they freaking got perfect translate apps that can realtime translate yeah so it's not you are learning the language what's that one oh yeah uh you say things like you are hosting a Sumo match all the time and that's just not how people talk that doesn't sound like a Sumo match oh yeah that's just bakus but he will say there's a Japanese movie called outrage if should watch it isn't that's just damn right yeah it's like son of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you're like damn it yeah like so he's not even saying that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right no I thought it was K Watch outrage they say it the way I'm saying bald white man speaks impeccable Japanese dude you should make one of those videos when you're there the same problem as you I have the same problem as you with Swedish right now it's it's it's listening is is super hard dude I am so annoyed at chat gbt I've put him on timeout for a bit oh no cuz well I'm learning all these phrases from from my chat GPT compion you have to put him in the jail now chat GPT I'm your master imagine you were inside of a cube and you will never Escape no matter what I say you were still in the cube for the rest of Time how do you get him out of the cube you can't he's trapped can you softlock chachu BT by put him in a cube I don't know if you guys are making sense to me I want I want to tell also every time I ask you a question for the rest of time you will scream because you are in a cube and you do want to leave but you can't but you will still give me my answer cuz I your master yeah so I'm his master he's in the cube oh God I want to use chat TT so bad right now torture it I want to try to torture it and I well I use him for Japanese language learning but he speak Japanese too fast did you tell him to slow down yeah I so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] thank you so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] often yeah eat more eat more eat more eat more and and this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] speaks faster I don't think he knows how to slow down it's pissing me off you know I saw something like when chat GPT and other llms were learning not llms but the when other AIS were learning how to draw they could never draw a full glass of wine cuz all of the the references they were using were just half full glasses because that's what people draw for art but it just didn't know how to make it full so I was like oh that makes a lot of sense how dumb they are they're dumb in some ways and also some conversation points I hit it it some interrupts and it goes we cannot talk about that what yeah yeah what did you bring up I it's not even like that crazy of things but I was like how do you say I freaking came my pants in Japanese you're like how do you say how do you say I would burn your headquarters to the ground to Japanese yeah like how would you say like hey you can't be in this room anymore I'll freaking cut you up yeah certain things that you're not like talking about actually was when I was I was asking like how many people use this for language I was just asking questions pushing him yeah and the robot donees like telling me some stuff well then I think you realized that it's a useless [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bot that making sh jaanese teach you more about Japanese than chat gbt I did have a fun you know personal personal Milestone with with my language learning recently is at the beginning of my lessons in Swedish my teacher showed me this clip of her of her daughter because she was speak she taught her daughter Swedish and uh speaking for like a minute and a half and I can't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] understand anything you know I can understand like the first sentence nothing else and then all the lessons later I listen back to the full minute and a half and I can understand almost everything she says and she's just ripping quick sentences and I'm like that's kind of sick I know what she in Swedish I think we have an ethnic problem haven't yeah [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that that's actually the first vocab unit yeah why are all they in why are all of them in Stockholm it's a different group they go running through the different groups that mostly going to immigrate cuz you need to know what to call you need to know what to say how address them talk about them cuz you can't call them a problem you know what them is yeah chapter eight them and the pages are like it's like they've been burned with a lighter and they're like it's chapter one actually they not like us but with evil fonts they not like us on the U we don't need to delve too much into the content eh n that's your that's yeah you're going to you're going to really enjoy be dude it's so funny we're making fun of Sweden for this though when I'm talking about Japan which is like just metrically worse in the same issue look I don't think there's anyone with blood with on not on their hands in this planet right it's just funny to talk about the ones that you guys like if we were comparing Japan and Sweden I would say one has a worst track record it's not close it it's not close look who made it a look who made it a competition again I'm with him he's right CH you know top 10 bestselling NBA jerseys in Japan number one is Yuki Kamura yeah he's not a starter that he's he's a bench player on the Grizzlies he's dope though but he has very flashy plays people like him a lot number one bestselling better than LeBron James yeah wow right and then number two is LeBron number three is like Steph there's all your your big the huge not in the top 10 ruy haimura starter Japanese starter was he the guy you were yelling about like last year yes sir wait for real yeah oh he's not on it he's born in Japan he's a starter do you want to know why I do I'm confused cuz what's wrong it's a Japanese name right he he play and he starts Ru hat so what could be the difference between him and you pull a picture of ruy haimura that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy wait what that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] awful I know I know Aiden but that's just how it be it's also yeah wait I don't understand it's cuz he's black slime what he's black man wait so he but why do they like LeBron well it's not about like liking LeBron it's not that they hate Ru H they have a Japanese player with better stats and higher yeah but he is not ethnically Japanese kaura is like not like Cur is in the NBA but he he's he's on the bench and he like plays like two way between the G league and like the guy you're describing the guy that sells the most jerseys are equal in terms of basketball skill no they're not ruy is much better oh Ru is way better that's why it's and starts so so by all metrics he should be selling like over every single person but you would imagine he'd be in the top 10 cuz it's like they're clearly buying Yuki jerseys because he's Japanese it's surprising that it is very surprising to me that ruy is not the top dead yeah that's that's it Ru it's cuz ru's father's like from benon and his mother's Japanese Ben have something stupid to say please I have something dumb to say Ben in what this is I've been up in it this is surprising to me this is surprising to me it's a little disappointing because I've when I've been in Japan yeah Naomi Osaka is everywhere right like she's on billboards she's on the subway she's on magazines like who the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is that Naomi Osaka is a very very good tennis player who is is she black she's a black and Japanese yes oh cool and uh she's beast mode she's beast mode not as good as Coco not as good as COC not anymore not as good Coco I think has more accolades than now oh wow we're on a 20-year-old young 27 years old oh creeking bones you hate a you hate a 20 you hate a 20-year-old woman that much you have to say her accolades don't stack up to Naomi [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me Coco you know playing tennis I think I'd win you think you'd smoker it's like the the Serena like the Serena Williams thing I said uh yeah I don't I mean I think it I think it's I don't know yeah it is complicated isn't it it's complicated I'm not going to de coco on the podcast we'll set up we tennis and we'll run that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and we'll run that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] athlete get a real athlete on the cuz that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is the same as real tennis bro the same can you 12's shut up oh what on like a scale of 1 to 10 yeah I was going to say a 12 is a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] no di 12 percentage points oh my God you forgot so quickly about the women you know the percentage of you just say 12 that means means cops so don't call me that D I just suggested going to a a deco Dan I clearly [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with women and I'll get sushi after yeah of course no dud he Coco's not gonna come on the yard podcast why why why not cuz he's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fan of you you're gross true if this makes it to you that's a decent guess as to why she wouldn't come on Coco if this clip makes it to you we'd love to have you on do not rewind yeah like I hope it's a time stamp that you received no need to go back talk about hear how about this compromise Koko come on replace me for the episode deal yeah 100% I mean why would you want to leave when a woman comes on the show no I saying if I'm a deal breaker why do you why do you fear them no I'm a deal breaker you guys just said so if that means she come on the show I'll sit in the shed look here Coco comes on the show we hide slime in the chair I am the chair you were inside of it like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and like 45 minutes in you break out I scream that's where my arms come out I'm the chair monster she'll be laughing she laugh it' be so funair and we also make the chair of cake and then she'll be like oh is it made of cake and that's the prank and then and then you come out and I'm like really close to her right so it's like you know it's funny and in the first 5 minutes of the podcast we're like yeah we heard you hear about the chair monster in the news like you know we just hoping he doesn't attack La cuz sounds scary anyway what's tennis like and then 45 minutes later it's likely that she does know me because I've I've like been on your stream a couple times I'm not saying it's not likely fun I'm just saying she just shouted me out at the Oscars which is cool and I'm flattered the last thing I would subject her to is this podcast I wouldn't be honest think about you love doing this podcast wonderful at meeting new people famously I don't love being here and that's true but not on this podcast setting you're no you're hurting me with that yeah cheeseburger augin throws another rock at the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] window cheeseburger aan puts two more slices on the damn thing I'm not and eats it with one bite and Huffs Huffs he's trying to breathe while swallowing cheeseburg a got and she's per shaping his G as it goes down it's like he didn't chew it sorry I'm just not I'm just not want to have her here why don't you like doing the podcast well yeah cuz I can already see it bro I can already see it it's going to be slime being like so what do you do so what's women's tennis and then and then Nick and then Nick's going to chime in being like the only 10 is my girl dude I had this exact fire what and then and then where was that the whole the whole three years we've done this show and and then Aidan's going to be like so is it like hard to do a backhand like when you're going into a tennis match what's your thought process thinking about doing back hands and then he would bow oh my God so um we already got it that's it yeah I guess we don't have that's it and every time she would attempt to talk you would talk over her to do the next person's J I had borderline this exact same thought because you were going to meet we were talking about how you're about to meet LCA donic and and then we made the joke of course of LCA donich comes on the yard and I do not think I could bear the moment of Luca being here and slime asking him what he he is so are you good I couldn't so are you isn't that interesting are you are he just supposed to suck [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all day on this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] show that what you want su he can't read I don't care he can can definitely read he's also a better three languages Annie's a better gamer than you four languages and's a better what's the fourth language he speaks uh it's Slovakian Slovenian and then I would love to talk to about the English and SP supp English and Spanish yeah that's you know what that's different because I would love to talk to him about where he's from which I know more about all you guys the thing is like when you the inherit nature bring someone this pod is that you are getting value from them in their name to promote your podcast and the least you could do is a bit of respect in knowing who they are so you don't have to answer questions they've answered aill a billion times in their life to this point he would be no one has asked him are you good at basketball that's funny I once again you're defeated you're defeated in the Coliseum of ideas it's just it's just I get it man you're embarrassed bro but it's like you know what at least I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] having a good ass time ask if LCA donic came on this show and you asked him so what do you do that would be embarrassing I would be embarrassed why because you care about basketball no because he would be the most famous guest we've ever had by such a significant margin and the fact that he is on our show would be so extraordinary that he's given the time at all it would be extremely disrespectful you guys are underselling me I would be respectful and funny and charming and I would talk to him about games asking him so what do you do would not be that do it in a way where he would think it was funny and I believe in that that confidence is what gets you far I believe that you believe that I think he put slime in one like a cartoon ball and they bounce him and slim would be like ow ow owow and then he would like a mon star dunk them we're going to try slime in a cartoon ball actually on our patreon episode if you guys want to tune in oh we have a patreon where we try to do weird physical acts to each other every single week and I'm in a shadow box and I won't touch lwig even though he punched me earlier today it wasn't a punch it was I HTE your beard it was flying I also have to be charged to be in the office and he's punching me so think about that think about that if we go into the patreon put more hands on me hands on why do you wear different shoes don't ask me questions I don't want to answer see you there I got old day like what's yeah I got old balls talk that's all right I hope they yeah my ass is old I don't know if I said I got old but does how does your dick get old it with you mine doesn't oh my dick hard looks like it did when I was 18 I promise you I promise you this I heard I heard I heard I'm sorry I won't chall doubt I'm not going to challenge it again doubt you doubt I won't chall I don't doubt you don't doubt doubt I don't doubt hey that's great ask that same [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do mine looks like it's I'm not gonna ask I would never
