Yeah, that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Spotlight. Great [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] movie. You think you think JD did it, man? JD Vance. Yeah, sir. He cursed him. I think he had spit in his coffee. He had like fentanyl on his hand or some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] No, he's just he's just a stinky, dirty, fat guy. And and the Pope's 88-year-old body couldn't handle JD's just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like cheeseburger stink. That's what did it, bro. He got He showed up with a big lollipop and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like crack like butthole underwear. Just skidmark grease on his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] underwear. And the pope was like, "Hey, how's it?" It's like a Tom and Jerry when you smell the green stench and like you like all your eyelashes fall off. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe it's the opposite. Maybe you found JD breathtaking. I'm sure he did. He saw JD and he thought I can die now. JD showed up. I've seen most breathtaking man ever. JD showed up and then he looked like the Pope looked like Spongebob in Standy's house when he doesn't know that he needs water. He did. Rest in peace to the Pope. By the way, Rest in peace to the Pope. Sorry respects. Sorry that our nasty vice president did you in like that with his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dirty pit stains and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hate that guy. The Pope. Yeah, the Pope. Look at that. Oh, okay. Okay. Wait. Hear me out. He lowkey looks good. He looks the Pope for his age. He reminds me of what's his name like Prince Andrew. He looks like he's 88. You know what? He's an old guy. What confused me is he died of double pneumonia. I didn't know you could have a double. Oh, is it too long? He got the two times from JD. I would have got It's not like it's twice as much. That's what I thought. I thought he burger pneumonia. He got burger pneumonia. Sting pneumonia. Look at that chain on the Pope. Okay, that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] goes insane. Yeah, imagine Lil Uzi with that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on. JD pulls out the diamond tester and instantly kills the pope. Uh, wow. Bro, what happened with Swift, bro? Yeah. Did he splatter everywhere, bro? He He [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so much. Yeah. Yeah. You were like, "I'm going to I'm going to be late. Swift [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in the house." And then you were 40 minutes late. How much poop? Think about that. He did. He did that on me once. What was the context of that again? Oh, yeah. When he you carried him. Yeah. Well, he it was like that. It was Cutie woke up at 6:00 a.m. cuz Swift walked on her face and it was wet. And she's like, "Why is it wet?" Oh no. And then you open up the bathroom and it's and it's poop nightmare. Might have been pissed to be honest. We don't know. So Swift just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. There actually isn't much of a difference between that dog's pee and poop. He literally [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pissed and threw up everywhere. What did he eat? I don't know. We don't know. We don't know what he ate at a bunch of red 40. He must gummy worms. He didn't even eat anything. He just heard about the pope. Yeah. He was just worried sick. He was worried [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sick. That dog's devout. He said, "Who's going to take up the mantle now? Pope Francis was so good to us." Maybe Satan resided in Swift and the Pope was the only thing keeping him at bay. Or maybe when the popes died, his spirit went in Swift. It was It was poop for poop for the pope. And they're all going to start [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and pooping. Poop for the Pope. Suck it till you can't, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] For the Pope. This is a reference. No, I just I like it more. I was like, "Yeah, no." I just like, "Suck it till you can't, motherfucker." I don't. No, I got The voice is what's throwing me off. It is. It kind of came out of nowhere. Cat Williams or something. I don't It's like Yeah, that's Yeah, I love the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pope. You see what I'm saying? Now he's leading into it. And then me and the Pope put one blunt in rotation. What's that? Pope. I have a question. Is the Pope still the most famous person alive right now? Now for now he's peeking. You said you you had a key operative word there. He's not alive. He's dead. Oh, you did say alive. I did. So, it's a trick question. Well, the answer is no. The answer is no. So, is the pope the most famous person alive as soon as they pick the new guy? No. Cuz most people have heard of the old guy and the news hat won't travel. Do they get that new uh black pope? You know what's crazy? It's just an interesting followup to the old episode. Nobody knows. Bad example. Reopening the argument and then trinkets later. Uh Uh uh it's like it's like if there was two streamers named Sketch, but one had like two views and one was Sketch and I said, "Is Sketch still a famous person?" It's like we know who we're speaking. Sketch is also dying. We need Pope Francis and that's that's understood when you say the Pope, right? You can't just use your your your syntax [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] syntax. What I can't use. You don't even know how to read a book at home. I don't know. I do know how to read a book. You make my life a nightmare when I turn over it. Dude, Aiden does this. Okay. You know what's funny? What do you mean? I I don't like You're about to describe it as as if I do a thing. That's the thing he does right there. That's what I do. That's what I do. I I said Aiden and you could start going like courage when he's scared. I don't do you know what the thing you do is is the thing that you're doing. He does a lot. He does. To be fair, he does a lot. But we don't know what he's going to bring up about you. It could be Aiden loves to message friends that he hasn't talked to in a while. You do love to do that. You think he's going to say that? Do you not love to do that? I do do it. So perhaps I'm saying what you were going to say. Let's give him a chance. Love to thank you Lwig for the floor. So Aiden does his performative reading [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I know. Unlucky. To be honest, unlucky cuz I really thought it was going to be the first one. It's so unlucky. You didn't think that lying. I know you didn't think that. You guys ever go to I hope he poops on your face every morning. You guys ever go to like a bar and there's like the most beautiful woman you've ever seen and she's just reading a book. No, I think it's guys. Guys are performantly reading. Like some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] handsome piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Girls don't read books to pick up guys. Girls just read books to pick up girls. Oh, that's And that's what he's doing. Yes. He's trying to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You're the worst part of it all. He's trying to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] someone in the office. I think it's Otto. Otto's a good pick, honestly. Darkhorse underdog. Kelby. Um, yeah. Yeah. You know, cuz he But here, well, here this my got mad this weekend when when Kelly brought his girlfriend to the office to watch the basketball game. I was like, I thought this was our time. This my shift review. The book was 200 plus uh pound men. How to treat them right. So, it could be could be anybody. Could be me. He's eyeing over here. Treat them right. And it's Lwig. That that awful picture of Lwig on the cover and it's anamorphing into a whale. Yeah. So, we It was actually funny. The four of us were hanging out uh outside of the show and no one else was around. And also, it's actually extremely No one planned to meet it. It happened. Just It just happened. It's It's been a long time coming. As sweet as I find it, it lowkey doesn't count at the office. That's stupid. It's just an accident that we enjoyed. Yeah. Yeah. But I think it's it's fine. It's cuz it's like it's it's like if we were back at the old old house with the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the glass doors. Yeah, we just had to be there, right? True. And it's like we kind of just have to be at the office cuz that's where the things we want to do are. And we just all showed up. There was literally no one else but the four of us. And and to be fair, I it's not also like I was doing something else at the office. I was just hanging out watching basketball. Dude, I went downstairs that same day cuz you know when love was like, "All right, I got to go." And he left. He went downstairs and played Valerant offline. That's didn't stream. And I walked in and I was like, "Are you streaming?" He's like, "No." And he's like, "I couldn't think of anything." And I was like, "You're just playing Valer?" He's like, "Yeah." When I was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's what you were doing. I thought he was streaming. No, I was crushing Val. You were talking on the mic. I was literally popping heads. Were you playing with someone who was streaming? Yeah. Yeah, I was playing with It was like uh This is crazy. He wasn't streaming. Me, Ryan. So, he said, "I got to go." And then didn't leave. Wait. Well, I said this, too. You might have missed it. You said you had that whole phone call with him upstairs. I was talking about doing I thought you were just popping in for funs and giggles. I was going to do one game and then I decided to keep playing because you know what? I fragged out and I found that that game's easy. Valerant. Valerant's an easy game. Yeah. Compared to Magic compared to League of Legends, right? Oh, Real Man's Game. You should do It took you years to not hit your goal in Valerant. Wow. And and and you know what? And it's like I wouldn't go there. Just when I thought I was out, he pulled me back in. You played for years. Yeah. Well, I was still going to hit it. Did you get Did you get close? I got I I technically did hit it. What do you mean you technically hit it? Not even technically. Technically, yes. By definition, didn't hit it. In a technical sense, I hit it. How's that? How's that? The goal was diamond and I hit diamond. Did you? Yes. Did you win a game in diamond? No. Oh my god. And they didn't put it in your Dorito back then, right? So I'd never I don't have the proof. Wait, so you I didn't know that you actually achieved I didn't realize you hit it. Oh, I Yes, I have achieved diamond and then lost diamond. You got to diamond one for one game. I like ranked up to diamond then lost diamond. But there's no proof. And no video. There's no proof and no video. A streamer. A streamer. A guy. A guy who once said, "Oh, catch me dead playing Valerant offline." Yeah. Has no video proof. I I have no video proof because said slurs. Oh. Oh, wait. Yeah. It just dawns on us. Uh, no. I I actually I think I played a lot offline then. I was really into playing offline cuz I play a lot worse online. Yeah, cuz you crash members only cuz chat it can be annoying. Yeah, they they they tell me. But instead, I was just reading Ray's chat. They're not even mean to her. Even though she's bad. They don't even know what Valerant is, bro. They know what Valerant is. They're just going, "Your hair looks [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] awesome today." You I've I don't think you've ever watched a woman stream. What? Name one. Name one that you watch stream. Go. Uh, Night Sinclair. How? Night Sinclair. Who is that? I don't know that. Yeah, she she's a streamer who's turned to social media manager. She doesn't stream anymore. Yeah. Which year was this? She quit streaming. She does social media for uh uh forget the video game company. She does a good job. I think the crab game company. She does do a good job. By the way, quit streaming like three years ago. I celebrate women. Is it up when I sent you by the way or just get ready there? Okay, look. We We he got off light. He He sits in the office and he pretends to read a book because he wants attention. We're all trying to watch awesome basketball. I learned about Tyler Hero. Yeah, tell her. So, you know, and he's non-verbal working on COD. He is. Yeah. Until Halo was on the screen, then I came right over. You did. You did like sniff the pie on the window sill. Formal crushing in 2025. I got to see that. Before that, Nick hadn't said anything for like an hour. And then you guys got mad at me without me saying anything. And then Nick from across the room said, "Yeah, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you, dude." Had to had to chime in. That was what broke this. I basically take any opportunity to pile on Aiden. It's just it's in my bones. I can't not do it. I I have a question. If I can't read a book in the office, where could I possibly read one that isn't asking for attention? I spend more awake hours in the office than at home. I know. Whose fault? Where else can you perform? I just think when we're on a couch together and I'm tickling your feet and you're reading a book and I'm watching a TV, it's like, can we not do something together for 5 minutes? For five minutes. The difference between time together and quality time together, right? Thank you. And when you're when you're doing something you want to do, Go girlfriend. No, cuz sometimes I like just coexisting in a room, but other times like clearly I'm looking for some attention. You were looking for attention. I think it feels like you can't do the things I want to do without making it something you also want to do. Like you can't just do it for me. I And that hurts to think about. I was enjoying my book. I don't want you to tickle my feet while I'm reading it. I don't even believe he was enjoying it. No, you were talking to him. Halo and Basketball were both on at one point on your phone. there. Lemonade tycoon cross fans. I want you to know this man doesn't even absorb reads cuz I quizzed. I hate you. Damn. This is not Danny. This is not Danny. He's on two micro details. One of which was in a different language. He I just asked him a couple of questions. Nick on the previous page. Yeah. And and and I'll give I'll just throw out a random. So you took the book. You went to the previous page and you quizzed It's s This book's about Wilner Hayan Cades, right? Of course. Who's went to high school? Who's a gay man who found a wife? Oh my god. It's true. And had sex with her many times. No way. Yes. It hasn't delve into that part yet. Well, you'll get there. Catch up. That's why you got to read. And and then with this this uh this man. Yeah. He was being uh for actually no erase the man. Forget everything I've told you about the man. You don't know anything. Forget about the man. about Woodro Wilson. Communist Party praised him and then a prime minister. See, you don't even remember what you read. You are kind of You are kind of AI generating a dream right now. Woodro Wilson, the famous communist. I realized as I was saying it, I was like, why the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] was Woodro Wilson being talked about? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, interesting. I can tell you, but I won't right now. I'd be bailing it out. He quizzed him on a detail. Aiden failed to say the details. I start jumping around like an animal. He comes in. The question is, what's the name of the French magazine that talked about Woodro Wilson after the war? And I'm like, I don't know. It was in French. It was hard to read. You love French. And what? That's where they serve drip coffee in uh in London. Yeah, he said it good. You can't get it anywhere else. They only give you Americanos. It's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Also, you were wrong. I asked him a French word uh word on the cross word and he gave me the wrong answer. Wait, would you crazy's Japanese is better than his French? Oh god, I actually believe that. I watch him. I'm like, bro is fluent. Dude, if I need to Your French sucks, bro. Dude, would I ask you so dumb? When I ask you, yo, how how do you say this in French? You always go and then make a joke. You literally never tell me. You never [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] know. You [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Now that I think about it, anytime we've put your French up against another French speaker, they always outperform you. Yes. Pokey mog you like crazy. First off, she did not mug me. She's she Okay. He's literally French. Oh, I thought you were literally French. You were literally like born and raised. Guys, I my fluent my French is fluent. If I were if I did tip to tip France, I would have a man drive me from the north tip to the south tip and suck me off while driving the whole time. That's how fluent I am in that language. How do you say in France? Suck it till you can't, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] And that voice doesn't exist. Say it in that voice. What's the French equivalent of that voice? I can do that. I can do that. I can I Suck it till you can't I want you to figure out what he actually says and then subtitle it. Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh there's no way. No, that's good. Feed the is their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I know that one. We don't have [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] It means a son of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I can't believe they don't have a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] That seems like it'd be invented by a French guy. It's more of like a colloquial. I mean, they do [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Yeah, it's kind of like when you watch when you watch a Spanish TV show and they're ripping pa all the time, but then they it translates into like four different curse words in English depending on the context. Yeah, it's a beautiful context language. Was the origin of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] was it that you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] your own mother or that you were a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] of other mothers? I think it's the latter cuz back in the day that was like very wrong, but now it's like badass to do. Yeah. When did that change? When was it awesome to be a mil hunter? I think I think it was This is a biblical change. It's probably the fall of the church. I think with the pope dying, it'll go back. Uh well, it depends if we return to the church, but the Catholic Church doesn't have a big grip in America. We're a very Protestant community. Yeah, we like them [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] megaurch guys with a southern accent. That's a Protestant work ethic. I've been thinking about taking action against Protestants. That's something you should say. Yeah. What kind of action? Violent action. You want to stand by that? Maybe. Is it violent? I made a mechanic. You want to take violent action against the Protestants? No, just act. Violent. Violent. All right. We could take It could be peaceful. It could be violent. Who knows? English undertones. I love leaving it up to uh to God. Whatever the church of England says. Dude, uh what was I gonna say? I It was one last thing about Aiden, but I guess I guess everyone's tired of that. I guess everyone's tired of making We were playing basketball with him. Yeah. By the way, his ankle's messed up. I didn't I played slow motion. He was playing slow mode. So you throw at rock on him. Oh yeah. No, my ankle feels great. 34y old Atrich. 34 34y old Atriarch decides now's the time because I I can only guard people who, you know, also go slowmo, aren't are maybe also in slow-mo mode. And the way this has been working is I was guarding Stans at first and then Kelby because they both agreed to just play slow paced in a way that wouldn't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up my ankle, which I appreciated cuz I wanted to get out. But then Atriarch, it's his turn to step up to the plate and he starts going as hard as he can. He's blowing by me for the first time in his life because I can't keep up because my ankle literally cuz I I literally can't take it. And he does this one move where he like, you know, cross dribbles, goes back the other way because he has gotten better. He kind of breaks his ankles. And then I'm like I I stumble. Oh, and I'm like, "Are you kidding me? You're trying to go into ankle breaker mode when my ankle is like literally broken?" You got gags. If I had a video if I had a video of that, that it would be the best day of my life. Uh, Zipper, can you pull up Anthony Edwards Ruy Hachamura game one? cuz uh whatever we're about to see is basically a shot for shot recreation as zipper to spell the most [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Anthony Edwards Ruy Hachimura game one uh so in this example uh audio listeners atro is Anthony Edwards young upstart NBA player Aiden is famous Japanese basketball player Ruy Hammora and this is from game one sodas this is from game one uh the playoffs You got it. So, you lost all your stamina bar. Oh god. And then just look what happens to Ru. He's number 28. Bottom of the screen here. Okay. Playing defense against Anthony. Dribbles back. Oh my god, bro. He fell down the way a baby falls down. Yeah, Ry Ruy's ankles got snatched and he sat. He did sit just on like criss-cross apples. Everyone looks to him and starts clapping so he doesn't know he's hurt. You're okay. He doesn't get the uh he doesn't get the dunk. If he finished the dunk that would have been a clip for years that that he he didn't finish a dunk. He got blocked which was huge. But anyway, this did happen to Aiden on the court by Atri. He's trying to put me on my ass. You I mean you were you stumbled and he did finish a dunk by the way. I can't jump. There should be like a like a like a brown vibration in the court. Like if you fall you poop yourself. Like a brown when you hit it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it's transferred through the bone. It's like bone conducting sound. You fall and you What if everyone is attached? They have [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like explosive collars on their neck. And what's the how do you explode? And if you fall the sensor and your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] head blows up. Does your team just down a player for like the rest of this guy? This is who Adam Silver needs. This is who Adam Silver needs. This could ratings are down. I wish basketball with you guys. It was so fun. Yeah, but basketball ratings are down. It'd be cool cuz like you know if assuming you can never get more players on your team and if your player gets exploded then you just have less players forever. Maybe then you get to a point where like the Lakers have like 12 players and that's what makes them special. You can never fill that roster spot and so you just end up with like one guy. It's like it's like a battle royale and and you lose every single season and until other player he starts to push other players over and they don't clean any of you know who takes over who the wheelchair basketball players. And that's what Nintendo's working on. That's why they made the game. Yeah, cuz it's going to be all wheelchair players years in the future. Um, but at the court, I got pissed off at and I realized now it's stupid. No, couple of children. What? We were playing Are the kids who ride bikes to the court? No, it's actually this uh this guy we play with and he has a couple kids and we're playing five on five and then enough people left that it was four on four. So, he had his kids fill for each team. But one of his kids was so good. How old are the kids? Nine and 10. Yeah, but the 10-year-old's mogging, he's so good. The 10-year-old is mogging the nine-year-old. He was like, and and we're like, they're against they're on each other, right? They're like playing defense on each other, so we're just like, let like like let him play. Also, it's funny. You said the 10-year-old's mogging the nine-year-old. It's actually the other way around, is it? Yeah. The nine-year-old is mogging. So embarrassing. It's like the nine-year-old's hitting all the rebounds. He's stripping the ball. scored like like two or three buckets. Yeah. Like like very high kids going to grow up to be like an awesome musician. Maybe maybe they love to draw, but in our game we lost and if we had sw I literally thought about this. If we had swapped them, we would have won. That was the difference cuz they would have lost like the four or six points and we would have gained it. To be honest, it it was crazy cuz you have this expectation of you know his kids are literally this tall and you're like h well we'll we'll play with the kids. It'll be fun. And then the kid on our team just crushed. He was actually so good. And I kept wanting to after seeing my kid struggle go up. And I kept I kept like thinking I' I'd swat it. Yeah. And I kept yelling block by James. And then I was like I shouldn't. Dude, you should have you should have gotten mean. You push his dad over. I'm your dad now. I lose that fight. I might lose that fight. Casey bite. Is he bald? Yeah. His dad. Yeah. Yeah, he's got bald dad strength. Wait, Zipper 2.5. Zipper, bring up my my thing I sent you. Speaking of bald dad strength, last week on the podcast we said, uh, our strongest yard fans. Oh, submit photos of yourself to Reddit. So, I had I had Ben make a little presentation of our top 10. I haven't looked at this. I haven't opened it. He might have even messed up the presentation. I don't even know. I'm on the subreddit a lot, so I've looked at probably all of these and I have an internal top 10. And we'll see if I've only seen one of the pictures and I was like, that guy is enormous. Yeah, I'm very active in the subre and Discord, but have held off this week to be surprised. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. I want to look through if you just click through the first one. Uh, wow. Pretty big dude. That's a big guy. All right. Some of these also because when you look at the picture, you're like, "Wow, that guy looks pretty big." Some of them posted their height and weight. This guy is 6'4", I believe, 300 lb. Oh my gosh. Yeah. This guy looks like uh who's the lumberjack guy from Myth? Uh Paul Bunyan. Yeah, he looks like Paul Bunan. Yeah. Yeah, he because he's hairy stories. He's hairy all over but like clearly sh the most like amazing chest hair. Uh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm saying that's what I'm saying. Like he's very hairy. He's clearly ripped. He's clearly bulking or just stays in this way. It's a beautiful yard. It's like Montana or some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't want to say I'm looking at his penis right now, too. Yeah. What? That's nine. This if this is not This is my number one. This is nine. This guy is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] This guy's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] giant beast. So this guy probably weighs less than the first guy, but he is This guy's a This guy's like a lean 220. He's the thighs that we used to say Lwig had. Hey, we did used to say that. We used to say that all the time and now we know about% body fat, maybe less. He's got a full leg tattoo. He has a yard logo in the mirror blocking his penis. Tasteful. That is very tasteful. Tasteful block. Uh yeah, very strong. Very ripped. All right, let's see. Number eight. I wonder if this is ranked. Damn, that is That's a lot of plays. That is a woman slime. Yeah. Wait, there's a video. Shut up. I think that's more than I could definitely. I was going to say, we got the vid. Uh, wait, wait. Someone This is This is a little sus just because they graphically imposed the the logo. Okay, people have done that a lot. A lot of them are going to be doing this, which I don't like as well. It's probably because they wanted to post like their strongest moment and she already had it and they and they didn't all just have a yard squad. She's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] massive. She's deadlifting way more than I ever have. Sumo deadlifting, a number I can't calculate cuz all the weights are different and my brain's not You know, this made me think of the amount of times people say like, "I was listening to the pod in the gym and I almost dropped the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bar on me." It actually makes a lot of sense now. I mean, I only listen to podcasts in the gym, so I get you podcast listeners in the gym. Drop it. Drop it on yourself. Yeah. If you're benching right now, you're going to fail this one. No. Come on. Push. Push. Dude, by the way, I can't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] have him spot me. It's so goddamn annoying. He He'll just say some Yesterday was it was not that bad, but when Ludwick is is spotting you on bench like, "Yeah, yeah, you got this. Come on now. Give it to give it to Daddy. Give it to That's not at all what happens." Slime Slime is a bad planner and he shows up to workout chess, but he doesn't check to see if anyone's there to spot or ask anyone ahead of time. And so he just comes up and he goes, "I need a spot now." And I just got my food. And I'm like, "Can I eat my food?" And he goes, "Fine. Yeah, fine. Eat your food." Fine. That's fine. I guess eat your food. I'm I'm in zone one, so now it doesn't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] matter. And I'm like, "Okay, well, I I guess I'll die." He walked upstairs. I went to the bathroom and I walked or I got the food. And I walked upstairs and he said, "Tell Lewig to come spot me." And I was like, "Okay." And I I go upstairs and Lwig won't do it. You came upstairs. The first thing you said was, "You didn't even tell him, did you?" And I was like, "I did. He just doesn't want to." Which is disgusting. I didn't say I didn't walk to. I I asked if there was weight on it and he said there's no weight on the bar. And I said, "Well, then he's got it. Let me finish his food and I'll go down there after." So that's what I do. I go down there and Simon's like, "Yeah, I want to try to hit this for six." And I'm like, and he starts rip repping it. I'm like, "He could do more." So So all I do is I go I go, "Yep, lift it up. Big push. Big push." Which, you know, he loves. And then it's just distracting. And then I can kind of tell how many are left in him. And it's usually higher than he thinks. He underestimates himself. So I say, "All right, two more." And he does it. And he does. And And the first two sets go great. And then the third set comes and he's flying, Nick. He's flying. I was not flying through. He's benching 135 like it's air. And then And then I'm like, "Yep, keep pushing. Three more." And then he starts laughing. I was like, "Three [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] more? Are you kidding me?" Like three is the most ridiculous thing to ask. It was ridiculous. That's a normal thing for a spotter to do. Three more. I could [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] easily curl the three times if you needed. So just go for the three even if you're doing less weight. Oh, cuz you'll be there to help me. Yes, that's the whole point. If I I don't trust them, I think. See, that's the thing though. So then don't ask me to spot cuz either I'm spotting to make you do things you could never do without me. I thought you're more there to stop the weight from crushing my neck. Who gives a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about that? Oh, that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] doesn't matter. The rack does that. The rack does. Yeah. Worst case, you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fail and then you roll it down your body and you have a couple bruises. Yeah, but whatever. That's fine. You get a spot. You set the rack up to just it just falls on bench. For bench, it's a pin. You have to set it up on the inside and then pull it out. But then because you do that, it's like if you want to take it all the way down your chest, hits the bar before you get it. Anyway, yes, you should stop a limiting yourself to a lower number when you have a spotter because that's the whole point is you have a goal plus two usually. Oh, so you hit your goal, then you do two more. He wasn't around to tell me this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I was learning now. I'm learning now, guys. All this talk about adult toys and I have an adult problem. Really? That's true. Yeah. What do you got a problem with?

Okay, look at his butt. Come on down. Pops out. Pop out at your party. I'm with the gang. Those just seem dangerous. Um, everything's dangerous. I mean, I don't think he gets to do 405 without having done every weight between that and like 10, you know what I mean? So, he's probably hella good at them, but Uh, is that it? Are there more? I feel like it is. I'm just getting absolutely out of class. Last one. Okay. Well, thanks, guys. Who's got a winner? We have to give one person the winner. I feel like it's uh Yeah, really quickly go back. I I would give it to 1500 lb overall lift guy. Yeah, that guy or that guy. Wait, are we going Are we going by physique or I mean, most of the guy who posted all his lifts. Yeah, I agree. Yeah, it was comprehensive. He gave wellrounded and he looked great in the picks and he's bald. Damn, which I think is valuable, important. It shows that people with a disability can really make it in this world. I love entering all the bald people in the Special Olympics. He's been bald since he was 18 and he's coming up on first. He's just beating some poor [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] actually disabled people and they're like, "Yeah, I don't know. Rules are rules. It's the ringer and he just wears a wig. I do love all our strong yards. Yeah, shouts out. If you're not a strong yard, let that maybe be a blowable. Maybe next week's for you. Throw it back 30 next week. Who got that subreddit if you're the weakest yard? Post your lack there of games. Someone did this. It was someone. It was She was like barely hitting the bar. She was benching the bar. Yeah. And she was like It was I think she's the weakest yard again. that isn't a child. Can Aean outlift you? And then you post your stats and then Aiden goes through and he goes, "Yeah, I could do that." Maybe this means we have to go back to the gym, man. Are you You're fresh out. I'm back. Yeah, me and Leslie are back. All we do is work out. You're not back. If I go down right now, I can bench 205 for six. That's so much lower than what it used to be. But it's not bad. Good enough is the word of the day here. I'm happy with it. I mean, it's higher than me. relatively happy with this. Bro, I was I was working out down there and Aiden comes down for some dumb [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and he's like he starts walking down. I'm like, "All right, who wants to get nutted in?" And then Aiden's like, "Dude, don't you can't say that." And I'm like, "No, yes." And he didn't answer me. And he's like laughing. He's like, "I'm going to go take a shower." I was like, "Oh, you want to do it in there?" And so, and he said, "No." And I'm like, "That's gross." Then I showed up and he goes and now angry off of that interaction but I don't have that context. He goes to me and goes do you want to get nutted in which I was like he does and I was like crash slime from the bathroom and then then he yells from the bathroom like don't let him talk to you that way. Don't let him nut on you, dude. And then but you know what he said? He came out of the bathroom and he was like, "Oh, so you just tell anyone that now." And he's like, "It does make it less special." I had to offer men something special. But you said no. No, but you just hand it to the next flu. I do not understand. I do not understand women. God damn it, dude. I don't understand women either. I've been trying to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] see Ter's penis all damn week and he's blowing me off. Yeah, you've been talking about this. I know. Is What do you think he's so worried about? He's Turkish, bro. He knows what a bath house is. We did the Red Bull 5K, which was hilarious because half the people who came have never run. They just got into running. What was the roster? Did everyone finish? It was everyone finished. Yeah, it was me, TK, Leslie, Abe, Broadden, uh, and a couple other people who I'm forgetting. God bless their souls. Ellum, uh, and, and like Broadden doesn't run. Yeah. But I have like I have the watch because I've been running a lot. You don't have the watch. So clearly you run. I I Please. What zone we at y'all? And I I go up and I'm I'm bringing up zones. They know what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm talking about. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] And so Bron's at the front of this pack cuz it's a Red Bull 5K with a bunch of Red Bull employees. Uh and he's at the front of this pack. So I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sprint to catch up with him. And it's he's at 8 minute pace. He looks like he ran track in high school. He does. So I was like I was like, "What's your routine?" He's like, "What? I was like like how often do you run? He's like oh I don't run. And I go okay what's your workout? He's like I do it a few times a year. But he's on eight minute pace. He's on 8m minute pace just crushing it. I mean his stride and his that's his stride's a little busted. His stride is two for oneing me. Like it's genuinely mogging. He's got big legs. 63. Yes. And so we're running. We get about halfway. We hit this park and he and he's kept this 8minute pace. Like he did run a 830 mile. Uh, and then and then I'm like, damn, this is this is great. Like, I'm going to PB my 5K just sticking with him. And then he's like, okay, I'm going to stop. I'm going to throw up. Oh, it's like what? Yeah. You get a little uke out and you get you keep going. But it's crazy cuz he was talking fine and then like the wall hit him. That's so funny. He just pushed it as hard as he could. He just pushed it. Yeah. There was no pacing. Badass. I think that's what happens to a lot of runners. You don't know how to pace yourself. I don't even know if I could do a 5K right now. You could do it. or the question is I'm saying if there was a if there was a minimum time like you know what I mean like I could obviously do it and finish. I think the I think a rough goal I couldn't do a 5K without walking or going to a slow jog at a certain point. I think a good goal for a 5k of for someone your age is like 30 minutes well like it'd be different for you. Uh let's go. I can I am more in shape. I am not the butt of the joke. Oh my god. How How many miles is 5K? I would say 3.1. I would say over like 27 to 20 is like a is like a Oh, that's not a bad time. Minutes. Yeah. You have like a 9minute pace or like a 9 minute 15 30 second. That's why I think sub 30 is that cuz sub 30 you have to have a 9minute mile at least. Oh, it's over three miles. Yeah, it's over three miles. Okay. Okay. Okay. So sub 30 but I mean 27 would be great too. I the only reason I some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dumbass haircut. It was a little longer than a 5k, but the pace was good. 8:30 pace, right? Yeah, I did like 28 minutes. You can come for a little little old Ammon's record, dude. What's Aiman's record? 1850. What? [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Wait, you're nasty. What? You're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nasty. And I was getting washed. 1850. So you just ran 6 minute miles back to back to back. Yeah, but there was kids in my Dude, there was kids in my state running 15minute 5ks in high school. That's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] So they're sub fiveminute pace. Yeah, they were sub people were sub five. the entire time. There's a few kids in our district who were running 5K times that started with 14 minutes. I ran a mile this week and I did a six minute 40 second miles. I guess what's the the test called where you'd run two miles? The pacer test. Is that what it's called? The Grand Pacer test. I think when I was when I was on a soccer team in a kid, I did that test in like I think it was like 12 and a half or like 12:45 or something. Yeah. Wait, you completed yours as a kid? What do you mean? Ours was like a knockout. A knockout thing. Grand Theft test isn't supposed to end. Oh, our ours was just like at a soccer practice and it was like run 2 miles under this amount of time. I think the max amount of time was like 13 or something. Oh, that's a different thing. That's a different thing. Okay. Okay. I don't remember what it's called. But now, dude, I couldn't even get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] close to that. That would take me like over two years of training, I think. No, no, no. You actually get it back quick. It's like a 6 and a half minute pace. He said you get it back quick. Oh, the two mile. No, I think you do it cuz I in under a year. Yeah. I'm right now if I had to guess my mile time and that's one, right? If I do multiple, it gets worse and worse. Probably like 95. Yeah. No, probably. You're faster than that. I'm faster, but not over. You just get so gassed. I would get so gassed. But if you But in a month, it would go down. I would run a short distance pretty fast. In a month it' go down to like 750. Yeah, I think that would 750 maybe. I think you get you could you drop it heavy if you run consistent for a pretty like a few weeks. Especially if you used to run the yard fastest yard again contest. We want to see how fast you are. Surely we have like a collegiate athlete who's I would love it. I would love to see how fast you guys are. We saw strong. Now we want swiftness. Let's broaden this. Just show off your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] world record. Oh yeah. Whatever. You have the best yard Olympics. The yard just But it could be anything. Clock tower time. It doesn't necessarily have to be physical. Like I would love to see if someone can do a Rubik's cube in under 5 seconds. Sure. The yard talent show. The closest you are to a world record in a category. Oh, dude. Reddit thread. begin the Reddit thread. Uh, auto auto came up cuz he's he started playing Neon White and it's like a shooting game with like times in it and it tells you all your Steam friends is times. Oh, right near it, which is kind of nice cuz you can like you can message them and they haven't played the game in two years. You're like, I beat your time [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You loser. Yeah. And and auto is just go I had I grinded that game so I have like all the highest times on his friends. Yeah, it's great. And he's like messaging me. He's like coming after your time. Coming after. I'm like he's like beat this one. beat this. I'm like, we haven't talked in like a month. Like, but I said I was like, "My clock tower time is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up." Cuz that's the one I grinded the most. I was like, "If you can beat that, then you've done it." And he he's like, "God," he messaged me with like he's destroyed my time like by a second, which is a lot. And he's like, "Yeah, this one took me like a day." He's like, "Your time is very good." And I'm like, "Dude, go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yourself." So funny. He destroyed me. I didn't even know he's good at shooters. Can't even rent a car yet, dude. Oh, it's not like a legit shooter, right? Like it's a PvE. You still need to have aim. Sure. Um I watched Alfred speedrun it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Alphared has a apparently a hidden account cuz people wanted to mo him so bad. So I actually have on my desktop. It's one of my old times. It just says [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Alpharad for a clock tower. And I was like, "Yeah, I'm the problem." Like you are what he is now. Like you're mad at auto. He he was you once upon a time. You were him. Except it was Randos. I had an awesome idea and I want I want you two involved and you're welcome to come too. Okay. Uh but I feel like you don't have interest. Okay. I want to join a wreck soccer league and I want I want to make the yard FC and we have jerseys. We come overprepared. We have jerseys and it's us and we're on a team and we we fill a whole team. Maybe we sneak a couple of my friends who are good at soccer onto the team and we we're a little busted. But we invite yard fans to all our games to cheer and yell at the other team who won't have any fans cuz it's a wreck soccer league. And we overwhelm the league with this fan energy and we go like 0 for 12. But we are like but we are like the loudest most cheered like like the richest wealthiest team. It's like Globo Gym if they sucked and we bring off our own ball and we have like a water we we dump Gatorade on ourselves after the games even if we lose. We could we could fly like a fan out who's really good at soccer one week and like you're a yard fan who's like on like a really good team. Oh, just play. You just play on our team for sure, dude. This the best idea ever, right? I'll do this. I like the idea of like me getting involved in another team in the league and like secretly shadow managing them. This is just the plot of Ted Lasso. Is it like what he's saying? Yeah. Yeah. Cuz now he's the villain. But that show becomes the hero. That show teaches us that it's okay to have panic attacks. It It's not that bad. It's not that bad. Like that's all I know is that people who are annoying like Ted Lasso and that it has that message. That is my entire understanding of the show. God, season two is horrible. It is really But season one rules though. So it's the severance of guy shows. It's so it's like the Dexter if Dexter was season one and season five. Five was fine. Six was bad. But then there's another season after that that that's okay. It's like season one if had lasso it's like oh this was a cool idea like what that's a I like the setup and American guy fish out of water and it's like Spongebob if like after season one they were like people really like when he says I'm ready.

I kind of say I've never noticed that Zipper has a text document called Zip. Really? That he uses for messages. And I'm assuming the thumbs up. And you know what? Keeps it open all the time. Mhm. I was trying to uh make my farts not smell like slimes cuz he has the special power. I pooped my pants. That's what happens when a rook tries to step to the plate. I was being vulnerable. I pooped my pants and now my underwear is dirty. So I don't have any other underwear and I need a recommendation of where I can get some. I'm not wearing underwear for a week. You can have What are you wearing? You can have mine. Are those What are those? I'm wearing some MeUndies with Those are MeUndies with llamas on them. Llamas are cute. They're not for you.

So, llamas, you were able to choose that. There was a lot of other options. the llama on so many No, you don't. They don't force the llama force themselves on people. Not in meundies and they do that. They're forcing themselves on another person. Is that a thing that happens? I've never met one. Not meandies llamas. Oh, thank God. Thank God.

So we after the 5K uh I got I was telling him about Wii Spa and all its magical glory cuz this is the day after we went. Yeah. First time I went to Wispaw and you loved it. Yeah, it was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dicks and balls galore. I was making the sauna crack up. He was a bit Did I tell you what he said in the song? All the old guys loving it. Yeah, he was Well, he was he didn't I guess we didn't teach him etiquette. No. So you guys took Slime out in public and didn't teach him etiquette. I'm like kind of walking him through just let him What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is wrong with Well, we I walk him into the entrance. You're supposed to take your shoes off. You gota baby leash this guy. And so I'm like I'm like you got I have I have a harness on me. I'm naked. He made a couple mistakes. First thing he did is he tried to walk into the changing place with shoes. I said, "Take your shoes off." Oh. And then he gets in and then and I said imagine it. And then you go straight to butt naked and he and he like tried to keep clothes on. I was like, "Take take it off." He's like, "I keep my shorts." I was like, "No, no, you don't." I didn't know it was naked time. It was naked time off. I didn't want to I didn't want to pop. He knew it was naked time, but he thought you waited for naked time surprise like right before you go in. I think safely. I don't want to like pop naked time when it's not. I think this is fair. This is fair. The first time I went, I also felt the same way. I have a theory. It's because most of the locker room is past the is like on the other side of the entrance. So you have to walk by kind of an open space to the lobby nude to get to the lobby. You kind of It just feels like she sounds like Lumen. Yeah. Naked Lumen. And then you go to the It's Mark when he's walking the halls of Lumen butt naked looking for Hel's clunge. Looking for a sn. And uh and and so then I got I'm like get naked now you shower and he showers and then we start hopping in the tubs and it's all fine. But what I didn't tell him is that in the sauna specifically people don't really talk. It's not talkie time. And you're you're making you're cracking jokes. I didn't start it. Well, I didn't. So we we hop we hop in and I'm in the sauna first cuz I go I go cold bath the sauna. It's my strat. It's a tried and true strat. And I you're supposed to bring in a towel. put the towel out so you can sit on the towel instead of the hot wood. Mhm. S comes in straight from a hot bath. A couple minutes after me, sits his ass straight on the wood. I didn't like that either cuz I I it felt hot. It's like the wood has absorbed some heat and it's a bit It's a bit yucky, too, because previous butts are there. Butts and balls and penises. So, it's like, is it common to not sit on the towel? No. Everyone's sitting on a towel. I didn't know. And I lost my towel. And how do you use it? I don't. It's a mean question to ask. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. and it's Sports Center top 10 and and we're making quiet conversation just quiet conversation and I'm I'm I'm following the rules which is really you don't talk a lot in this room. There's a TV and like like for example there's one guy sports center sports center you said that and so there's a guy in the front who's like he's like reacting to the clips so like a clip will come up and be like oh yeah he would be kind of loud like there'd be like a a baseball player catches a popfly and be like damn but that's it and that was that's fine to do in the sauna but Slime starts adding [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] commentary to it which is like he sees a hockey clip and he goes I can do that I can do that that's easy I can do that wait this is the best guy ever to have in this If he wasn't slime, you guys would love that that guy was there. He's doing it for every clip. He's always got something to say. Yeah. You know, it's like a Japanese or it's like a baseball clip and he's like, "But the Japanese would do it better." That's right. They mo us Japanese mugg. There was a a dog food ad and you guys and you guys keep going back and forth about whether or not deserves the fancy dog food or not. And you guys you guys are having having a loud conversation about it and I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm starting to laugh like I'm I'm covering my mouth cuz I'm dying laughing on the other side of the sauna and the guy next to me is laughing. I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we're killing bro. We're crushing the sauna. That's the thing is he gets away with all of it if he's killing. Yeah. If he's crushing then it's like done deal. He's breaking etiquette but he's crushing so it's fine. But like there's a university. You're talking you're talking so much [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] because we were in the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in the tub before the sauna and me, you and Aiden get in there, dicks out, wet, and we sit down and then me and Lwig automatically for some reason without any sort of communication immediately inhabit the characters of two guys who day trade. And we are just meeting Aiden for the first time. So we're just loudly telling Aiden what it's like to be a day trader. This is instant. loudly telling him what is so loud and how sometimes you just lose and but you just a lot of people think you should dump into gold right now. Wrong. Heavy metals, bro. Other medals that aren't gold that are big and you got to think about that cuz what are we going to need? Everybody is looking at us. I'm sitting there just like looking at us for advice. Looking to you like what's your name by the way to Aiden who we came in with and clearly know. Son, I'm gonna make you a millionaire. So, I don't I get all this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but Lwig wanted to run the day trader bit, I would say, more than I did. You're enabling him. This is in the public bath area, which is different than the sauna. The sauna is different cuz the sauna is a close space. Yeah, it's much quiet cuz the the bath area, it's loud cuz there's water and water. You can have a conversation. The sauna is a quieter thing. But you know what? If they didn't want you to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] chat about sports, then turn off the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] turn off the TV, dude. That is a conversation starter. Real real [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Well, look, either way, you had a great time. Yeah, it was great. And then I was trying to get TK to go cuz we did the 5K. I was like, what hits after 5K, but a wee spa? And he's like, he's like, nah, it's like dick out. No, I don't know about all that, bro. He's like, I can't even smile, right? I can't show my penis. That's what I said. I said I said crazy. I said what? What? It's It's penis. No. It's meat. You bring out [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ball. It's meat. No, no, no. That's so trolling meat out. That's penis for meat and sauna. Is it a girl like boy club or And so yeah, I bring this up. I say Turkish bath house. He goes, "Oh, I've never run that so I don't." And then and then his roots eventually like we leave with this idea that maybe we'll do I hit him up the next day. I'm like, "We spa"? He says, "I'm not ready." Like, "I need to warm up to it. Do you want to come over to my place and go to the hot tub?" And I'm like, and I'm like, "No, it's penis sour. I'm not interested. I'm not trying to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] warm up into the Wii Spa by getting in the hot. You should invite TK over to your house for a normal for a normal spa. I think the problem shows up. The problem with you're naked and you blindside him with no consent. You just And he shows a bunch of uh like different Korean men who are all butt ass naked like Craigslist Korean really really ease him into and then I say come $30 one hour come butt naked to my house dude cutie comes home she's like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is going on one of them looking in the fridge butt naked that's kind of what happened that one night at the pool at your place that's what happened that one with the goat with Mango. Mango's just rooting around in your fridge. Dick and balls out. He was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] balls. Mango DM'd me for the first time in like seven months and just and put in an asterisk whispers and then put we should get tattooed. He wants to go again. He loves getting ang which means that this will happen two years from now. Yeah, exactly. Dude, Schlatt message be back by the way. What did he say? I said take it back. Take back what you said. He said, "Don't worry. I was lying to Aiden. It's actually him." Yeah. A classic pin you against each other move. It was you the whole time. That guy needs to send me his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] W9. So, uh, so what? So, Derek is not going to come. No, it's cuz you're it's cuz of the way you invite people. You did this recent with recently with Ben. You go heavy. You sell it as if it's mostly about [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and ball. You're like, we're going to look at each other's penises and we're going to enjoy it. And and that's what you lead with. You don't talk about anything that's appealing about the spa other than the fact that you'll see your friend's penis, which isn't really the cell in my mind. But I do think, here's my thing, here's my thinking is cuz we spot I thinking rules. I think we all think this. Yeah. But if I sell the expectation that it's just penis seeing, then you go in like and then you leave going, "Well, actually, it's way better. There's way more. You should have told me about you should have told me about the amazing meal you could have. I don't even realize there was a spa and a they they have food. He forgets about that part. They have like Star Wars house and they end where you can go inside and it's very hot. They have seven saunas. They have yummy food. They have little library books. But but when I if they think it's all only penis and they get hit with the book, they're having a good time. You know what? And I will argue if you say, "Let's go to Wee Spa." And they're like, "What's that?" It's like, "Oh, it's like a spa." And you show up and it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] just full of you have to bring up the penis. This happened to someone I know. Oh, this happened to Diesel Derek. Was it I think the first time Diesel Derek Young or Aiden brought himself freshly barely legal Diesel Derek. I I think it happened to Alex, too. I think Alex mushroom. No, dude. There's just too many [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dicks, dude. No, dude. I'm not taking it on my or something. Yeah, Diesel Derek is the one who got or one of the people at least who Well, if you go in the women's, there's no dicks. Well, yeah, but then you are trespassing. Yeah. Uh, yeah. That's You have to tell someone. You can't invite someone without telling someone. So, I tackle it head first. I see. It's actually They build out the spot. It's like one of those anime episodes where it's like just a big rock wall between the men's and women's and then people take turns looking over and then [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] getting like Jeriah from giant sweat drops on their forehead. It's crazy. Yeah. It's uh I I was like, "Oh, I get it. There's so there's such a range of penis that you see there. There's such a range. And it makes you feel really secure cuz you're like I mean everyone's got their penis out. Do you think you go again? Yeah, I'll go again. Yeah, it's nice. Relax. You saw I saw the crown jewel. I saw the guy with the ring through his tip and I was like, I'll never see. That's it. That's the end game. Yeah, I'd be down to try at some point, but it's most meat. It's just like, you know, naked in public. It it's it's like a jump in the cold end of the pool and you get used to it and and it's only because Eve ate the apple. It's only because we have ate the apple. Shame. Oh, that's the reason it's shameful to do anything. Otherwise, you'd be happy to have penis out. I see. And you think twice about it. But there'd only be two of us still to this day. Yeah, but they'd be so comfortable. She gives you a leaf. A fig leaf. Much like Eve and Adam. I I I feel like Wait, actually that's kind of the towel, but a lot of people go leaf mode with the towel. Yeah, they do throw the towel on. Did they Did Adam bust down in Genesis? Do they have sex? Yeah. Don't Don't they famously bust down? I don't think they famously bust down at all. They graphically bust down in Genesis. I don't think they gra Well, perhaps in the book of Genesis. That's why Genesis are the stickiest pages. He's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] trolling with his sticky paged idea. I went to catechism when I was a child. They have the stickiest pages. Is that right? When I was in catechism, the pages Well, now the Pope's dead, so no one's busting down at all cuz we're closed until they pick the new guy. No, it's the Pope down. Pope down, bust down extravaganzo. You know about Jo and I don't know how you've lived this long without hearing it. He was like in the group chat the other day. Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth. Tell me that's not that's not a little graphic. But isn't this after the apple? No. Maybe it's before our heritage from the Lord. Dude, Bible's so boring. Pope died. I needed some heads so bad. Want to give me awesome head. Messageing a girl you like. Did you hear about the Pope? Sad face. I'm honestly really torn up about it. I was kind of close. So devout. I'm so devout. I think only head could fix this. Group chat would be like, "Yeah, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm a I'm a stream." in the JPO and I was like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is that? Just like Jack off pass. You knew this. You knew this. Oh yeah. Did no one know about Joo? I don't know about I love that. You stop J and P, dude. Yeah. Come on. Bring it back. You're talking about Jo. You're talking begging people to come look at your penis. I think he can uh he can chain grab chic. Give me a good Friday Jo. Did Zay hit it? Yeah. Did he? Yeah, he got it before the buzzer beater. For real, buzzer, dude. He had two hours left. He's a strong man. Wait, that's crazy. That's like a bigger buzzer beater than me plat hitting hitting plat last day. Uh, yeah. Two hours left is crazy. Every single character. Yeah. Wait, that was the last one? Yeah. Zay, if you guys don't know, he was trying to hit Grandmaster, right? Yeah. With every character on the Melee roster, all 26. And he uh he had to do it before the ranks reset, which was today. And he did it with two hours left. And his last character is a little bow. What's awesome is so many people are trying to snipe him. Yes. Like even like top 50 players and he like still got there. So many people Mewtwo King made a Bowser only account and then sniped him. That's so funny. And then there was like a bunch of gold chics trying to smurf inside There were like like there would there' be like a a gold Falco on the screen and it's like 3:00 a.m. and then [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] or it's like 2 a.m. and then over for Zayn it's like 5:00 a.m. has officially [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up the entire like who's the best of what character sheet because he's the best player in the world and he is currently at the highest rank with every character in the world. So now it's like, oh, who's the best? Like Samis, you have to be like technically Zayn might be top five. I think technically. Yeah, I think he's top five for every character. One of the best in the world. Fox, not Fox. Not Fox. He's the best in the world. He's top five for every character. If anything, he's even more the best in the world. He's top 10 at least for every character. Top 10. He's not top 10 Fox. He would be No, he's not top 10 Fox. Fox doesn't make it tough. He's top 10 with Falco. Falcon makes it tough. M I feel like he's not top 10 with all of the characters that get played. Maybe I'm a dumb brighteyed boy, but I think you give him a month with any character and he becomes number one in the world. No, Call me a brighteyed boy. I think he just Falco is Well, it got better, but it's bad. Yeah. Yeah. Old Falco Loic Jr. used to mess up. Kind of say we had that recent tweet went around about who would be the fourth on the puff, Mount Rushmore, and no one said me. Is that weird? Did someone mention me? Of course not. I I said that I I said that it's literally just the puffhart. Dale Hart Jr. It's the puff with the funniest name. That's it. Cuz no one else is there yet. It's King Mango Hbox and then the funniest name puff. The funniest punch line. Surely we just throw me in there. Blood. While at least while we're figuring it out has the biggest claim to it because he's like, you know, the guy the melee guy who made it. Oh yeah. No. Let me get on there like Andrew Jackson got on the 20, you know, slavery. Yeah. Like Well, no. I'm saying not because of the good accomplishments. I'm infamous. How? Oh, because your puff acquired the Louisiana territory. No, I'm again, you're honing in too much on the unethical stuff Andrew Jackson did. I'm just saying Andrew Jackson's on our $20 bill, but if you look at any ranking of presidents from any independent party, they rank him bottom 10 all the time. I know. So, it's like, how do he get on there? He's infamous. And I feel like my puff is infamous. I asked them this question the other day. Who is on your Mount Rushmore of people? Four people. Any four people. And it can't be someone and you're in a relationship with or a family member. Can it be someone I know? Yes. But it can't be a family member or someone you're in a romantic relationship. Carve out. No. It just gets rid of all of the like, well, my girlfriend got to be on there and it gets rid of it. Get Yeah. It gets rid of all like the well, if I don't put them, who what am I saying? Can it be someone I've had a romantic relationship with? Yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. My ex-girlfriend, my ex-girlfriend before that. My ex-girlfriend before that. Se dog the uh my Mount Rushmore of It's a hard question. People, they have to be alive. No, I had two musicians on mine and I was like, well, I'm wasting slots. They don't need to be alive. See, that makes it way harder than Carl Jacob. Carl Jacobs. And this is your personal. And if if the way you interpret that is like, you know, you put on the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] guy who invented uh sanitation, then sure, you can do that cuz it's like a big net gain for society. But it's more fun if it's just like personal personal. No personal the guy that beat the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of you in elementary school and taught you about consequence in life, right? He mocked me again if I put him on Mount Rushmore. Yeah, but now he's like dead. I don't know. He He died in jail. This happened to you. Uh, okay. Can it be a fictional character? How we all get to add one Rushmore? No. This conversation cuz David was begging to put Mario. How has no one made a Mount Rushmore of us? Uh, what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] does that even mean? It's just a layup. There's four white guys. He just put them on a rock. You just put us up there. I've never seen that photoshopped. Cuz Mount Rushmore is a collection of past guys. It's not four guys that hung out. By the way, the new trend is you make the Mount Rushmore the yard. Yeah. You make a AI Mount Rushmore. Yeah. And then post it on Dick Zordo and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Uh, I said I said what fictional characters. I was told no. So I'm like it was okay. Well, can I put I can put what about fictional characters that are played by like real actors? I'm like, can I put John Wick on? And then Nick said, "No." And then I said I said, "But you can put on Keo Reeves dressed as John." I said, "Okay, Keano Roose dressed as dressed as John Wick. That's fine." That's a horrible. And then I said And then I said, "Well, what if what if it's Mario, but it's Keano Reeves dressed up as Mario, but I say he's Mario Pratt." But then I said, "Okay, what if I did Chris Pratt dressed up as Mario in the movie?" And I can do that. That's I feel like it's a little existing. I understand not having fictional characters. Ultimately, this would just be having Chris Pratt on your thing, which would be embarrassing. No Chris Pratt dressed up as Mario. Still embarrassed. It's still Chris Pratt. It's still unfortunately it's still Chris Pat Pratt cuz Mario looks different than him. Dude, that's so dumb. What about Charles Martinet? We could all put our own dress up as Mario. We could all put our one person on. I know one. I have one. Tom Brady. Hey, he voiced the bomb on. I wouldn't put Tom Brady know that. What? That got cracked in 64. That guy who does all the 64 stuff, he was he if you replace Mario's voice line sound file, it also replaces the bombom sound file. What? So it's just a pitch shifted version of Mario. I did not know that. Maybe I would put Tom Brady. I'm saying you'd put Tom Brady. I think for athlete I might. That's your Tom left his family behind. Well, we got Now we got to put his kid on or else he's gonna have no one to kiss in heaven. Brady kissdy and his kid kissing on the M counts as one person on. I think Tom Brady would be the only athlete I'd put on. Yeah, Sakurai. Masa Masahiro. Sakurai. It's mine. Sakurai Chan. Sakurai is a good one. I just started watching his YouTube videos. Yeah, like the game design ones. Yeah, but not the nerdy ones. He does like just storytime ones. No, cuz I don't I'm not going to make a game anytime soon. Wait, so we're each picking one? You picked Tom Brady, you picked Sakura. No, I don't pick Tom Brady for this. What the hell would they even talk about? Tom Brady and Sakurai. You're so invested in how they hang out on the mountain. I like to think that anyone on Mount Rushmore is put into a special place in heaven like Toy Story or hell where they uh they must hang out for eternity. I like evil Mount Rushmore. The four worst people, the part underground like Yeah. Like you're making a ranking of the worst people in your life. I think it's too easy. Really? No. I Because Hitler's a Aiden. It's more like it it it's it would have to be more personal like your personal evil Mount Rushmore. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But if you like Hitler didn't commit a great if you did a real Mount Rushmore of evil people it it's Hitler what Gangghis Genghaskhan I don't know man like it's not that deep. You can't no one cancel each other for not putting Hitler on. Look, if Hitler's not on your main, you kind of need I'm putting Hitler on one of my rap mushs and I'm not telling you which one. I'll tell you what. You need Hitler on the evil one. Okay. I What if it's just five and Hitler has a permanent slot. So you just No one No one has to deal with No one has to deal with the question. Yeah. Of putting Hitler. Yeah. He just has I feel like he's not paying respects. Oh my god, bro. How about we make Hitler carve it? And he has to use like a forphice. Yeah. But every time he gets close, a rainstorm erodess all his work. Yes. Yeah. Um. Ooh. Do Greek mythological characters count? No. I would pick Jesus Christ then. Does Jesus Christ count? No. Why Jesus was alive? Yes, Jesus Christ does count. Because he's just a man in the sky. Oh, you believe the man in the sky. She's a madness. No, Jesus does count. I put Jesus [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Christ on my Mount Rushmore. Shut the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. You're so stupid. Jesus Christ. You guys are talking about the performative aspects of having the Mount Rushmore instead of people who are car I put Muhammad on because he was the last prophet. Yeah. And what is it? A big [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pixelated face. Yeah. It would just be blurred because Yeah. And Aiden's going through and he's like, "Yeah." So the first three you do Jesus and then Mohammad. You guys got that one. I'm not really sure. Put fictional people on. I want to put the tickle monster on the evil Mount Rushmore. Evil leaders. That guy scares the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of me. Okay, I knew gay test. Is this Is the tickle monster? Can we take the ultimate gay test? I get this ad a lot. Jesus, I just actually should not have a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] virus. Wait, wait. Let's do the uh How gay are you? What is your gay meter? Wait, hold on. Which one is it? Yeah, do gay me ad for the gay quiz on the gay quiz website. Dude, this is malar. Yeah, maybe not. Uh, who who's yours? You're Mount Rushmore. This is a bad No way. Bin Laden cracks top five. This is embarrassing. Yeah, this is a this is a uh I like how Hirohito seven Muhammad Muhammad at eight. I actually don't really know what he did. Kim Jong- Leopold 2. What an interesting Elon Musk. The new covers. Saddam. Oh no. These are like publicly voted I guess. Oh no. Ivan's got to be up there. Ivan's got pretty bad. This is crazy. I did blow up a hospital. Who hasn't top 15? We're talking all time though. Lenon. That's so interesting. I do think it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] funny to throw Elon Musk in there. Uh wait. Okay. Okay, so the hun is below Obama. Go back Dick Cheney cracking the go back to our Mount Rushmore. We have we have Sakurai. Is that evil people? Yeah. What about like Ted Bundy and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Why are they not kind of low? Are we only on [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like most amount of people? Is it really a quantity over I think it's amount of people affected? Wow. But like if Ted Bundy What did Ted Bundy do? Killed like 36 people. Eating their butts. Eating their butts. He killed like 36 people, mostly like women. But he was doing it's like he was doing it for the love of the game. He was, but you could argue Pot was also doing it for the love of the game. These guys actually were 100%. Believe it or not, all both UDub alumni potent loved the game, dude. He was he was in MC McMahon dormatory. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Yeah, the Mount Rushmore is hard. You start running out of spots. Who's yours? I was like Trent Resner and Josh Hammy because I like their music a lot which is like kind of lame and then I was like I couldn't think of anything else after that. You said George Carlin. Oh George Carlin because I read his books as a kid but that's also kind of like it just ends up with like the most read it like like is my Vinnie Paz. Uh let's see Ari the rugged man. Um let's see. Idea and abilities that count as one slug from atmosphere. God, I can't think of too many. That's how I feel about but as a tennis player. Actually, Red Fu is on mine as a tennis player, not a musician. That's your four. Uh I Well, when you first asked the question, you were like, "What, you know, what is sort of the representation of of yourself?" And I I think that's that's a nice way of phrasing the question to not make it so broad. Huh. And you put Muhammad. Yeah. Because he's the last prophet represents you. Yeah. cuz you'll be the last of your line. He's not allowed to put Here's why the fictional character thing is bad. Because he should be allowed to put Funky Kong on his boom. That's Funky Kong was a real man. Yeah. And he much like Jesus Christ. Much like Jesus Christ. He flew Kong from Counterstrike 2. I think we I think Aiden should be the new pope. Pope. I think he I think he takes any job he's assigned pretty seriously. Crucify. Then we should make him the pope. I've said this for a long time. Oh, that's not how it works. Tell me how it really works. Only my girl. Sorry. I I got a job offer and we It's like babe and it cuts to you. I'm busy. We've got to break it off. I agree with the idea of crucifying Aiden with nails and putting him in a steak and the blood blood. But it's we have such a strong vivid image of that in our heads. We all think of it. Yeah. And I hope that out there they think of it too. Mhm. Can I tell you, by the way, you guys don't know this cuz you haven't listened to Lemonade Sand, right? No, I have not. Aiden's the best member of that podcast. Really? It's And it's not close. Well, he Well, he was trained by some of the best. He leaves us. It shows. It shows his years if he's like, "Oh, uh, Chat GPT, what should I what should I say? What banter should I say?" Nick Ch atrich who atri all he knows how to talk. trying to look at a chat that's not there. Oh, yeah. He's like, "Actually, I'm so under stimulated." You're not too far off. They basically play a game of hungry hungry hippos with finesse ride pills while Aiden explains basically how the world works. Oh man, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] your show, bro. Yeah, we trained him up for 4 years and he decides to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] leave. Watching try to use the iPad as content, dude. It's embarrassing. He's the dumbest motherucker in the world. A tablet. I know. It's crazy. He's a bit old. We're actually I'm a little worried about our generation. So, this is a call out to the people. It is time to become iPad adults. Get chat GPT on your phone if you haven't or any AI software if you prefer Grock. Okay? Cuz you got to start learning how to use this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cuz in 10 years you're going to end up being like parents who are like, "Yeah, I'm not a computer person, dude. I don't you're going to be typing like this. I'm going to do it out of contempt. Just like my old man. That's what That's what you're like my old man. But like why? Because it's already really sick. All the stuff I use now is really cool. You know how like uh like have you ever seen those videos of like like college students pranking their class by like bringing a typewriter to take notes and it's like loud. That's gonna be us with keyboards one day where it's like comically loud to be typing on a keyboard and people are gonna be like, "Dude, like can you just use your monitor instead of your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] chat AI [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] jerking?" Pranking my class by bringing a red switches. Prank my class by using Google. Yeah. It's like, what is that? They're like, "Why aren't you just asking the the everlasting knowledge?" The everlasting knowledge. Ask Big Brother. He knows everything. Big Brother does know everything. Oh god. And he speaks only in memes cuz it's made by Elon M. Elon M. Oh, one of the evilst, Dude, honestly, rookie move. He should have made Grock just Elon and it's everyone asking Elon for guidance. We would have loved that. Oh, dude. All the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tech bros, they'd all be like, "Yeah, Elon knows everything." Elon, can you uh explain this? The lines would blur between the robot and him, and they would think his knowledge is the same as the robot's knowledge. You know what I mean? It gets [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] wrong all the time. And then people make jokes like, "It's actually not AI. It's just Elon answering every request." It's like, "God, it's like Bruce Almighty. like an email on his computer. I love that movie. That movie is fire. I rewatched it recently. Does it hit? That movie hits. I like when Jennifer Edison's boobs get huge. Yeah. Wait, they do get big. Is that one? Yeah. Yeah. I've never It's a scene. He's drinking the coffee and then her mind gets big and then doesn't top off or something or like the button goes like and he and he's like I watch that when I was a kid and his like beautiful wife is like I think they're just bigger. And I'm like, do you just get to talk about your girlfriend's boobs? Like, do you just get to do I'm a kid. Was Evan Almighty good? I don't remember that one. I've not seen Bruce and I've seen Ev. That's crazy. Evan Almighty's I played all the Luigi games. I didn't realize it were Mario. No arc. It's the Noah's Arc one. It's kind of mid. Ah, dude. You just make you just make Morgan Freeman some sort of awesome figure who's like better than everyone in a movie and just an awesome movie. I just watched uh Some of All Fears. Oh, dude. That scared the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of me as a kid. That was badass. I I I still I never just the thought of that movie. It's a movie about a nuclear bomb going off. Yeah, it's a movie about uh The sum of all fears. It's It's a movie about like the US uh it's kind of spoiler alert for the sum of all fears. Uh the US creates a nuclear weap nuclear bomb and sells it to Israel. And then Israel is carrying the bomb on a plane and the bomb gets shot down and the the bomb lands somewhere in the desert and does not go off even though it was dropped the way a normal bomb is dropped. You have to detonate. You have to donate it. Oh, I didn't know that. So, it drops it breaks open but doesn't detonate. Yeah. This is it. And then these random guys find the bomb and sell it to an American who tells them it's worthless but really uh knows it's worth billions of dollars. the the guy drops the bomb himself on Baltimore and then uh uh Ben Affleck is just a smart guy who like who like writes articles for the CIA who's figured all this out and he like studies Russia for a living and he figures all this out but no one will listen to him and he's trying to tell the government hey it's our bomb but the US thinks it's Russia's bomb and so they're they're on the precipice of war with Russia now and Russia's like well we can't look weak so we're going to strike back and then you know he he he buzzer beaters and gets Russia to to drop their arms. And then he goes to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Sentinels headquarters and watches Sentinels play. Did you see this? Ben Affleck went he co-streamed VCT, man. I saw I saw him hang be Batman and then watch Valer got it all, man. He [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] got Dunkin' Donuts and then kicked JLo's door down. That old Have you not seen this either enough? Yeah. No, no. This is this just a clip of uh him. No, no, he slammed the door. He slammed the door down. He He slammed that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] He just aggressively closed the door on his on sick [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Yeah. It's cuz they're going through a hard time right now. They are. Are they still together? Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Here it is. Here it is. Here it is. Dude, look how [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sad he looks in life. Every day. Like, what is Dude, he looks like a dick. He's so money, man. He's got the biggest dick. You got it. Oh, he's kind of I hope he's not abusing JLo cuz he is so money. Yeah, he's pretty like Come on, guys. Really? Have you seen my penis in the movie? Have you seen Gong Girl? It was the size of my leg. Can we just Can we just Can you just take Camera's Dude, I bet as someone who has gone to We Spa, I bet before that scene he uh he fluffed a little bit. I feel like they all fluff. He got like half. Why would you Why would Like you're saying this like it's a bad thing. Like you'd be stupid nonsense. I think it's I think it's valiant. Fluff. I think it's valant in a movie scene. Cold tub movie scene. That would be sick, dude. That'd be sick. Cuz then it's like you're just out there like you got this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] And then your next movie, your next movie, you reverse it and you go hot and go to the movie and they're like, "Oh, I I heard he I heard he like got he like trained to make his penis bigger. He jumped for the character. I jumped for the character." This is like that guy who was in the the Bass Pro Shop uh pool in the headquarters in the show store where he's swimming around in the pool naked and then he gets out and everybody's like, "Wow, his penis is so small." It's like, "You think that's warm water? He's got a tiny little penis." It looked really but like it looked more small than I think Mile would not if I water. Let's put you in the That guy can melt an awesome comeback though if he goes back to the same place and he jokes at a band the down time and he's got a massive dick and he said now talk about it now beating the Bass Pro Shop Sauna. Oh dude, speaking of that's what Terrick said he'd do. He said he would get rock hard before he went to Wii Spa. Like that's not the play. He said that. Yeah, he was like that would that's disturbing the piece. He is. I've never seen someone hard. It's a little It's a little strange that to be naked in public with an erection is noticeably worse than without it. Oh, absolutely. Even though you're not saying you're going to use it for anything. I did find out I have a I have a line on this because there's other Korean bathous in LA. Yeah. And there's another one that's apparently men only. It's a gay hookup spot. No. And a friend go to this one not realizing that this is the case. And it's the And most of the guys in there, they're there's a lot of hard dicks in that one. Wait. Well, like like while they're they're hooking up in No, I they might not be hooking up in there, but they're looking, you know, it's a little sexual promiscuity like like Li was attempted to be picked up once by a Russian man after we spawn. Yeah, that's Yeah, that's interesting cuz it's like it's kind of like a billboard. Yeah. If your hard dick's out and you're just hanging out in the cold pool, dude. You should get like a little like a little flag you hang off of it with your details like your head shot. That'd be efficient. Well, I can imagine going there and being soft and somebody tapping me on the shoulder and I'd be like, "But flag's not up on the mailbox. Don't talk to me." Right. There there is a culture of this. It's the the back pocket color. Uh Kirk Chief, this got to be 1980s rent [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Oh, wow. Say it with more contempt. Can Can you look up the zipper? The uh fig. This is the queer uh back pocket colors cuz we should start doing this round. Just turn around for us. He's got all of them. Oh god, what's orange? Hanky code. Yeah, you just go to Wikipedia. Surely the There we go. Uh god damn. That guy's like I want it all. Yeah. Uh keep going down. There's going to be a chart somewhere. All right. So, black is SNM. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Pause. Snoop Dogg circa 200 what? Uh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] eight. I keep a blue flag hanging on the back side only on the left side. Yeah, that's the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] side. Looking at this graph. Oh man. Snoop Dogg was looking for anal sex. Snoop Dogg from the album doggy style. Wow. And I rest my case. And I rest my case. Liberals, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kill yourselves. You're telling me it was You're telling me it was DEI the whole time? Wow. Mhm. Snoop Dog was an ally before anyone else. And that's what happens when you have the sum of all fears, dude. All the numbers start to move and I'm seeing it all for the I'm moving the pieces like Sherlock. Me just jamming 30 brown handkerchiefs in my back pocket. I'm Yeah, I'm just a demure yellow handkerchief guy. 70 yellow handkerchiefs. Like, yeah, whatever you want to do to me. I just really want piss and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Walking around with the scat flag is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] feral. It is. It's kind of brave. Homemade. It's a homemade flag, by the way. I don't like purple. I don't like piercing. Like, oh, I have one. Like, like, what is that? probably means you're really into it. Like you probably you know what it probably means you got a piercing if you like hanging out. You got you got your red hanky out one and then on your tool belt you got a pair of Hulk gloves on the other. I like how the like orange anything goes is the only one not hyperl. It truly is anything you can think of. Yeah, it's everything you learn at Harvard and everything you don't learn. They should make that a link on the page, but then it just rando links to somewhere else on Wikipedia. That'd be fun. A random link. Oh, that's fun. It just goes to Aquadine Hunger Place. Like the I'm feeling lucky Google button. Uh wow. Like fences. Uh yeah. Hanky codes. What if you're color blind and gay? Then you see anybody and and then you get you are constantly gray. You're constantly bondage. You can only do bondage assisting in hustler. You're just color blind. You go bondage again. Cody Schwab is is green color blind. He thinks he's getting into bondage, but it's just a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Oh, dude. No. It's just hustler prostitution. What are you doing? Stop pissing on me. Yeah. What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You're supposed to tie me up. He's like, "I'm sorry. I just I thought I thought I thought you wanted piss." Fetish gear color. Holy. That's such a cool sentence. That guy is Why don't we buy some fetish gear? Social media has lessened the use of hankies in cruising areas by digitizing the process. It's actually a good point. Yeah. Now you just go to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Grinder. You go to Grinder. It says everything you're into your game. Let's bring it back. Let's bring back going to a place. Going to the library with a hanky. You're just, you're literally just the now gay sex version of we need to be offline. We need to be offline. If John Maynard Canes could [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all these boys in London without the apps, then why do we need the apps? And then when I turn 38, I'll find my wife and I'll settle down. Let's go to the Los Angeles Public Library with Hanky in our backpack. Have you been to that library? Yeah, it's gigantic. It's so big. It's beautiful. It's a beautiful library. It's like six. You went to the library. I like going to the library. I enjoy it. I peruse. Do you go to the library? Yes, I have a library card, dude. Isn't that weird? Maybe you haven't read several books this year. You haven't read. You said that. It's okay. I've checked them out. That still let it helps the library function if you check them out. I support that. I never seen them support. It's good. Please. What is this? Yeah. When at the end of the year when they when they when they share their metrics for the amount of books they've rented out, I will be in those numbers. Can I use your library card, by the way? No. Why? Cuz it's not allowed. You're not allowed to share library cards. It's against the rules. Why? Because you need to sign up for your own library card. Just let him use it. It's chill. It's like a Netflix password. Yes, it is. We could share. No, it's fine. You let me use it. I'm going to go to the library. I'm going to say, "Hi, I'm uh Lewig Augan. I actually lost my library card. I'm here to 3D print a gun using the 3D printer." Lewig Aug. Yeah. Can I get a new card for one? You can catch the old one. And then two, I need to 3D print. Use your 3D printer for a weapon. For a gun, and it's only got to work once, but it's going to be an automatic rifle. And I only need it for one day. I will not need it after that. Never ever need it. I definitely will not need it after. This is really just a one time use. All right. Well, I'll even return it. Uh, tune in to the Patreon episode where Nick will tell us where he's going to use that gun. Mhm. I'm going to use a whole clip. Okay. Bye. I'm going to show you a clip of me using a whole clip. Bye. Okay, man. Why don't we get right into it? Why don't we get right into it? Why don't we get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] We'll get right into it. He put in You know what happened today? Right into it.
