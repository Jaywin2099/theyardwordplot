You sure you're all right in here? &gt;&gt; It's invasive to do what you do. &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, it's just you're doing it a lot. &gt;&gt; But invading me. &gt;&gt; I don't like you. &gt;&gt; You going to play some Valerant? &gt;&gt; I'm starting to play. &gt;&gt; You going to fire up some? &gt;&gt; You're doing it all wrong. &gt;&gt; I'm going to play Valerant. No, you got to put you got to put the head hole on your head. &gt;&gt; Put the head hole on the head. &gt;&gt; It's not all easy, is it? &gt;&gt; It's not It's harder. &gt;&gt; Making this weirdly hard. &gt;&gt; Yeah, just put it and then you turn it around. &gt;&gt; Oh, you're beautiful woman. Put on the Put your hair on the other shoulder so that the they can see your face. &gt;&gt; You You did somehow make it &gt;&gt; Oh, you're chic. &gt;&gt; Middle Eastern. &gt;&gt; I did. I I never &gt;&gt; the shirt. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he did it in a Maybe, you know, maybe I I also did it that way. the AI way. &gt;&gt; I was trying to be sexy. &gt;&gt; A generational hoing by the guy who's not here right now. &gt;&gt; I bet I bet if you're in your audio, you can probably just feel the weight gone. &gt;&gt; It's like, did you just hear the &gt;&gt; You just clicked play and your your car suspension just went up a little. &gt;&gt; You're like, what what's that about? Is there like more treble in this episode? What's something feels off, &gt;&gt; bro? You guys, I know. And you're probably like, "Who [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cares? Who the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cares? &gt;&gt; You know what? I care. &gt;&gt; I care, man. &gt;&gt; Who [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cares? He [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] said, we co planned it. He said 9:00 a.m. before your flight Monday after Fast 52 [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] event. He [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] messages at 8:15 in the group chat. Guys, I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] got too much [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm so sorry. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Can't do it. Can't do the pause. &gt;&gt; Oh, you're too busy for the podcast. &gt;&gt; Too busy for the podcast. Yeah. And I'm a whip dog because boy, when I saw that that boy's message started with the word sorry unprompted, I said, "It's fine." &gt;&gt; I was I was saying Aiden is the wife that gets the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] beaten out of her and then and then the husband Lwig goes, "I'm sorry I'm like this." &gt;&gt; You know what's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up? &gt;&gt; Usually I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. You know what's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up about that sorry is that sorry is only happening in a world where he still needs us to do something. Like he needs us to be okay with the fact that he's not coming. Cuz if we're like, "No, you're coming." He's now in a predicament. &gt;&gt; Oh god. That would &gt;&gt; It's not It's not like he [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. It's not like he [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. It's done. Right. &gt;&gt; And then he's like, "I'm sorry." &gt;&gt; He said, "Sorry, so I'll make it work for him." &gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I want to see the universe in which we just hold. We just all joined hands together and &gt;&gt; we're all here. &gt;&gt; You have to come, bro. You have to come. &gt;&gt; Right. Like an hour before this, I saw a tweet and it's it's Charlie Day on the set of the Always Sunny podcast. &gt;&gt; Did you That was cathartic. Oh my god. &gt;&gt; And he's alone and he's like &gt;&gt; when there zipper was not there, I was just like, "Oh my god." &gt;&gt; I was like, "Oh my god. Oh my god. Is it's somebody? It's another show." Who does that make Charlie the Aiden of the podcast for them? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Who am I? I thought I was Charlie. &gt;&gt; No. No. I No. Dead ass. I think Charlie's me because cuz Aiden wouldn't know how to turn it on and get it recording alone. &gt;&gt; Okay, that's &gt;&gt; Charlie's got to be me. That's fair. &gt;&gt; Sure. Okay, &gt;&gt; that's fair. &gt;&gt; Well, and then Lwig's Dennis aka Glenn Howton. &gt;&gt; Well, I've always in my head thought you were Dennis, but in the podcast I'm not sure. No, no, he's Rob Mlenny. Yeah, because he's such a &gt;&gt; he's the big Chad with the plastic surgery. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he's got the plastic surgery and he loves [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] soccer for &gt;&gt; your Charlie personality wise. &gt;&gt; And he has a trash bag full of food that he brings on planes. &gt;&gt; He does actually. Yeah. The garbage bag full of burritos that he's probably snacking on right now in like a $30,000 first class flight ticket. Dude, that's my favorite [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I was telling people I went to a wedding this weekend and that's why I miss Fast 52 and my favorite thing to tell people about Lwig is that he flies first class but he brings a trash bag as his carry-on. &gt;&gt; Oh, he but he also books it the day before. &gt;&gt; And he books it the day before. &gt;&gt; So it's at least five digits, which is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy. &gt;&gt; To France, which is where me and Anthony are going uh is it tomorrow? No, the next day. &gt;&gt; You're going tomorrow? &gt;&gt; We're going tomorrow, bro. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's Monday. &gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I want to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] go to stupid ass gay ass France, bro. I turned a corner last night. I also don't want to go. &gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] This sucks. Aiden [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bailed. All right. No, you know, I was thinking about this on the way here. &gt;&gt; Period. &gt;&gt; I was thinking about all the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Didn't I just enter the car? &gt;&gt; If you're a By the way, Slime's wearing chain mail. &gt;&gt; I'm wearing chain mail. So, so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happy. Are you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happy? I guess I look like the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Florence puke from [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Dune. I guess &gt;&gt; his nipples are pointing through the &gt;&gt; And my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] beautiful awesome nipples are pointing through it. Sir Bruno has come to the circle to air grievance. &gt;&gt; 10 things I hate about Aiden. Number one, uh, is he [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] his balls are always [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] drained. &gt;&gt; He's always drained. &gt;&gt; His [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he does [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] LS and his balls are always [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; And I'm like, give me a piece. Leave it in. Leave it, kiddo. &gt;&gt; No, you don't. Leave it. &gt;&gt; Let Let him Let him learn. &gt;&gt; Let him limit test. &gt;&gt; He's seen too much. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. His balls are always [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] drained. He show He goes to LS. He gives them their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the pumping of a lifetime. Imagine Imagine Doug Doug quivering. &gt;&gt; I feel like it's the left and right brain. I feel like he's using two sides of him. &gt;&gt; One Nick's right. &gt;&gt; Famously, we get Gayen. &gt;&gt; They get they &gt;&gt; they're not allowed to have beat the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of &gt;&gt; If you saw the guest we had today, Gayen wouldn't have flown on that show. &gt;&gt; Do you have Net Who on Finally? &gt;&gt; Finally. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. I'm just kidding. &gt;&gt; I can't even I can't even bask in [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; You can't even My balls are Hold on. My balls are only drained because my first my first [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] said she couldn't show up at 9:00 a.m. &gt;&gt; That's true. You &gt;&gt; And And I said, "I'll be there for you, baby, but I have to see second I have to see seconds at at 3." &gt;&gt; He tried to drain his balls. &gt;&gt; I tried to drain my balls of life kissing LS with the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on his tongue. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. &gt;&gt; It's so funny cuz Okay. Our guest our guest today our guest today. &gt;&gt; Was it Dan Benson? It was It was Steve Eisman. Who is If you've seen The Big Short, it's the character that it's the real guy that Steve Carell is playing in that movie. &gt;&gt; Oh, what? You had him there. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. The guy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And he was he was a guest on our show. And before we started recording, the other two are trying to explain the yard to him. He's just and I'm &gt;&gt; and and we were like struggling to like explain kind of the you know the the the perhaps broy podcast that we made. &gt;&gt; You're trying to explain comedy to a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] guy who works in a bank. &gt;&gt; No, but then it's like it's like back to back. I just was hanging out with that guy like two hours ago and now we're talking about how I'm kissing him with come on my lips or something. &gt;&gt; And you know what I was thinking about this. So, so, uh, dude, Otto, right before he left, he was like, "Dude, this the website owner of the the website domain company that we used to use that we haven't used for years." He's like, he just posted a selfie with Benjamin Netany and Yahoo. &gt;&gt; Shout out to Monday.com. &gt;&gt; I was like, and I was like, that's crazy. He's like, I know. He's like, you just don't have to post that. And then I was thinking, this goes back to that coffee shop argument we had a long time ago at that photo shoot where Aiden and Hitler would get along because Aiden is just so forgiving of everyone. Imagine Aiden and Benjamin Netanyahu splitting a cab, &gt;&gt; dude. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; You would be so nice to him and it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pathetic. That's number two thing I hate to you wouldn't be mean to him. This is the real test. This is the real test. This is This is This is low key. It might not happen. We might have a line on getting Obama on that show &gt;&gt; eventually. &gt;&gt; Barack Obama &gt;&gt; and and I was reflecting on this because we have a bit not even a bit a section of the show from a long time ago where we say like I I confidently say I'd ask Obama about the drone strikes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh. &gt;&gt; And no one is like and you are like you wouldn't do it. You would not ask Obama about the drone strikes. And I was looking at the other two. I was like if we ever have him on You need to understand. I have to ask. &gt;&gt; Is agents accessing a part of the world previously unaccessible? &gt;&gt; Obama. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; deadass. I think we could get Steve Ivan Eisman on this show. &gt;&gt; Steve Eisman. Was he fun? Was he hilarious? &gt;&gt; He kind of was fun. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; He he very very knowledgeable and fun &gt;&gt; and Republican. &gt;&gt; And I don't think he's Republican. &gt;&gt; He hates the gays. &gt;&gt; He might be. I don't think he hates the gays. I was joking. Slime shakes his head. I hear the chain mail. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I want I I was just shaking my head cuz I wanted to hear &gt;&gt; if it doesn't go through but the sound effects. &gt;&gt; Low key. I will say this. Chain mail guys in back in the day must have loved this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] It feels awesome. &gt;&gt; Imagine getting hit in the head by a sword and living and being like, "Oh my god, this stuff rules." &gt;&gt; Or maybe it's &gt;&gt; maybe it's like skateboarding. Like, oh, you're wearing chain mail while you fight. Gay. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. Yeah. If you wear if you have knee pads at the skatepark. Wait, wouldn't it be like But everybody at the skatepark has a helmet on in this scenario. &gt;&gt; Uh, &gt;&gt; but everybody's still gay. &gt;&gt; It's what is &gt;&gt; chain mail is pretty popular. &gt;&gt; I think here the the real thing is that if you have armor, you have money and armor is good because you can live. &gt;&gt; Well, maybe when chain mail came out, uh, they were wearing like one guy wore it and everyone was like, "Gay cringe." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Like, bro, what are you going to wear? &gt;&gt; Are you afraid of getting hit in the head with a chain? And then one guy got hit in the head like real crazy like it like it split up like Kill Bill and he was like and they were like we should wear the &gt;&gt; we saw Gort get his head an axe buried into his head and we didn't like that. &gt;&gt; So now we wear chain mail even though it's expensive. All right, number three thing I hate about Aiden. So his balls are drained. Number two, he'd be nice to Netany and Yahoo. &gt;&gt; I do want to get through all 10. &gt;&gt; Uh number three. &gt;&gt; I think that's it. &gt;&gt; Did you think? What did you want to say? the first started somewhere. Started somewhere. &gt;&gt; I thought I thought I'd get to 10 really fast, but I don't know. I'm in a more relaxed era of my life now. &gt;&gt; And I'm a likable guy. &gt;&gt; No, I don't think that's true. I think I do. Okay, you know what I was watching? Do you know that clip of the millennial saxophone dancer people? You know what I'm talking about, right? &gt;&gt; And that's a miserable looking clip. &gt;&gt; It's like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] music and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] people making [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] things, dude. But it's entrancing. You have to watch. You want to watch it. &gt;&gt; It is. And so, &gt;&gt; can we find this? I don't know. I probably have. &gt;&gt; I don't know what to search to pull it up. That's my problem. &gt;&gt; Can you Millennial &gt;&gt; saxophone dance Tik Tok &gt;&gt; SCA? &gt;&gt; Isn't it a SCA band &gt;&gt; clip? &gt;&gt; Oh, it's SCA. &gt;&gt; I think so. There's horns &gt;&gt; and then and then the one woman, she's at the front and they all they do the dance and then it's like D and it's it's it's really cringe. And I was thinking Aiden. So Aiden, let's say Aiden meets Netanyahu, right? &gt;&gt; I mean Netanyahu and I do my scar band &gt;&gt; and he's like, "Hey B." And he's because they call him his like baby name for some reason. It's always so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] weird. &gt;&gt; And so he's like, "Hey B, nice to see you, man." He's like, "I'm on my way to see Donald Trump." And like, you know, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a pig or whatever. And then and so he's in the car and he's like, "Hey, check this out." Oh, and he pulls up his phone and it's that Aiden because he's &gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a pig or it's &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. It's Sorry. It's the It's the squad dancing thing. He likes that. He likes that clip. He's like, "This is my favorite &gt;&gt; video." He Netanyahu on his phone scrolls past the video of him [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a pig. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that Well, yeah, obviously it's there's like there's like 10 different squares of him [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] different pigs, &gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] different pigs. &gt;&gt; And and but and he goes and he's like, "I like this. Check this out." Because Aiden is a nice guy, he's unable to say, "Oh, that's awesome." He He's unable to say that sucks. &gt;&gt; Well, Aiden, I ask you this question. &gt;&gt; He would say, "That's awesome." Even though he doesn't think that, but you would say that cuz you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fake. And it's disingenuous. I think it's disingenuous to be that. Instead, you should be like, "That sucks." &gt;&gt; So, you might remember, you might remember there was a little episode recently where we argued about the lights for 45 minutes. &gt;&gt; I don't know what you're talking about. &gt;&gt; Then this is why we wound up. &gt;&gt; Why did we argue about the lights? &gt;&gt; The beautiful pop artist. &gt;&gt; Stupid. I can't even think of it. probably made it up. I probably dreamed about it. Uh and we and we delineated some things that, you know, maybe maybe are problems each of us could deal with. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I think yours was getting mad at the manufactured versions of people in your head. &gt;&gt; What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; I was I'm remembering that. Here's the thing though is I'm right. It doesn't matter if it's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fake version cuz this has probably happened. Someone has brought in a phone and showed you something that you think sucks and you go, "That's cool." &gt;&gt; Let's play it out. Let's play it out. You're You're Big Ben. I'm Aiden. And you're the Uber driver. And action. &gt;&gt; Uh, hey. Um, what ethnicity are you really quick before we get continue driving this car? &gt;&gt; Serbian. &gt;&gt; And then he like checks a chart. That's fine. All right. &gt;&gt; Excuse me. Um, random question. I'm so sorry. Uh, are you Netanyahu? Ah, that's me. I'm Benjamin Netanyahu. &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. That's so crazy. Um, &gt;&gt; yeah. Uh, I do a podcast and we talk we talk we talk politics. &gt;&gt; What's that? &gt;&gt; Um, it's like &gt;&gt; is it like nek? &gt;&gt; It's like a m It's like a music but longer. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Can you &gt;&gt; Hey, hey, you Serbian pig. &gt;&gt; Sir, can you &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; can you please drive a little safer? &gt;&gt; Cuz he probably says some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that. &gt;&gt; Serbians. &gt;&gt; Hey, you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Hey, you Serbian rat dog. &gt;&gt; No. Hey, drive straight, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; No English. Just moved here. &gt;&gt; He just spoke English. Um, any almost two complete sentences. Uh, I'm c I was curious if maybe uh you'd want to come on my podcast. &gt;&gt; Hold on. Check this out. Look, I love this video. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Do you like that? &gt;&gt; This is a place we can agree on. &gt;&gt; That was a trick. I pull off this mask. Who are you? I'm a chain mail. It's not Nyago at all. And I say, "I got you, motherfucker." &gt;&gt; Wait, hold on. But then I pull off the mask on Netanyahu. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Wait, but who's driving the car? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. And then the Serbian pulls off his mask and it's the same pulls off his skin. &gt;&gt; And then like he's bleeding all over himself. &gt;&gt; And he's like, "Good." &gt;&gt; Uh, yeah. So, I genuinely believe that it's what I'm trying to say is I think it's disingenuous &gt;&gt; to pretend that something is cool just to be polite when you can play the medium of it to let someone know this is kind of stupid, but I'm not going to make you feel bad about it. &gt;&gt; I think this is Netanyahu aside. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Who I don't if you can put it aside. &gt;&gt; Okay. If I don't want to who I admittedly don't want to be chummy with I &gt;&gt; you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; I think I think I have a genuine maybe skill of I I find something I legitimately enjoy in most things that other people are excited about. &gt;&gt; Even that video. &gt;&gt; Even that video because that video is kind of like this is I had this I literally watched this video today. I literally watched this video and I had the thought of &gt;&gt; why why is this cringe to people? It's like am I not just watching five people have a good time? Like this is this is I'm glad that they're having a good time. This is fine. People it is better to be the person on stage doing that than be the person who's bitching about it on Twitter. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes. I think Okay. The the problem is if everyone's like you, the world sucks. And if everyone's like me, the world sucks. &gt;&gt; But I still think that it sucks to just have to accept it because it's the let people enjoy things. &gt;&gt; You know what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; I don't think it's a let people enjoy things type B. It's me finding my own small piece of enjoyment I in it instead of my pie chart of looking at this thing and being like this sucks and is cringe. I'm like I feel that way like 70% of the way but 30% of me is like this is kind of fun and you just let the 30% run wild when you're talking to other people. &gt;&gt; I'm just I'm still laughing about the guy he created [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; What are you talking about? It's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Aiden. &gt;&gt; Is that a guy &gt;&gt; version of Aiden with empty balls? &gt;&gt; Who's chummy with Netanyahu? &gt;&gt; Is that not Is that not lemonade stand in a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nutshell? &gt;&gt; Yeah. On God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know what it is? We had Netanyahu Netanyahu on and he drained my balls or something. Uh &gt;&gt; you don't have a guilt about your balls being empty for us. &gt;&gt; I don't I don't because I said I would be here at 9:00. I said I would still show up at 9:00. Do you promise that you give us the most balls that you can? &gt;&gt; I give you the best balls all the time. I do this show before Lemonade Stand every time I record full house. Almost every time John say I'm sitting on Aiden's lap like &gt;&gt; I'm doing love you forever even if mom's gone. &gt;&gt; Speaking of mom's gone, he's going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] explode in a fireball. Dude, &gt;&gt; I &gt;&gt; Everyone around the office thinks he's going to die. &gt;&gt; And he might. Death is always around the corner. &gt;&gt; That's really the You know what? Actually, I don't want to go to France at all anymore. I'm so over it. You know what made me rethink I want to go is I got to I have to be there if he dies. &gt;&gt; If he dies, we have to be there. &gt;&gt; We have to be there. &gt;&gt; Or Aiden will feel miserable. &gt;&gt; And we got to do an episode of the yard with his smoking. Still smoking. &gt;&gt; Yeah. With like a piece of his foot. &gt;&gt; It's weird to have the thought. &gt;&gt; It's like two crocs like some bone sticking out. &gt;&gt; Was that just through tears? We're like, "What do you think of that one?" &gt;&gt; Smell. &gt;&gt; God, I would be so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sad if he died. Oh my god, it'd be so annoying. It'd &gt;&gt; be horrible. &gt;&gt; But he cuz he was he was doing that simulator. Did you see the clip of him doing the sim and just getting in a wreck and just flying around? It was really crazy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I don't know. &gt;&gt; We got But we got to go. And Aiden's bailing cuz he has empty walls. &gt;&gt; Ludwig has crashed every vehicle he's owned. &gt;&gt; This is what I'm worried about, &gt;&gt; dude. &gt;&gt; Is that he has a bad track record with crashing vehicles. &gt;&gt; Wait, is it actually I'm I'm like running the numbers. It's the sandbar. &gt;&gt; It's almost every single &gt;&gt; He hasn't been able to drive that. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I guess he's got no miles. &gt;&gt; Jeda Jetta has been in a crash. Both bikes have been in a crash. &gt;&gt; Sambar's been stolen. So that's kind of like crashing it. Was like a mental crash. The crash out. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's an absence of caring. He left the keys in it. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that was unbelievable. &gt;&gt; Think I feel dishonest when I tell people it got stolen because the clip &gt;&gt; because look at him fly around. &gt;&gt; Wait, did he just Oh, he Okay, he acted it, &gt;&gt; dude. Oh my god. &gt;&gt; Isn't that terrifying? &gt;&gt; No. I love the no signal. Oh my. Is he off the map? &gt;&gt; He's falling infinitely. &gt;&gt; Isn't that crazy? That's what death is like. &gt;&gt; That's a really &gt;&gt; What happens when we die? &gt;&gt; That's crazy. &gt;&gt; How did he crash that mad? &gt;&gt; Lost control. Gosh, man. Make you lose control. &gt;&gt; You slime said 10 things you hate about me. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I got to &gt;&gt; 10 things you hate about you. &gt;&gt; I got deduced. That means I like you. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; You brought that up because we were talking about &gt;&gt; cuz your balls are empty. &gt;&gt; Being late. &gt;&gt; No, no, it's just your balls. &gt;&gt; Charlie day. Charlie Day. My balls are just empty. &gt;&gt; That didn't have anything to do with it. It was about splitting your time between us and LS and it's like you have this like dad has a new girlfriend but does he like mom still? &gt;&gt; Well, you guys split your time between League and me. &gt;&gt; So the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Yeah, we actually gave it pretty much all to League. &gt;&gt; All of it goes to league, bro. That's why it's seven and not six, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You had to fit one in. And I thought about it. Here's the thing. I was playing all day. I thought about playing another and I was like, if I lose, I'm going to be kind of in a pissy mood and I don't want to bring that into the pod. I just So I I decided to eat instead. And I want I want to say I'm proud of you, but you're 35. &gt;&gt; You're 35. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you. You're bald. Listen, by the way, &gt;&gt; I've conceded the race to gold. Now, I know Nick doesn't feel too great about that because, you know, it's a concession. &gt;&gt; Can you re-engage? You got to back to silver, too. &gt;&gt; It's It's not It's not the point. It's that I didn't have the mental. I didn't have the faculties. And I hated top lane and I quit. I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crashed out and I lost my mind. spot's already been taken. I don't know if you've heard that. &gt;&gt; And I quit. And there's a new race. &gt;&gt; A new race? It's me versus cutie. &gt;&gt; What? Like officially? &gt;&gt; Officially she she asked. &gt;&gt; She is a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bot. It's crazy. I don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] It's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. She's just so bad at the game. And I'm bad, too. But it's like, so you get the the way the matchmaking works right now for this ELO, you will get someone who has been for 10 years playing the game and is like pretty competent. And then you get people that have just finished their AI bot games and have are able to play ranked. And Cutie is like on the more side of the people that finish the AI bot games. That's the weird part. &gt;&gt; Dude, I don't know what to tell you. She's bad at the game. &gt;&gt; She hasn't played. I'm bad at the game, too. &gt;&gt; She hasn't played in a long time, right? &gt;&gt; Actively. &gt;&gt; I don't know. Actively, I don't. Who knows? &gt;&gt; But what rank is she right now? &gt;&gt; Fully open. She's silver, too. She placed into it. Oh, &gt;&gt; dude. Wait, so it's close. &gt;&gt; It's very close. And she's getting 35 LP a win and antenna loss. &gt;&gt; She has dude, she had a she had a session where she went I think four and seven &gt;&gt; and she ended up &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; she ended up LP. &gt;&gt; She has some kind of like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up like MMR that allow her to like just &gt;&gt; I was at 552. So I was me me and Kitty were supposed to do part of our race to gold at fast 52. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sucker lewig canceled it last minute. I drove I drove all the way to generational hoing and and even I got to fast I said in the middle of the day I said hey there's rumors that cutie's not even doesn't want to show up and does that mean we're not doing it? He goes no that's stupid. It's definitely happening. &gt;&gt; I was like oh okay are you sure? Cuz Dan's telling me she's not coming. He's like that no he's wrong. And I'm like oh okay I'm staying then. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Fast forward two hours. He's like, "Bro, like, I'm sorry, but like," and I'm like, "All right, it's fine, dude." &gt;&gt; This is one of my least favorite things with with Lwig with Lewig making decisions cuz sometimes because he's boss man at the end of the day, right? He gets to make like final call on the way that these productions work. If he wants to change something, if he wants to shave something, he can do it. He's a creative mastermind. But with something with something like this, this happens a lot where you you get an updated piece of information about something that's going on and then you bring it to Lwig as like it'll affect the final decision that he has to make for for his stream. But he he actually never got that piece of information like you think he did. Like he doesn't have the he just thinks it's the old way because it's still that way. And then you're bringing new information and he insists that it's wrong. &gt;&gt; He does this, but it's in I don't know how possibly Dan could have found that info instead of Lewig first. &gt;&gt; And I'm saying this happens all the time. This happens all the time. &gt;&gt; Cutie tell Dan. &gt;&gt; I don't know. &gt;&gt; And not Lwig. &gt;&gt; I don't I &gt;&gt; cuz Lwig's busy. And I bet she told Dan cuz he's the guy who's on the phone. &gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] why. &gt;&gt; Judy, when it comes to event planning, she she knows what the chain of command is. She knows how to disseminate the information. Well, I had a bunch of people. Uh, so I decided to I decided cuz there's people who were bummed out that the stream wasn't happening anymore. And they're like, "Oh, I came actually I stayed late to watch that stream." And I was like, "Pull up pull up a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] chair." And I played for a small crowd of like six at some point like 10 people and at some points like five or six people. &gt;&gt; You got to be like one of 10 people in the world that's ever happened to. &gt;&gt; And there and maybe like Faker at like a land cafe visiting. Uh, but uh, it was exactly like chat. Oh no. &gt;&gt; It was not a bad not in a bad way. It was fine. It was fine. They were cool. But there was just a guy would be like, "Hey, can I give you tips?" And I was like, "No." And he's like, "Okay, dude." &gt;&gt; They keep playing. And one one other guy would just be like, you know, and we played we played the scramle. &gt;&gt; Like it was &gt;&gt; You did the scramble. The scramle. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you did. &gt;&gt; It was just like Twitch. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Uh yeah. I mean, Miles and Josh were going to go as well to commentate and they had to &gt;&gt; They both showed up. &gt;&gt; They both showed up. Josh doesn't drive a car, so I don't know how he got there. &gt;&gt; I don't even know how the hell he got there, but no, Miles came later. Miles drove and then just to pick up Josh. He had to leave immediately. &gt;&gt; Uh we Man, this guy everywhere. The [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up part is &gt;&gt; if he blows up in a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fireball, it all gets erased. &gt;&gt; The last thing we've ever said, the last thing we've ever said about him, if that happens, is we [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hate him and he owed us. So, we got to be nice at the very end of the episode. We can be as many as we want for the next hour, but at the end, we got to say one. It's like it's like at the very end of your life when you're just like and I believe in Jesus and accept into my heart. &gt;&gt; Pascal's Lwig wager. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Wager. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; Why do I like him so much, man? &gt;&gt; He's such a piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dude. &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know. I just been I was wearing the chain mail. I got you a Wood Ranch hat, but I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] left it in my house. I was going to give it to you as a commemoration for your solo Q journey because you went to Wood Ranch alone as well and the way you play League and the solo queue. You made it, but I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] left it in the house. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And everything. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] L cow. &gt;&gt; You're a Low, man. &gt;&gt; I'm a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] L cow, bro. &gt;&gt; You're a cow, man. &gt;&gt; I am, dude. &gt;&gt; You're a cow. Low. &gt;&gt; He wishes he was a LOL cow. You wish people [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Can I put you guys on some game I discovered while I was in Canada? &gt;&gt; Let's hear the game. &gt;&gt; Okay, we're taking uh my mom's dropping us. We I went to a wedding in Washington state, but it's on the border. So, we have to fly into Vancouver, which means you cross the border on the way. Right. My mom doesn't have enough charge in the car to get us all the way to the airport when we wake up Sunday morning. &gt;&gt; Liberal car. &gt;&gt; So, she drops us off. &gt;&gt; Exactly what was in my head. Exactly what I was going to say. She drops us off at McDonald's and we have to Uber get in the car uh Indian driver and he's listening and he's listening. This is important. This is important. He's listening to Indian music. I I don't know enough about Indian languages to know if it's like like Hindi or Punjabi at first and but one song comes on and I'm like damn this kind of oh this kind of rips like and it it's it's like this insane rap beat with like guns and reload sounds in the background and this guy just rapping over it which I found out is Punjabi &gt;&gt; and and and then it cuts into a drill like freestyle like 2K drill in the middle of the song. I'm like, dude, what is this? And I'm like, I wonder is this? And then I had I and I'm ashamed to even think it &gt;&gt; that is this a little bit of stolen valor here. Like he's talking all this like me. He's got, you know, a ton of gun sounds in this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] song. Like this is crazy. &gt;&gt; Stealing the valor from who? &gt;&gt; Look at the song is called Can you look at the music video? It's called Celebrity Killer. No, I saw it on his phone. Celebrity Killer. That's a tough song. by Sidu. S I D Hu. &gt;&gt; Celebrity killer is really cool. And we could just we should just listen to like 30 seconds of it. Just go to like the middle. &gt;&gt; It's a great name if you play like top lane or something. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's about to cut into it. You just let it go. &gt;&gt; Dude, this is this is this guy's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] massive. What's the What's the feature? &gt;&gt; Tion Wade. &gt;&gt; So, this guy Sidum Moose Walla. Uh, this song's This song's huge. &gt;&gt; 146 million. &gt;&gt; He's a ton. Like, he's massive on Spotify, right? Like is all these streams on these songs. I'm like, this song this song's crazy. But I'm like, you know, leaving pretty leaning pretty heavy into the gun culture and stuff like that is like, you know, a lot of rappers do that. Not a big deal. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; I looked this guy up, dude. He was assassinated three years ago by an opposing Indian gang. &gt;&gt; This guy, &gt;&gt; this guy, dude, he's dead. He died at 28 and he died in a like to another Indian gang. And I was like, "Holy shit." Here I I felt like such an idiot. I'm in the car questioning this man. And he [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lived that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dude. &gt;&gt; Dude, he's the fio of whatever city. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what I thought. I'm like, this is some like who I smoke Punjabi edition. I didn't know about any of this. &gt;&gt; That's crazy. There's such a big beautiful world out there for all of us. &gt;&gt; I will say drill as a genre in particular, very plugandplay. There's basically drill in every country. &gt;&gt; There's like there's even Australian drill, &gt;&gt; which and there's and there's and there's UK drill. There's I think Chicago drill was likely the first. Uh it's just one of the it's just a tempo of beat a style of rapping kind of happens everywhere often involved with a lot of gun violence. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Even in India apparently &gt;&gt; I sent you as if you pull up the image I sent you. All this talk reminded me of some picture I saw today that I thought was really good. And uh &gt;&gt; Wow, dude. It's like, dude, if you told me it's not actually Mr. Beast, it's beans, I'd believe you. It looks like beans. That's crazy, bro. &gt;&gt; Yeah. People just keep putting Mr. Beast's face on like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like just other people's pictures, &gt;&gt; dude. This is almost exactly what DJ Z made looks like. &gt;&gt; I know. Yeah. Oh, okay. By the way, guys, uh I wanted to give everyone an update on the art in the yard um situation. &gt;&gt; It's gotten it's a very interesting place. &gt;&gt; It got pretty weird. So, &gt;&gt; if you're not caught up on the saga, if this is the first episode of the yard you've ever seen potentially, there is a small event in New Hampshire, an artist event. Sorry. Sorry. North Carolina, not not New Hampshire. In North Carolina, some sort of artist collaborative event, and they have stolen our logo, and they've been using it for many years. Um, which is normally fine. Normally we wouldn't care. But then we there we realized they started there. Yeah, here's that logo. We realized they started selling merch on top of with our logo on it. We're like, it's a art event. Probably shouldn't steal art to put on the merch. &gt;&gt; To me, it was also the idea is an art event. &gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly. &gt;&gt; You're kind of in, you know, &gt;&gt; it's like that's specific. You should get someone in the community to make the maybe do a contest in the community, something like that. &gt;&gt; You want that? Uh and and and then we and then we reached out and we reached out and we said, "Hey, we think that you may be using our logo." &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so &gt;&gt; and we got a reply. &gt;&gt; So we got a reply and uh so this the it's on the Instagram account and whoever is running it said we actually worked with a graphic artist and paid him to develop the graphic for us. If you could message me. So there's actually double space after the period which implies this person is a lot older. uh which is a crucial if you could message me where I can see that your logo can be viewed and with date info I'd be happy to take a look. I instantly reply with the first episode of the yard shingle bells. Uh there's a picture of me laughing at Aiden's gross belly. It's very funny. And I say sure here's the first episode of our podcast called the yard. Uh I said whoever designed your logo probably googled the yard logo and ours popped up and they added elements. We also have design docs from when we developed it with the designer that we hired. Uh, I know it's just a picket fence, but it's one to one our logo and it's a it's a brand that matters to me. And I said, also genuinely, if you print out and feature my art at your event and send me a picture of it displayed, you can keep the logo. I said this and then I sent them, &gt;&gt; we'll show all the art on the screen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, we showed it last week, but it's it's a great piece. And I said, this is my art. And uh they reply, "So I see the similarity of one part which is the fence. &gt;&gt; The it's the logo &gt;&gt; which is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy. &gt;&gt; Which is the which is the middle the the only logo element really? &gt;&gt; Yeah. The the rest is just colors and &gt;&gt; and text. &gt;&gt; But our logo was created prior to July 2021, which we have documentation of our purchase and the design from the professional graphic designer we hired. And he said and they said, "We are not mass-producing any product with the logo. The t-shirts were only for our local artists." &gt;&gt; Why would you say that next if you're also arguing &gt;&gt; if you own it &gt;&gt; that that you made it first? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I I think to be fair, it's like maybe they are just doing for staff shirts or whatever. &gt;&gt; So it's like they're trying to say like we're not selling a bunch of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Um but it is like if they thought they owned it, they shouldn't they shouldn't care. Um, &gt;&gt; maybe you're just hedging for the timeline that you you might not be certain about the timeline, too. I don't know. &gt;&gt; Um, and then they said, "And no, I'm not going to publish your art anywhere in association with our event, but thank you for sharing it with me." &gt;&gt; I loved that. I loved that because in my head, the my first read of that was that was completely genuine, too. &gt;&gt; You should ask, are you sure? &gt;&gt; Are you sure? Hey, I just draw another dick coming. I'm like, how about this one? I've made two and then you reverse the image. &gt;&gt; Uh and then so so I said, "Can you show me proof of that?" And they said, "Yes, but not today." This was a Thursday last week. The person who worked with the graphic artist is traveling and when she returns, she will provide it to me and I can send it to you. I said, "Okay, thank you." You understand my confusion at you saying it's from before our show, right? What this would mean is that we used the same graphic designer who submitted both designs to each of us independently. So they which also the designer we used had several versions of this. &gt;&gt; The the design it was a process. &gt;&gt; Not there's &gt;&gt; so I I developed the logo with our designer and it was like done before that date like significantly before that date cuz that was just the first episode. &gt;&gt; I mean we even showed it in the trailer. &gt;&gt; There was like multiple different versions of it and and there was like a Actually, the designer that we used had a logo type that we didn't use. A second designer created the type that we use. They they actually didn't create it. It's just a It's literally just like an Adobe font or something. &gt;&gt; Um it's like a It's like a free to use Adobe font. &gt;&gt; Um &gt;&gt; but uh yeah. No, there's just no It would be an awesome plot twist &gt;&gt; if our designer stole it, right? because there's a possibility that &gt;&gt; uh because if they if they can find proof that in early 2021 or before the they used this logo somewhere, right? Or even I guess just had it or No, no, they have to have used it somewhere that our designer could have stolen it. &gt;&gt; Yes. Which would have which would be awesome. That's a very fun plot twist. It would just be so the the likelihood of them finding the same designer is so low because I hired like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] firm from like a Eastern European country that I searched for like days for. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The guy was named Eigor. &gt;&gt; No, I wasn't. Uh but so so they messaged me again and &gt;&gt; Sergey &gt;&gt; it was it was like a a day later and they said we've been using this logo since the beginning of our project almost 5 years ago. And I'm like, well, the art is almost five years ago if you want to. I have to confirm with the graphic designer when he where he actually completed the piece and where he got the image from. So now they're starting to wonder. &gt;&gt; It's so ultimately like people have stolen our logo a lot of times. People have Googled yard logo, not not knowing that we exist because they're doing something yard related. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's just in two nouns and it's like, "Oh, this is a nice looking fence cuz it's it's well-designed logo." &gt;&gt; The only reason I care now is because they're denying it. Yes. Now we Now we get to be right. &gt;&gt; I was on stream. I I deep dive their they they have like I'm not kidding. They have like a 100 thousand Facebook posts. Like it's it took me so long to get to the bottom because there's no like jump to the bottom or sort by oldest. You to just scroll &gt;&gt; to me so much longer than you would think. I finally got to the bottom and they have posts like in 2021 and in 2020, but the the logo doesn't show up in any of their posts until September 2022. &gt;&gt; Okay. one year after &gt;&gt; our show hit the market hit the market. &gt;&gt; So there there was a the final piece of this saga so far is someone sent me a message on Twitter and they said I live on the island that does the monthly art in the yard thing. Uh and I don't know how much the pot has influences but in the past 3 days they've been slowly taking down all the banners and signs with the logo on it. I used to pass like a dozen on my drive to Bojangles and now they're all gone. &gt;&gt; And I think this person is in nowhere because it is on an island. Apparently it's like some island in the North Carolina coast &gt;&gt; where it's like probably affluent suburban. &gt;&gt; Send them send them the the episode with Mr. Beast &gt;&gt; and say we're owned by Mr. Beast company. It's that picture. Oh, but it's still bark. &gt;&gt; And if you do not remove our logo, we're going to get we're going to get Jimmy involved. &gt;&gt; We're going to get Jimmy. &gt;&gt; We're going to get Jimmy's legal involved. &gt;&gt; Put you in a burning house. &gt;&gt; Now, when they just saying directly to the person, you can put the signs back on up. Just display my art. &gt;&gt; Just That's what I'm saying. Like the art. &gt;&gt; I gave them an out. &gt;&gt; I gave them &gt;&gt; You know what? We'll design merch for your event. We'll do all your events merch and we'll help you sell it kind of if you display our art. &gt;&gt; Display the art. &gt;&gt; This is a guaranteed stream of income. &gt;&gt; Is it not a little homophobic to &gt;&gt; Oh, what's so we're not going to be spend a day taking down signs rather than just displaying a beautiful penis at an art show? &gt;&gt; Uh, I'm not going to display your art, but thanks for sharing. &gt;&gt; What if I come to the event? And what if I do it at the event? Will you display it then? I came to the event. If I show my art at the event in a different version of it, in a different medium, will will you then let me show it to you? &gt;&gt; If I if the choice was mine, instead of spending a whole day working hard, walking around town, taking signs down, I would just put the penis up. &gt;&gt; Just put the art up. &gt;&gt; Just put the penis up. &gt;&gt; Put the penis artis Oh my god, it' be so funny if we fly there and we like we dress like Gmen. like suits, glasses, earpieces, and we just show up and we just pretend. We don't say that we're FBI or any We don't impersonate anyone. We just act like we are. &gt;&gt; And we're checking out the logo on like a wall and we're like, "This is great. Do you know who behind this?" Like this. Do you know who was &gt;&gt; wait? We're we're we're Gmen. We're federal agents that are just interested in the world. We're trying and we're trying to get to the bottom of who designed it and they clearly know who sent us. &gt;&gt; They start answering the question, no. Could you say it into the mic? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Or or we just say every time they say something, we just write it out like therapists. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; No, I just I just forget a lot of stuff. Is that clip of 6ix9ine saying he smashed his phone when the feds raided him and he had all his phone numbers written down on paper and they were like, "Why do you have a bunch of phone numbers written down?" And he's like, "I don't like phones. Duh. He was like, "I had Nicki Minaj's number written down on a piece of paper." &gt;&gt; Sir, I'm dying out here, man. &gt;&gt; You've been eating dog meat every day, and I know you're busy fighting this this war on my behalf. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I had an axe buried into my skull yesterday. &gt;&gt; But I think you could have a more complete meal. &gt;&gt; I would love that because this sucks. &gt;&gt; Are you eating dog because you have such a busy morning getting, you know, sharpening your axe and and your and finding your way? &gt;&gt; Extremely busy.

Thanks, Juel. &gt;&gt; I was watching Seinfeld and I watched Jerry find someone's number in a book of phone numbers and I was like, "The world's different." &gt;&gt; Whoa. &gt;&gt; The world's different now. My mom had one, too. &gt;&gt; My granny still does that. That's old people [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Yeah. She walks up to the phone cuz she uses the home phone mainly. She walks up opens a drawer, takes out a notepad that she stores all of her contacts and and then types in the phone number from the notepad. &gt;&gt; Makes the &gt;&gt; What a shitty [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] your grandma is. &gt;&gt; Indian drill rapper. She's probably talking to one three hours a day on that thing. &gt;&gt; She's like, I just gave I just gave a nice young man half of my savings. to turn it into three times. &gt;&gt; You told me not to redeem and I didn't. &gt;&gt; Granny, stop giving your RBC account number. &gt;&gt; I had to do a wire transfer. It was It was very easy. I just went to the bank and &gt;&gt; prepaid cards. There were 7-Eleven. There were &gt;&gt; Oh my god, dude. I If my mom didn't die, I think there's I I think a lot about her trajectory of like cuz she died before Trump happened. &gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] She died most before Obama happened &gt;&gt; and she didn't really give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] She was like, "Life sucks no matter what. Who doesn't matter who president is?" I was like, "You're right, my my good bitch." And so but I was like I was thinking like I wonder if Trump would have made sense to her, dumbass. Or maybe my dad he I remember he was in the like 2020 he's like I like Bernie. Bernie's a crazy guy. &gt;&gt; I like the crazy guy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I'm like some people are just But he can't he couldn't vote cuz he's convicted felon. So &gt;&gt; what are you going to do? What are you going to do, man? &gt;&gt; Can't do damn [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about nothing. &gt;&gt; I think I would have been happy walking away from all this. I think I still would be happy they could keep the logo if we could sell their whole thing as like a tie-dye t-shirt. &gt;&gt; No, let's just do it. &gt;&gt; We could just do it. &gt;&gt; Why don't we just What are they going to do? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We said this last episode and we said the link is below and we never did it. &gt;&gt; We didn't do it. &gt;&gt; We're going to do it. &gt;&gt; But I do want to bring it this and we're going to put it in hindsight in that episode. &gt;&gt; Let's do it. Why not? &gt;&gt; He's all ged up right now. This is guy who smokes weed like we should make a movie. And then and then in an hour it's like I'm tired. &gt;&gt; You guys over like I'm serious. Let's do it. &gt;&gt; Dude, no. I know you want to, but I don't know if I will later. &gt;&gt; I'm going to be so tired, bro. &gt;&gt; You know what? Let's draft up their their logo on a shirt and then send it in the conversation and say, "Would you guys be okay with us selling this shirt?" &gt;&gt; And see what they say. &gt;&gt; What we could do? What? I here we felt bad and we we wanted to give you a couple passes on a new logo and we sent them back this same thing but it's just undefeated in the middle. &gt;&gt; You guys can use this. This was one of our backup options. &gt;&gt; She just types TS tough and then wilted a wilted rose emoji. &gt;&gt; So yeah, we'll see what happens with that saga. I hope to hear back. I'll be like, "Sorry, I'm in France traveling right now. Sorry, we're taking our business to France right now. &gt;&gt; I was in premium economy to France. So, uh, &gt;&gt; yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah, my husband booked me in premium. &gt;&gt; We're flying second class. &gt;&gt; We're flying second. Oh, this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on my wrist. I'm not even worried about &gt;&gt; my rich. This is a psycho. &gt;&gt; That's the Northern Life $400. I got your weekly rent on my wrist. &gt;&gt; Yeah, dude. I was today I I opened I just opened YouTube and one of the recommended streams it was feeding me is just this like live feed of the Manhattan SK city skyline from like Queens or something. It just runs 24 hours a day &gt;&gt; to like catch another event, &gt;&gt; dude. And I was like this guy has got to be like begging for 911 to happen again. Just sitting there just frothing for the day. &gt;&gt; It's like a a plane is like flying above the skyline. He's like like why else why else do you have that? You're just hoping for a helicopter crash or some terrible event. I feel like &gt;&gt; it's like there were I don't know if people still do this. They probably do, but there was this like Bakersfield um police scanner guy who would just listen to the police scanner and then drive to where cops were and just hang out and and just live stream it. And he was really the cops hated him &gt;&gt; cuz they're like we're just we responded to this. what are you doing here? And he's like, I'm just looking. And it's like it's funny for both like they're both like weirdos, &gt;&gt; but this is like just just slightly more tolerable nightcrawler. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. For 10 viewers &gt;&gt; chasing him around and yelling like at the criminal. You don't have to tell him that. Know your rights. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. Coaching. &gt;&gt; No. He's holding a cell phone at him. &gt;&gt; Oh god. That's Yeah, that's just literally getting over the shoulder coached in a league game is getting arrested and someone's like, "You don't have to say anything. You can be quiet right now. &gt;&gt; Those guys are so cool. &gt;&gt; The the sovereign citizens. &gt;&gt; Yeah, they're really cool. &gt;&gt; It's weird because &gt;&gt; they have so much confidence. &gt;&gt; You got to be so bored and so wealthy. &gt;&gt; No, they're Dude, a lot of them are all day. &gt;&gt; No, I don't think they're I don't think they're wealthy. &gt;&gt; How How do they They don't have a job all day. What do they do? &gt;&gt; You can't I You can't be on that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and have a lot to lose. &gt;&gt; Yeah, bro. Like people who are wealthy do not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with the cops for fun. I feel like they've got they've got some they're sitting on some sort of weird trust fund and they're and they hate the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cops in there. &gt;&gt; No, it's people in like libertarian coded counties that just want to limit tests to the the police. But it's funny cuz the sovereign citizens are so annoying that when the cops beat them up, in a way you kind of are like, yeah, you you were egging that guy on, but then the cop's also a cop. So it's like you want him to blow his head off with a shotgun. So it's like it's weird. It's like everyone you know is fighting and that you hate. &gt;&gt; Two least the two least favorite guys in the world after each other &gt;&gt; and they're just going at it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But uh you know you know Scott, our friend Scott? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I know Scott. &gt;&gt; You guys don't know Scott. Scott? &gt;&gt; We don't know Scott. &gt;&gt; I always do this joke cuz I forget that you guys met him, but he's a public defender and he says &gt;&gt; we've met Scott so many times. &gt;&gt; He's those he says those people that pull the um like the the granular line by line sovereign citizen law [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] They usually get off. It's only when they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up their own and they they convict themselves by accident or they like what do you call it? They uh incriminate themselves. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; But a lot of times they get off. &gt;&gt; So &gt;&gt; dude, I love that there's so many videos of those guys are driving and the cops like you know why I pulled you over and he's like I don't talk. &gt;&gt; They're like I'm just &gt;&gt; the window's like this. &gt;&gt; The window is like literally like a piece of paper. It's like the exact thickness of your license. And he's like can you roll the window down? And you're like huh? Sorry. No, I can. So funny. &gt;&gt; A mixture of like can't hear you and also I can hear you just fine to the crack. &gt;&gt; Uh position is what? No, no, no, no. I I I'm not discussing my day. &gt;&gt; Then the cop like the cop goes like a step. They're like I'm going to break the window. And he's like, "Go ahead, do it. Go ahead. Do it." And they break the window. &gt;&gt; They're bro. What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Bro, bro, bro. &gt;&gt; Which is it's like both of them. It's like, yeah, why are you breaking the window? But also, &gt;&gt; I think the next level of that is pedophile hunter. Like the guy who's who's who's like they've got the whole car rigged ready for a cop to pull them over. Like they're not they didn't just start the phone. It's like they're ready to be filmed inside their car. &gt;&gt; There's three angles. &gt;&gt; It's Yeah, there's three. &gt;&gt; It's like a fake taxi. &gt;&gt; Uh that the next step is the guy who peding and going to Target. &gt;&gt; Yeah, pretty much. &gt;&gt; What is that, &gt;&gt; dude? There was that body cam of the guy, the cop who there was like a woman that he arrested and she's like, "I'll [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you right now." In the backseat. She's like, "I'll [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you right now. I don't care." And he's like, "You can't be talking like that." He's like, "I'll [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] suck your dick right now." And then he just turns off his body camera. &gt;&gt; That's crazy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then and then he had sex with someone he arrested, which is insane. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Yeah. I think he got fired. &gt;&gt; He did anything in this. &gt;&gt; He probably got put on paid leave. So it's all &gt;&gt; If I was about to retire, yeah, you got to go out like that somehow. &gt;&gt; Having sex with somebody you're arrested and going on paid leave. &gt;&gt; You got to go on paid leave for that. You have to go on paid leave. You cannot just go on unpaid. You can't leave these people on paid. &gt;&gt; They go on paid leave. &gt;&gt; What are you going to do? &gt;&gt; If you don't pay them on the leave, they just they get out there and they start killing more dogs. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They get all riled up. You got to keep them paid so that &gt;&gt; it's the it's the it's the allen street reaper, but he's only just killing people's dogs. &gt;&gt; He's got three little dog treats etched into his shirt. He's got three little confirmed kills. Dude, this guy Bo I knew growing up, he kind of went crazy and he started feeding people's dogs poison meat. &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy. &gt;&gt; That helps no one. &gt;&gt; He had the hottest girlfriend. Oh my god. &gt;&gt; Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on. &gt;&gt; What is poison meat? &gt;&gt; Like Minecraft like po like zombie meat. &gt;&gt; He would like like poison hamburger meat with some poison that he knew would kill a dog. &gt;&gt; And he would throw it over the fence. &gt;&gt; We make poison meat for dogs. It's called chocolate away from this being a a perfect slime story. Like if you is like you had the hottest girlfriend &gt;&gt; and dude and and his little brother Derek was my best friend. He was the funniest guy I knew. Like that's we're we're one beat away. &gt;&gt; No, I think I said this before, but the rumor at school in elementary school was that his dad drove a semi. &gt;&gt; And so so rumors a rumor &gt;&gt; cuz we didn't know and no one was no one was like he was kind of a scary guy to talk to. &gt;&gt; I heard his dad has like a really normal job. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, no, cuz like sometimes there'd be a semi at school and it's a huge truck. It's scary. And be like, "That's Bose's dad. &gt;&gt; I bet that's Bose's dad." &gt;&gt; And that's not any more compelling. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then he chilled out. He got He got way more normal &gt;&gt; after poisoning the dogs. &gt;&gt; After poisoning the dogs, &gt;&gt; how old was he when he was poisoning the dogs? Well, he got it out of his system. &gt;&gt; 15 16 dogs. &gt;&gt; You got You got to crack a few eggs. &gt;&gt; Yeah, crack a few eggs. Also, they I just heard this was going on, but it's a weird thing to make up in this small town. &gt;&gt; So, it's like this guy Colin, I remember Colin, the first time I heard the word socialist, it's cuz he was ripping a bong and he ripped this like blue genie bong. He go clears it and he's like, "Kim voteful for Obama, bro. He's a socialist." And I was like, "What's that?" &gt;&gt; The amount of times that's been said after a bong, &gt;&gt; it was crazy. Uh, but I don't think he voted for no damn uh Romney. I'll say that much. Wait, who? It was John McCain. But yeah, so Bo turned out fine. Girlfriend was so goddamn beautiful and it was great. &gt;&gt; How'd he pull that? &gt;&gt; He was just RZ. &gt;&gt; That that that I I kill dog RZ. &gt;&gt; I think I think in a small town you take what you can get. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; And it's all good, man. Like he was &gt;&gt; if his if his job has anything to do with like steel or wood or any sort of m any sort of material, it's just Yes. What's happen six children? &gt;&gt; Young hand. Women love your hands. &gt;&gt; Women have strong hands. &gt;&gt; They love funny guys. &gt;&gt; Um and and they love they love [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] getting mad at their best friend, dude. &gt;&gt; Oh, and not telling them that they're mad at their best friend. &gt;&gt; You know who else they love? &gt;&gt; Clark Kent. That dumbass [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Mhm. &gt;&gt; That dumbass [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] who's not on the podcast right now. He's he's off being Superman. &gt;&gt; Someone said in the in the premium that there was a Lwig 1v3. Clean 1v3. And I was like, "What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you guys talking about?" &gt;&gt; They all They all People who watch this show, they hate when a group of right people talk to a wrong person. It's their least favorite thing. &gt;&gt; I don't like that. It's literally their least favorite [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] thing. &gt;&gt; I don't like that assessment because sometimes it reminds them of &gt;&gt; Sometimes the one guy is right. Sometimes the white guy, &gt;&gt; it reminds them of their They're they're both their parents being like, "We need you to get a real job." &gt;&gt; They're like, "What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is this? I'm being ganged up on." &gt;&gt; I'm being ganged up on right now, &gt;&gt; dude. I can't even bask cuz Lwick [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stupid bastard shithead's not here. I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] smoked him so bad. &gt;&gt; Smoked. I &gt;&gt; I drove down to Fast 52, did my job, and left. &gt;&gt; Can I be honest with you? &gt;&gt; I almost pissed laughing at that clip. I I watched I watched the clip the first when you rip it the first time again and I I genuinely at the end of the video I thought he's born to do this. &gt;&gt; I I showed the clip on the first part &gt;&gt; I showed the clip on stream and someone someone in chat said slime runs like an action figure come to life. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Someone said someone said I run like have a full diaper. Dude, I don't I run so crazy. But the same thing happened with the Olympic video. I just I think after France, I'm just gonna get a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] guy to fix me. I'm just gonna get a coach and say, "Fix me. Help me run normal cuz I run every week. You guys might be surprised." &gt;&gt; Is that the only thing he's fixing? &gt;&gt; What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; No, just is it is he to be focused on running? &gt;&gt; Go ahead, piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] What would you fix about me? No, I'm just &gt;&gt; Go ahead. Go ahead. I You know what I'd fix? I'd make your balls full all the time for me. &gt;&gt; Probably the running. Dude, you're such an eater. That blew my mind cuz like like when we go out and we eat food, Slime finishes his food at first. Everyone, it's a classic Slime thing. He eats his food first. He might even leave before you're done eating. Like sometimes he goes, "All right, I'm going home." And I'm like, "I thought we were I thought we were hanging out." So, but I didn't think that that necessarily translated to competition. The fact that no one in that group, those were the people who volunteered. &gt;&gt; They thought I could eat pretty fast. &gt;&gt; I probably eat pretty fast. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; That You're an eater. What What is that? When did you learn this? Have you always had it? I've always eaten really fast is a great question. Thanks for asking. Uh I've always &gt;&gt; uh I guess it's like four microphones that say like Fox and CNN. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Shutter going off. &gt;&gt; Uh Mr. Slime. Yeah. So uh I've always eaten really fast. Here's the thing about hot dog eating and let me break this down. I've eaten uh four now very competitively. Very fast &gt;&gt; in my life. &gt;&gt; And uh eating the hot dog meat shouldn't take you very long. You chew it and you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] swallow it. Yeah. And I don't know why that's hard. &gt;&gt; It would take me a while. &gt;&gt; The bun slows you down. That's why you when you put a bun in water, it essentially turns into liquid and you can swallow it like water. That's the trick. But if you do it too much, if you soak it too much, it falls apart in your hands and now you have a situation on your hand. &gt;&gt; There's a balance. &gt;&gt; There's a balance. But I could probably eat 10 raw hot dogs in like &gt;&gt; I think less than 20 seconds. &gt;&gt; Wait, I believe that. &gt;&gt; 10 hot dogs. &gt;&gt; 10 raw hot dogs. I think you could do it in less than 30. &gt;&gt; Wait, wait. No way. &gt;&gt; I I promise you the same size, Nick. I promise you. &gt;&gt; Are we going to bring doubt to the eater? I think you can do it in less than 30. &gt;&gt; I'll Uber Eat them right here. I will order them and they'll get here before the episode's over and you can do it right now. &gt;&gt; 10 of them. Do it. &gt;&gt; I'll do it right now. &gt;&gt; I'm not kidding. &gt;&gt; Hot dogs. That's a lot of hot dogs. &gt;&gt; We got like 30 minutes. &gt;&gt; We have 30. Oh, we're fine. &gt;&gt; Or we can do it on the primo. &gt;&gt; Uh, up to &gt;&gt; Yeah. Pay wallet. You know what? Just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] order it and we'll see. But I I can't I &gt;&gt; You want to watch me eat 10 hot dogs? Patreon. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Yeah. 10. We'll do it on the Patreon. I I can't stress how confident I am. &gt;&gt; Wait, you said 20 seconds? &gt;&gt; 20 seconds. I &gt;&gt; You're going to feel bad. &gt;&gt; I'll throw it up right away. I don't want to eat them. &gt;&gt; Feel good. &gt;&gt; It's too much salt. &gt;&gt; You're just going to throw it up? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Just to show you guys. It's like a magician. &gt;&gt; Okay. And now like a magician. &gt;&gt; And now the prestige. And then I eat 10 hot dogs. &gt;&gt; Shin pulling. He's he's like he's like he's like blowing vape smoke on his sleeve and like a little hot dog comes out. &gt;&gt; It's like cuts a pen and teller and they're like &gt;&gt; he's doing this and a hot dog is just emerging from thin air. &gt;&gt; Uh yeah, dude. The last when I saw Shin Lim, he had like some American Idol guy sing a song on stage while he did magic. But what if I'm there and I'm just eating hot dogs &gt;&gt; on stage tonight with Shin? &gt;&gt; You would be You would be a dope opener. Like if we got you to like open a Baby No Money show or something. We call in like one of our favorites and it's like now slime eating 10 hot dogs in 20 seconds. &gt;&gt; That'd be so crazy. &gt;&gt; Oh, that is such an insane thing. &gt;&gt; It's funny, too, cuz if you do something like that on a stage, there are people in the crowd that just want to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you. It's so &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's just like the human condition of like, well, that guy's important. &gt;&gt; If you do anything on stage, you can have sex after. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Anything. Anything. &gt;&gt; It's wrong. &gt;&gt; Anything. Anything. &gt;&gt; People were trying to suck Charlie Kirk damn dick. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; And now he's getting his dick sucked in heaven. &gt;&gt; And Yep. Now he's getting dick sucked by the Lord. &gt;&gt; And now he's getting dick sucked by the Lord cuz he was such a good Christian. &gt;&gt; Cuz he was such a good damn Christian. Now the Lord's sucking on his dick. I was like when I rolled up when I rolled up and then I opened the gate and Anthony was outside. He's like he's like Mr. Wayne. And I was and I was so shook up. I was so shook up. I I was like I Well, my balls were drained from lemonade stand. But I got to the door and I was like Alfred in my head I was like Alfred I need you to come in and beat me off. I need to Alfred I'm going to need to I need to come in the next 30 minutes. Dude, I bet Alfred gets really good at what he does. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; I guess I'm just a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You're just a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pale cow. &gt;&gt; Bale on [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] France. &gt;&gt; Oh, make you sad. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. We want We want you to come, man. We want you to come. Don't No, don't do You know what's funny is uh uh we don't even have a place to stay yet. &gt;&gt; What? We don't have a place. &gt;&gt; We got to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] figure it out. Airbnb cancelled my account. I don't know why &gt;&gt; at Airbnb. There was a there was a place that was like gorgeous. Like literally the most gorgeous place. It was the cheapest place on on Airbnb. I was like, I don't understand. It says it houses 10 people and it's on a lake and it was like so beautiful. I'm like or obviously booking this. It's cheaper than everything else. Everything else was so buttass. Book it. The guy's like, "It's not available." I'm like, "Well, that's why it's up cuz people probably keep trying to book it &gt;&gt; and it's not available." &gt;&gt; Uh, you are not allowed to sleep in the house. They don't want America. &gt;&gt; Oh, we'll see. Maybe, maybe we're going to have to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; They [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cancelled my Airbnb. I don't know why. I got an email. They said, "We're closing your account. I haven't used it in a year. I didn't do anything wrong. I'm not turning tricks like that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] woman outside the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in her shack that she made." &gt;&gt; That not even made up. &gt;&gt; I was at the wedding &gt;&gt; and I I looked at my phone. I saw you said that. I showed it to &gt;&gt; Wait, it's a woman turning tricks. &gt;&gt; Is it women in STEM? This is &gt;&gt; This is good. &gt;&gt; Yeah, dude. It's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up for this. It's this it's this new homeless woman that's near the the encampment that is near our studio and she built a house very close to the studio. The closest house &gt;&gt; I want to be so clear. This shit's not a tent. &gt;&gt; It's not a tent. &gt;&gt; It's not a tent. It's a structure. &gt;&gt; It's a house. &gt;&gt; There's like somehow she found like a big door. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; There's like a door, but basically there's always like two guys standing outside kind of waiting and they're all they're always looking around. So, she's either selling drugs or she's turning tricks. And I don't think she's selling drugs. Uh because I don't think &gt;&gt; if you're if you watch the podcast and you're a cop, um for every the 40t vicinity around our building is the gay zone. &gt;&gt; And if you show up &gt;&gt; and if you show up, you're &gt;&gt; and there's like there's there's no dogs here. So, it's like you wouldn't even &gt;&gt; there's that little one. They're going to turn it into a blood. &gt;&gt; No, he's not. &gt;&gt; He's not here. They are going to satellite strike that little dog. Oh my god. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Calling in reinforcement. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; There's two dogs. &gt;&gt; Cop in full gear just like one of the dog there's this there's two dogs. One was a puppy. One one was bigger and older. And then the same breed. And the little guy he for for a while last year was just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on the other dog a lot in our neighborhood. found out has Good Eats. &gt;&gt; That's his mom. &gt;&gt; No way. &gt;&gt; He was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] his mom. &gt;&gt; He's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on his mom. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; Found out from the neighborhood that that's his mom. &gt;&gt; And she It was so funny cuz the woman who told me this came out of her building and she's she was looking at it and she's like she's kind of shaking her head and looking at like not talking a and she was just like and and then I went over to her to talk to her about something else and she's like they just shouldn't be doing that. I was like, "What? What do you want?" &gt;&gt; Oh, she's right. &gt;&gt; What do you want me to do, &gt;&gt; dude? Oh, that sucks. Uh the the There was a homeless encampment that it was near my girlfriend's house that they had chickens. I think they were slaughtering chickens. They were alo selling drugs. And I don't think they were turning tricks cuz there was nowhere to nowhere to do it. But but there was like there were security guys. It was funny like guys that work security for like casinos or shows. They come up in their like their safety vests. Yeah. And they come and they show up and then they leave very quickly after putting something in their pocket. I'm like, "All right, he just cpped." But there's also chickens. Like these people are raising chickens and I think slaughtering them, which is kind of crazy. &gt;&gt; There used to be uh the the R the RV that was here for a long time. &gt;&gt; The RV was here for a long time. &gt;&gt; They were selling meth out of it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it got pulled. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, the cops have been cracking down a bit. Uh, have you noticed Mr. White? He's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] his mom. Mr. White, &gt;&gt; Mr. White is not cool. It's not right. &gt;&gt; Mr. White, you shouldn't be doing that. Mr. White, Jesse, &gt;&gt; just let him [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] his mom [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we want. &gt;&gt; I am the one who [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; I'm the one who [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] my mom. &gt;&gt; We needed I need to land this plane. &gt;&gt; I need to land this. &gt;&gt; There's no plane, bro. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it. The pilot's gone. &gt;&gt; I don't know. No, I I was making this joke. I was making this joke that dude, our our neighborhood's going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] man. Because not because we have a bunch of homeless people and we've had homeless people the whole time we've been here long before us. &gt;&gt; In fact, they were so everybody who lived around this building, it was a bit of a it was a very nice, chill community. Nicer cars than Nick Giggling. &gt;&gt; And then something changed in the last 6 months. I don't know what it is, but all of a sudden the the packages started getting stolen and and the cops started arresting people and pulling cars. What happened to the old the old nice encampment that I used to know? &gt;&gt; So, I think what the encampment did wrong is they would have really big bonfires. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm realizing what the problem is. &gt;&gt; That was a problem. &gt;&gt; Well, no, no, no. I I'm realizing what the change is. &gt;&gt; The ice cream truck stopped coming. &gt;&gt; Did it? Right. The ice cream truck hasn't been showing up to the office. &gt;&gt; No, it was at the school. It was at the school like a little bit ago. &gt;&gt; No, but it doesn't roll around. &gt;&gt; It used to roll through our street. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The music and you'd be like ice cream trucks here. Everyone's probably I crime rate going up. &gt;&gt; Dude, is that is the ice cream truck the harbinger of order and peace? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Everybody has a reason to live. That little Spongebob ice cream with the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up gumball eyeballs. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he's all melted weird. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; That's why I said that guy's dick looked like on the subreddit. That's what that guy Aiden in Lemonade Sand interview kind of look like. One of those uh like Sandy Cheeks. &gt;&gt; They need to turn Ned and Yahoo into one that melted Sonic ice creams. &gt;&gt; Mhm. Get that guy. Dude, that was when I won the hot dog race. It was funny cuz right before that there was you see the donations for Fast 52, which was a great event by the way, but I'll never tell Lewig that cuz he's not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] here. True. And uh and it said I was sitting there just waiting for the hot dog to start and it just said $250. Arrest Netanyahu &gt;&gt; and I know what they wanted to say because the thing on Twitter is Netany and Yahoo. That's what that's what everyone says. &gt;&gt; This is go this is a thing on &gt;&gt; Well, that's well that's the thing on Twitter. &gt;&gt; That's the hashtag. But they couldn't put that part because there's some sort of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] draconian language filter. And uh but after the hot dog race, I said arrest yahoo. And came up to me after he's like, "So that one's a bit tough." And I'm like, "All right, man." &gt;&gt; Lwig at the UN meeting. Can't we all just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] get along? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh I don't know. I think we should all just be pog. &gt;&gt; Yeah. the United Arab Emirates guy at the UN Security Council. He's like, "Who's the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fat guy?" &gt;&gt; Maybe the glue. &gt;&gt; He's not the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I mean, he's somewhat dude. We've been gooning on [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] League of Legends for goddamn weeks straight. We [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] suck. We're We're goons. &gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Don't say we &gt;&gt; No, me and him. I'm not talking about you. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Ding balls. &gt;&gt; I don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You're not a good boy. You run it down in [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Counterstrike. You make fun of Yinglang for [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] queuing with Yousef. &gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz that sack's dooming his elo. &gt;&gt; All he does, dude, Yingling is in the pissiest of moods. He logs on and he's so mad because his friends run it down in Counterstrike and he's not Aiden's not there to carry. &gt;&gt; So, do something for me about my ace this morning. &gt;&gt; You had an ace this morning in the AM. &gt;&gt; This morning? Cool. Cuz I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] And you know, I had a bunch of time. I had a bunch of time. Lord, Lord knows I had time this morning. &gt;&gt; Lord knows I &gt;&gt; time I carved out. &gt;&gt; Yawn, dude. Y we didn't do the podcast early. &gt;&gt; Probably better. &gt;&gt; It is funny though because Yingling has this is the stage that we went through is Yingling would see me play Counterstrike and he was like, &gt;&gt; I'll play with you if you buy me a skin &gt;&gt; and I was like, I'm not going to buy you a skin. I don't I would just say play Counter-Strike if you want to play Counterstrike. And then he would come over to me every day. is like, "Just buy me a knife." &gt;&gt; He just buy me a skin. &gt;&gt; Yeah, Yingling wants him to buy it and just let let him hold it. &gt;&gt; And no, but he he he had to be negotiated down. He's like, "What if you bought the skin and you still owned it, but I I just borrowed it and and then I would be like, "Nope." Hasn't changed my opinion about that. So, we go about two months, two months of this process to which he just caves and starts playing Counter-Strike. He's like, he kept gambling like I'll learn some lineups if you give me the skin. I'll play more if you give me the skin. And now we just play. No skin involved whatsoever. &gt;&gt; You held out. That's That's the art of the deal. &gt;&gt; He's your Discord kitten. &gt;&gt; But what happens is my Discord kitten when I get offline and I don't like this and I'm thinking about kind of bringing the hammer down on this is he disappears. This man hops back into the lobby and his ELO's gone down 2,000 points and it's because he's queuing with the poop plot. Dude, the poop plot. He will say like he's he tells me stories about it and he's like, "Yeah, I just went non-verbal and then I just ran it down so the game would end." He's in a game with four of his friends. &gt;&gt; That's so crazy. &gt;&gt; I rolled up when we were about to I came into the office and he's playing Counterstrike and he's he's down he's at his desk and he's he does this thing when he's sad is you know when Yingling's gaming and he's super attentive he's very locked in like he's straight back at the computer very focused &gt;&gt; and I walk in dark room he's fully leaned back in the chair and he's just going he's just moving his arms a little bit. I look at the score. They're down 102, &gt;&gt; dude. And then I'm I'm over there eating my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] my food and I just hear Aiden start laughing in Yingling's face &gt;&gt; cuz he turned around and he looked at me. He looked up. He looked up like this and he just he just rolled. He just shook his head back and forth. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; I left the room for two more minutes. I came back. He lost the game 132. &gt;&gt; Dude, gaming is so back. &gt;&gt; Gaming's back in. &gt;&gt; That's why I don't want to go to France. There's no reason to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] go to France. &gt;&gt; We can go to the awesome Vitality esports lounge and we can play there. &gt;&gt; Do you mean it? &gt;&gt; Mhm. The first night in Paris. &gt;&gt; I did have fun. &gt;&gt; Is it still there? You think? &gt;&gt; Probably. That team's doing well.

Real [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] It will &gt;&gt; just a slouchy lol cow. &gt;&gt; You are my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] posture. &gt;&gt; Your posture is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up, dude. We make fun of the way you sit when you can't hear us all the time cuz you have your big stupid headphones on and you like you're pointed like a political cartoon. Like you know how you know the features. Zipper, can you just look up any political cartoon with a like a person in it? &gt;&gt; Librarian. &gt;&gt; How sick. &gt;&gt; Librarian political cartoon. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. You just like &gt;&gt; it's the back hunch, &gt;&gt; dude. Is that a Supreme jacket? What are you, Tyler the Creator? What is this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Supreme sweater. &gt;&gt; It's just a sweater. &gt;&gt; It's a It &gt;&gt; It does happen to be Supreme. &gt;&gt; I'm wearing chain mail, &gt;&gt; but I bought it at a &gt;&gt; I'm wearing chain mail. I can beat the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of you. &gt;&gt; I bought it at a thrift store. &gt;&gt; That's what That's what That's what puts a lot of stuff in perspective with me with you. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Is that you? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Tell &gt;&gt; No matter how much like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] money you spend on stupid ass clothes, &gt;&gt; this cost $50 &gt;&gt; or how right really for P. They fell off. Supreme is not all expensive. &gt;&gt; They failed off. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; you buy a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] $50 sweater and you think you're all that and you have a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Apple Watch and all this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dumb [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in your life. But the thing is, dude, I could I could beat the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of you. &gt;&gt; I could beat the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of you and you couldn't do anything about it. &gt;&gt; No, you couldn't do &gt;&gt; I would [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] punch you. I would punch you. I'd punch you and then I' I'd start I' I'd push you back. It would knock you out. and push you back enough and then I'd start I'd start peeing on you and you wouldn't know what to do and then I would I would piss on you like Miles Teller pissed on me in that dream. &gt;&gt; You'd piss on me &gt;&gt; and you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and you'd [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] get all mad that I'm peeing on you and then I'd call you a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] L cow and I'd say you drink my piss cow and I would win the fight. &gt;&gt; I would win the fight. &gt;&gt; You could take him in a wrestling match. &gt;&gt; In a wrestling match. &gt;&gt; You got the long arms. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think the long arms might help. What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is a long arm going to do when I break it in two? &gt;&gt; He's got It's wrestling. You don't get to break his arms. I get to do whatever I want. It's wrestling. &gt;&gt; It's wrestling. There's rules. &gt;&gt; What are you talking? What's the rules &gt;&gt; of wrestling? Like in high school wrestling? Like wrestling? &gt;&gt; Well, okay. He's trying to restrain me with his arm. I use my force to break his arm. &gt;&gt; Then you'd be like, "Okay, Aiden wins by technicality cuz you broke his arm." &gt;&gt; The guy with a broken arm is not winning anything. &gt;&gt; Yes. If you &gt;&gt; You fine. You can say whatever you want. If you say, "Oh, that guy won." And he's holding his arm screaming. I'm like, "Okay, fine. I'm a loser." I guess &gt;&gt; it's like it's like okay it's like if you're boxing and you kick someone in the nuts and they keel over. You can't be like I won the boxing match. You broke the rules. &gt;&gt; That's different. You don't hit someone. &gt;&gt; It's the rules. &gt;&gt; You don't hit someone in the nuts. You just don't do that. &gt;&gt; It's the rule. &gt;&gt; You don't break someone's arm. &gt;&gt; Spiritual rule of humanity. &gt;&gt; But if like if it's wrestling and he's trying to kill me with the rules spiritual rules of humanity count here, but not the rules of the game. &gt;&gt; I'll never hit you in the nuts, but I'd break your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] arm instantly. Okay. &gt;&gt; If I had to. But &gt;&gt; but you can't. If I'm peeing on you from a distance, there's no way you get to my heart. &gt;&gt; This pee strategy. I feel like it would just make me more mad. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But I'm I'm also mentally shaking you cuz I'm calling you a LOL cow while you do it. &gt;&gt; I just start getting really hesitant. Yeah. I will say this. If you aimed the pee into my mouth, I think it's like a boss eye and I go down. Do you know when you know when you play Super Mario Sunshine and you're fighting like Pety Piranha and you kind of get the you aim the flood and you have to hit it into his mouth over and over again? I'm picturing that's what it would be like. &gt;&gt; If you piss in my mouth, you win &gt;&gt; cuz it's so embarrassing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then I stomp your And then I ground pound your belly. &gt;&gt; I think if you piss in anyone's mouth, you win no matter what you're doing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's a lot of &gt;&gt; universal constant of life. In a debate, you pee in their mouth. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; Debate. Do you think that's what the US when they vote on the Gaza thing at the UN Security Council, do you think the US rep is actually just he's peeing in everybody's mouth fast enough and that's why that's why it's &gt;&gt; unmistakable somehow one to 19 or whatever and we keep getting away with it. &gt;&gt; Maybe that's why. Yeah, we're just we have the best pissers. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm sure some piss tastes good. &gt;&gt; 100%. &gt;&gt; Can't all be bad. Well, I I think I told this before, but one time me and my friend made a concoction of like almond extract and things we thought would get us drunk, and then our pee smelled like sweet delicious butter. &gt;&gt; Like, it smells really good. &gt;&gt; Don't you have sweet pee if you have like &gt;&gt; you don't deal with your diabetes properly? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. If you have like a disorder or like bad blood diseases, then you can have sweet pee. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh, &gt;&gt; cuz your kidneys cuz your kidneys aren't doing the work. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Or no, wait. Yeah. &gt;&gt; What? Okay. What if for the final episode of The Yard when you go and leave to Sweden, we all drink each other's pee? &gt;&gt; I'll do that. &gt;&gt; Cheers to us. I love how he's like, "Where I'm going, this is just &gt;&gt; this is just a regular. &gt;&gt; This is like orange juice with your breakfast." &gt;&gt; Maple syrup urine disease. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. I have a the I'm dead ass. I'm I'm dead ass. &gt;&gt; Okay. My best friend growing up &gt;&gt; sounds good. &gt;&gt; He's type 1 diabetes. His dad has type 1 diabetes. &gt;&gt; I spent maybe half of my time between sixth and 12th grade at his house or like maybe sixth and like 10th grade because they were like my second family. Every weekend we'd like stay up. We play like Yu-Gi-Oh. We'd play video games. That was like where our friend group landed. Dude, his house smelled like maple syrup all the time. I'm dead ass. Okay. &gt;&gt; It smelled like a thick maple syrup for years and I wonder if it has to do with that. &gt;&gt; Are you still in touch with this young man? &gt;&gt; Yeah, he was the guy whose wedding I just went to. &gt;&gt; No way. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And the smell it smelled like that for maybe like five or six years. &gt;&gt; It would imply that they're like not flushing the toilet though. I feel like &gt;&gt; maybe it's seems weird, right? Cuz if it only has to do with pee, then like you think &gt;&gt; it's like the cabinet of like jelly donuts and stuff that they're eating. &gt;&gt; Like this is strong. That's Lwig's house has right now. &gt;&gt; They didn't have No, that's that's only if you get the factored jelly donut planner. &gt;&gt; That's it. Lwig loaded right now in in his medicine cabinet is just jelly donuts and he just grabs one, eats it on the toilet while he takes a dump. &gt;&gt; Do type one and type two folk have beef with each other. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think one of them you got to let go. Yes. &gt;&gt; If you got type two, it's a bit of stolen valor. Don't you think? &gt;&gt; It is 100%. Yes. Type one people are probably like, "Fuck you, bro. I was born with this shit." Try eating your way to type two to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a girl with the type one. Yeah, type one. I got that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] too. Had the whole time. What are you doing later, by the way? You want to get awesome pizza? &gt;&gt; Do you Yeah. Do you want to get some sort of very neutral food? &gt;&gt; Is is the person is his wife diabetic? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; So, they're race mixing. We're okay with that? &gt;&gt; Yeah, dude. &gt;&gt; Yeah. A bunch of the family actually didn't show up cuz it was &gt;&gt; so contentious. &gt;&gt; So contentious. &gt;&gt; Really contentious. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, I'd have a problem with it, too. &gt;&gt; When was the last time you guys had pigs in a blanket? &gt;&gt; Yeah. You were saying how this fell off. &gt;&gt; I think it fell off. &gt;&gt; Pigs in a blanket. Uh, &gt;&gt; you know what's crazy? Cuz &gt;&gt; they're so good. &gt;&gt; Well, we said this and then Lwig said cutie makes it all the time. Yeah, cuz it's like a Easter tradition or some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; And I think that that's when I had it. &gt;&gt; She made it for us &gt;&gt; when her her silly ass made them. &gt;&gt; She made it. I think it was at her what? I think it was at the Super Bowl party this year. She had some &gt;&gt; pigs in them like it fell off. Oh, I had I had another thing that fell off. It was so good. Cuz it did, but then I forgot. Probably because it fell off. &gt;&gt; It was so good, but it fell off. &gt;&gt; It was like a good like damn That did fell off. How good can it be if it fell off? &gt;&gt; Well, that's what I'm saying. And it was like, damn, that used to be like the wait, we measure how much a fall-off is impacts us by how much something was. &gt;&gt; The little [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; little water toy that you put your penis in. &gt;&gt; I will say I never put my penis in. &gt;&gt; But you know exactly what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; But I know exactly what you're talking about. &gt;&gt; I wanted to put Hold on. I put my penis. &gt;&gt; We put our penis. &gt;&gt; I didn't put my penis because you know why? I didn't have one. It was always someone else penis. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You were watching all the kids in the schoolyard put their penis in it. &gt;&gt; They weren't putting their penis at the schoolard. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And under the monkey bars &gt;&gt; just dropping dick into the weird flashlight that they just gave kids. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That thing fell off. &gt;&gt; Uh snap. &gt;&gt; It did fell off cuz I I feel like it's like the kids are probably just getting their own flashlights now. &gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz they're cheap. &gt;&gt; Her boobies fell off. &gt;&gt; That fell off huge. &gt;&gt; Everyone was just wearing like Armstrong bracelets. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Livestrong.
