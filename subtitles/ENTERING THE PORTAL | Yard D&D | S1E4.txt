 You now have a new mission, which is apparently recovery. &gt;&gt; I heard her. The princess. I heard her. What'd she say? I'm I'm here. I can feel a teleporter nearby. I want to roll athletics to charge as fast as I can down this corridor. &gt;&gt; Human skin comes up and all over Gore. The second mass of skin wraps up around Ran also. &gt;&gt; All right. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this. Get me out. Hello and welcome to the yard episode 4. You all are in a tunnel. Everything's going fine. Don't even worry about it. Two of you in the process of actively being crushed, possibly digested and dragged away by boneless. Uh the skin and clothes of two guards that you were in pursuit of while Stone Beard uh and Leonus are looking on. Everything's fine. There are two zombies that are on fire, actively coming towards you uh as your friends are being dragged away in your desperate pursuit of Princess Selenia. Uh this brings us back around to the top of the next round when Gorg, you hear a &gt;&gt; Bro, we said no phones. &gt;&gt; It's the sending stone that Showsy gave you. Hey, baby. Everything all right? Hey. Hi. Hi. &gt;&gt; It's really bad. &gt;&gt; What? What do you mean it's really bad? Like, is is is GJ okay? &gt;&gt; Uh, yeah, I think so. We're in a guy &gt;&gt; right now. &gt;&gt; You have my baby in a guy. &gt;&gt; We're in a guy. &gt;&gt; Are you on the phone? &gt;&gt; The the sending stone literally, it's like a little red gem. Uh, and while you're trying to talk, GJ's head pops out of your shell, takes the sending stone, and shoots back in your shell. So, you hear's voice. &gt;&gt; Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. &gt;&gt; Georg, what is happening? &gt;&gt; You're talking to the kid, &gt;&gt; and you hear coming from just the whining noises coming from GJ. &gt;&gt; So mad, &gt;&gt; I need a strength saving throw. Okay, before I do, I want you guys to know, I know you can hear me. I've never admitted this. I have a fantasia. &gt;&gt; You can't imagine. &gt;&gt; And I can't see and imagine things in my head. And I can't imagine what your faces are like right now. And I'm very scared. &gt;&gt; What apple are you? &gt;&gt; I I don't see the apple stone bread, but I want you guys to know if this is it for me. &gt;&gt; Damn, he's a five. I wish that I could see your faces in my mind, but I cannot. &gt;&gt; Am I also in a guy right now? A vag. Okay, the both of you have been wrapped up and are being dragged towards a portal at the end of the tunnel, and the two flaming zombies are coming uh the other direction, basically trying to block the tunnel. But first thing I need strength save is this boneless zombie is trying to crush you. All right. So, as long as everyone knows that, I'm going to try to use my strength right now. &gt;&gt; What are you talking about, Jordan? &gt;&gt; 12. &gt;&gt; Gord, how you doing? How you doing on those headpoints, Jorg? &gt;&gt; They're pretty They're pretty low, Horizon. &gt;&gt; You you you you hear the the ocean spray off in the distance as this thing crushes in on you for another five hit points of damage. What the hell is happening here? &gt;&gt; It's fine. It's fine. &gt;&gt; So, you can fight back, but again, because you are physically wrapped up in this thing that is squeezing you to death as it is dragging you away. When you attack, you attack with disadvantage, which means you roll twice and take the lower of the two. &gt;&gt; Oh, there's one that's really good. It's 25 and then 20. &gt;&gt; Uh, that is more than enough. &gt;&gt; Uh, this thing is undead. I assume you would probably like to smite it. I would love to smite it so bad. &gt;&gt; Give me Give me your damage roll for it here. &gt;&gt; That's a four. And then welcome to the coup dead couples, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. 6 + 5 &gt;&gt; 19 &gt;&gt; is 11. And then eight is 19 plus the four that I rolled here. &gt;&gt; Gorg, as you are being dragged away and crushed to death by this thing, tell me what it looks like when you destroy it. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. So they're like watching, right? &gt;&gt; I'm not watching. I'm in a guy. You're in a &gt;&gt; He's objectively not watching. &gt;&gt; Objectively still in a guy. &gt;&gt; He doesn't have affantasia, so he can imagine what happened. &gt;&gt; Little puffs of smoke coming out of its ears if it has those. &gt;&gt; And you guys are like, damn. Like this might be it, right? I'm assuming. And they're like Gorgi's like it's over, dude. Like we're never going to see our like best turtle friend like ever again. &gt;&gt; And it's really sad. And they're like, "Fuck, mate. He's going to pull through that portal and they're going to like rip his turtle bones open and make like soup out of it. And all of a sudden out of the guy's like stomach it starts to like get all pregnant and big and he's like and like you can see and then the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] trident, dude. My vicious stride just bursts out of him, dude. And there's like goo. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it's like &gt;&gt; it's like the Matrix. &gt;&gt; It's like the Matrix. It's kind of like I'm being reborn. You feel an overwhelming sense of pride from GJ, like that's my daddy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Coming out of you. And guess what? You have a second attack. Your friend is in the exact same predicament. There are also two the the remaining essentially meat from these people that had their skin torn off, which is actively on fire. It's also there. &gt;&gt; He has killed the the thing he was wrapped in. Correct. &gt;&gt; And you guys look at me and you're like, "Wow, it looks almost like a newborn like christened baby." Well, you look bad. Well, I look rough. I My hit points are low. &gt;&gt; A great hit, Gorg. &gt;&gt; Stone Bread. I can see your face. &gt;&gt; I'm in the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] guy. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Run. Do you want me to kill the guy? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'd like that. Well, don't kill me and the guy. I want &gt;&gt; I want to be I want to be alive when I come out of the guy. &gt;&gt; Can you even die? &gt;&gt; It's It's complic Yes, I can die. It's complicated. It's also racist to say that. &gt;&gt; Do you just go home? &gt;&gt; Still, you got the best jokes. Do you ran? If you want me to cut you, if you want me to break you out of that guy with my vicious stride, can you say please? &gt;&gt; I I I accept what my fate now. I'm realizing I'd rather be in here than out there. &gt;&gt; Just save him. &gt;&gt; All right, fine. &gt;&gt; Fine. All right, I'm going to attack &gt;&gt; this time. You don't have to. It's not uh disadvantage, so go for it. &gt;&gt; 18. &gt;&gt; Uh, that is enough. Are you going to smite this one, too? &gt;&gt; I'm going to smite this one, too. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Yes. Five plus. &gt;&gt; That's my big cobra boy. &gt;&gt; That's my boy. &gt;&gt; I do 14 damage. &gt;&gt; Perfect. Same thing. These things have already been beat on. So, tell me what it looks like when you when you save your friend. I went and like the goo is just like flying off like like like when you're driving and like the water's on your windshield and it's just like kind of goes on the side and the goo is just like coming off me and like goo disgusting. &gt;&gt; And then I do &gt;&gt; saying goo goo goo goo goo goo goo goo goo goo goo goo goo goo goo goo goo goo goo goo goo". &gt;&gt; Yeah and then I do like a twirl and then I say and then I whisper in ancient Toral language that sounds a lot like Japanese. This one's for Horizon, which would sound like &gt;&gt; Horizon. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The light. &gt;&gt; And you're just ex and it explodes all around you and you're just like, you come out and there's just like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Does he Does he get me out? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Let's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] go &gt;&gt; on you and you're just like &gt;&gt; like there. &gt;&gt; My hair is down like I've been in a pool. &gt;&gt; They look bad when they come out. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh, &gt;&gt; they're hard to look at. &gt;&gt; That's That is That is just your attack. Technically, you theoretically have a bonus action. Anything else from uh from Gorg? &gt;&gt; Um, I can't lay on hands myself, can I? &gt;&gt; You can, but I believe that is an action, not right now. &gt;&gt; That's true. We charge extra for that, but &gt;&gt; that is a long rest. No, I'm good. I end my turn and I I do a cool pose and then a Japanese symbol appears on my back. It's inexplicably GJ jumps on your shoulder and goes like nobody even taught her that move. She just she just knows it, you know. She knows she knows. &gt;&gt; Yeah. She knows to hit her mark. Yeah. Uh, perfect. All right. So, you were loose. There are two zombies left coming down the hallway. What would you like to do, Ran Kaladus? &gt;&gt; Okay. I'm I'm unchathing two goo goo goo goo goo goo goo goo goo goo goo goo goo goo goo goo goo goo goo goo goo cover covered swords and I want to use one cuz one of them's too gross to hold at the moment. You're going to attack with your short sword of life stealing, which I just like saying out loud. &gt;&gt; But maybe to the makers of D and D shorter phrase for that. &gt;&gt; Excuse me. To the makers of D and D. Longer phrase like the short sword of life stealing awesomeness. &gt;&gt; 18. &gt;&gt; Uh, more than enough. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So dam. &gt;&gt; Big dam. Big dam. Uh, six. Not that big dam. &gt;&gt; You stab into this thing and you see just like a hunk of it fall off, but again it is completely unfazed. uh is it's it's been burning long enough in this oil and fire that it's actually kind of like kind of pleasant honestly, which is offputting. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'm out. I'm It's good. I don't want to do that again. &gt;&gt; It's good meat. &gt;&gt; However, &gt;&gt; nice little short rib. &gt;&gt; It is literally a short rib cut out. Like literally. Uh it is however the zombies turn which uh one is going to attack Leonus which I don't think an 11 is going to get it done. Uh so just swings and one comes at Stone Beard again with a big old three basically blinded by the flames uh in misses completely. &gt;&gt; This is honestly pathetic. &gt;&gt; It is your turn. Uh to be clear, I am facing the portal trying to piss into it, &gt;&gt; wondering where it's going. &gt;&gt; However, because you previously set them on fire, roll 2d4 for me here for your uh recurring flame damage. &gt;&gt; Don't know how to read this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Well, why do you &gt;&gt; four and two? &gt;&gt; How do you know? Because the base the bottom number. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Like the one that's facing up. Four and two. &gt;&gt; They're all facing up. &gt;&gt; No. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] The one you can read, not upside down. &gt;&gt; Leave it all in. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; beard, are you drunk? &gt;&gt; Suggest, &gt;&gt; Stone Beard, your dice. &gt;&gt; Oh, guys, the fire damage. &gt;&gt; You see one of these zombies again, collapses to the ground in a smoldering heap, and then gets up again, uh, and stands back up, still actively burning. Uh, but it is your turn. &gt;&gt; They keep coming back to life. &gt;&gt; Yes. Ran, you you have familiarity with these things. These are kind of the the lowest possible uh uh members of the undead totem pole. And it just basically takes catastrophic damage. Like they they are fairly frail. They are fairly weak. They just don't stop. That that is basically what they do. Just takes massive damage essentially. I would like to do a strength check because I would like to pick them up and walk them to the portal and throw them in. &gt;&gt; I love it. Uh I believe you were previously raging. So that &gt;&gt; I was raging. &gt;&gt; That would be athletic out. &gt;&gt; Uh you roll with advantage. So you roll twice and take the better one. &gt;&gt; Okay. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; That's so weird looking at looking at his lips. &gt;&gt; Oh, 22. Uh, with no skin, it's kind of hard to know which one of these guys was Riley and which one was Bejorn. Uh, but you all see Stone Beard just kind of hits a single leg on both of them and kind of charges down the tunnel. Uh, roll a D4 for me here. &gt;&gt; Three as you take three points. You're there. It's like uh you take three points of damage as the burning oil uh that you covered these things kind of gets on you. But you will see he runs for a little while and as you get closer you can see it. It it just looks sort of like a gateway there. But it's just sort of like swirling darkness on the other side and &gt;&gt; they're gone. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's crazy. &gt;&gt; Dude, those guys [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sucked. &gt;&gt; You're so fast and strong. &gt;&gt; They're they're from they're from a place where I'm from called it's called Bakersfield. &gt;&gt; So they don't know any better. &gt;&gt; Bakersfield my Bakersfield my Baker the Mory Denny's. that has all the flies in the lobby. Sounds beautiful. &gt;&gt; Rowan, can I ask you a question? Have you ever Do you ever come across any undead turtles? &gt;&gt; No, dude. What is it? What is it to you? &gt;&gt; Cuz sometimes I think about after all this and I end up undead, you know, if I'll have friends there. &gt;&gt; I don't think you're going to end up undead when you die. I think you're just going to die. &gt;&gt; But you're undead. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's like my blood. &gt;&gt; You have blood? &gt;&gt; Do you have blood? &gt;&gt; Guys, can we focus? So, bro, that was cool. &gt;&gt; There's a portal. &gt;&gt; What do we do? &gt;&gt; I don't know. I put my hand through the portal. &gt;&gt; Is it warm or cold? &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's kind of like &gt;&gt; It's kind of cold. &gt;&gt; Kind of like a chillier, but I can't tell if that's a me thing. &gt;&gt; I don't like cold. I don't If we don't like &gt;&gt; You don't like cold? &gt;&gt; Yeah. I feel like you would like cold. &gt;&gt; All of you give me perception checks. &gt;&gt; Uh, seven. &gt;&gt; No, it's really chilling here. &gt;&gt; Uh, hand, no hand. Hand, no hand. &gt;&gt; 13 total. &gt;&gt; Perfect. &gt;&gt; Weird. didn't come out after in the portal. &gt;&gt; 18. &gt;&gt; 18. Perfect. &gt;&gt; Five. &gt;&gt; You know, Gorg, &gt;&gt; you just kind of hear showsy &gt;&gt; like um uh you hear just sort of like happy grunting from GJ and she's like, "Well, I I guess this means everything's all, you know, it's I called you during work. I just call me back later." And it just like goes off. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. Oh my god. Thank god. &gt;&gt; It could have been so bad if I died &gt;&gt; on the phone. You hear through the portal. &gt;&gt; Oh, did they just throw him back? Uh, okay. That's That was a choice. I hate these things. &gt;&gt; There's someone on the other side. &gt;&gt; No one's touching me. &gt;&gt; He keeps doing that. &gt;&gt; Okay, take your hand out. Take your hand out. I don't take your hand out. I don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'll put your hand through. When you put both hands through Stone Beard, you feel somebody give you a double high five like &gt;&gt; on the other side. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; yeah. I told you there's some there's something over there. &gt;&gt; Guys, &gt;&gt; are you a little scared now? &gt;&gt; Guys, listen. Someone in that portal. &gt;&gt; Wait, &gt;&gt; right. Yeah, &gt;&gt; somebody says there's someone behind there. &gt;&gt; I don't think they're menacing. &gt;&gt; You know, I appreciate your intuition. &gt;&gt; I sense kindness. I will say your weapon of warning is not currently rattling. Who wants to go first? &gt;&gt; Hey, how's that? How's that that that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] little sword you got or whatever. Is it Is it vibrating? &gt;&gt; Sh what? Don't call it that. It's a acts of warning. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's an act of warning. &gt;&gt; You would hear it, too. It goes &gt;&gt; We all think there's a cool name for it. &gt;&gt; Stone Beard, I'll go through the portal first. &gt;&gt; Leon, I think we I think we should have Ran go first. &gt;&gt; One of your grievous injuries on the side of your face. You see GJ is trying to like lick it like she's trying to help. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh, hey. I'm okay. It's &gt;&gt; You feel just concerned. &gt;&gt; I hate how you control my emotions, cat. Do &gt;&gt; Do I recognize the voice? &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; actually, hang on one second. Let me give me insight. Either either insight or history, whichever is higher. &gt;&gt; Insight. &gt;&gt; Uh 11. &gt;&gt; No, it could be anybody. &gt;&gt; All right. Well, before we go in the portal, &gt;&gt; you look bad, &gt;&gt; dude. Does anyone have something to like a turtle like a turtle soup? &gt;&gt; Excuse me. &gt;&gt; Soup for turtles. It's I don't know. How dare &gt;&gt; you? A soup of to soup for turtles. &gt;&gt; It's a crazy thing to offer. &gt;&gt; If I said dog food, you wouldn't assume I'm feeding the dog. &gt;&gt; Yeah, because at the tavern I I campaigned to have what was her name? &gt;&gt; Calamity. &gt;&gt; Calamity to not serve turtle soup cuz it bothered me so godamned much. &gt;&gt; It's not turtle soup. It's turtle soup. You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; It's fine. You know what? You're an older guy. It's like a thing. I don't have any turtle soup for you, but I can use my healing spirit to heal some of your HP before we go through the portal. &gt;&gt; I've got some turtle MREs. &gt;&gt; You want one of those? &gt;&gt; It's like hurtful to talk about. Dehydrated meals are bad for one in years. &gt;&gt; Leonus, &gt;&gt; you might have grown up with those totals. If you want if you want to help me, I will accept it. I'm fine pretty much though. I got &gt;&gt; You look bad. &gt;&gt; 6 HP. &gt;&gt; You look bad. &gt;&gt; You look bad. I will uh since we have this moment and it takes a minute to get going, I will use my healing spirit uh channel that like green inner energy, stand up next to Gorg and uh and roll for my healing. &gt;&gt; Are you Is it Are you moaning before or after? &gt;&gt; I've done this before. It's like an MRI. I uh I rolled two. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm ready for you, Leonus. I'm ready. I'm so ready. &gt;&gt; You hear that? He's ready for you, Leo. &gt;&gt; I think I kind of gas out a bit. &gt;&gt; What is your wisdom modifier? &gt;&gt; My wisdom modifier is plus three. &gt;&gt; So, it can do this three times. &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. &gt;&gt; Like, if you're in combat, it's round to round, but since you're out of combat, it just kind of happens. &gt;&gt; Okay. Um, so six more. So, seven total. &gt;&gt; Okay. Eight. So I &gt;&gt; eight total. &gt;&gt; Can you get it over with? He's I feel like he's enjoying it. &gt;&gt; Oh, bathe me. Bathe me. Leon. &gt;&gt; I don't like when you talk to me while you do it. &gt;&gt; Wait. So you just want me to be silent when you bite? &gt;&gt; I take the healing power back. I &gt;&gt; You're psyching me out. You know I need to focus when I do this. &gt;&gt; All right. Can we stop? Can we focus? &gt;&gt; Yes. Sorry. &gt;&gt; I I healed you for eight points. &gt;&gt; I want us to be serious. Oh, &gt;&gt; that was you. &gt;&gt; Damn it. I was getting healed. &gt;&gt; You have to go in the portal first. &gt;&gt; Oh, turtle slowest. shocking. It's a total. &gt;&gt; This is how we got into this jam, by the way. Me charging through. You sure you want to do this again? Cuz I'm down. &gt;&gt; I would like to roll athletics to charge once again. Full speed. &gt;&gt; I tie a string to you and I'm holding the other end of the string. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Tug twice if it's safe. &gt;&gt; Okay. Got it. &gt;&gt; Tug as hard as you can if you need help. &gt;&gt; Probably won't get a hard tug. &gt;&gt; I I don't mind a soft tug, &gt;&gt; but like one tug probably not going to happen. Two tugs safe. let you guys know. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he's going through the portal, man. &gt;&gt; Okay. Our Mer Athletics, you're letting him give tugs. Oh, dude. It was so close to a 20 11. &gt;&gt; Uh, it's serviceable. He, you know, it you it would have looked super dope, but your quads are kind of cramping. There's just a lot of dude goo on the floor. &gt;&gt; I need salt. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it it's sort of like he kind of like stumbles but gets it back together kind of and there's just like like you're running on a slip and slide. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Like it was much cooler in your head. uh than you thought it was. &gt;&gt; It's like &gt;&gt; and nothing happens. The rope stays taut, but you don't feel a tug. &gt;&gt; I reach out. I cut the string. &gt;&gt; You cut the rope. &gt;&gt; Well, without him noticing. &gt;&gt; What the Give Give me slight hand and give me notice. &gt;&gt; And give me perception. &gt;&gt; I I want him to stay in the portal. &gt;&gt; Dude, yours is so high. &gt;&gt; 13. &gt;&gt; Very masculine. And Ron is like I'm like I'm like &gt;&gt; Yeah. What was that? Hey, &gt;&gt; no. That's it. &gt;&gt; What's that? &gt;&gt; That's it. What's Why you have a book? &gt;&gt; Yeah. After every single fight, I rank you guys. &gt;&gt; I mean, I don't care. But what &gt;&gt; am I high? &gt;&gt; But what does it say? &gt;&gt; Did you Did it Did I get high this time? &gt;&gt; You got better than Ran? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Thimble appears on your shoulder and it's like I had a Rome. &gt;&gt; Yes. Look, it's all chest bump. Chest bump your face. &gt;&gt; Well, no tug. I guess we got to I guess we got to get out of here. &gt;&gt; I won't say this to his face. Gorg is first right now. I'm following him in. &gt;&gt; Meanwhile, Gorg, while all of this is happening, as you charge through here, much cooler in your head than you thought. &gt;&gt; It was so cool when I did that. &gt;&gt; You come out in a forest. Uh, it is dark. The trees are gnarled and bent. Um, but almost like not just burned like they were caught in an explosion. And you see wreckage. Wreckage like from the old stories of the invasion back during the war. But for the most part, you never see these things. They were cleaned up and repurposed long before you were born. Uh but just twisted war machines that are just kind of like crushed up and smashed into the ground where like a cataclysmic battle happened here. And up ahead of you, you see two figures. They are tall live men wearing silk suits. One of them in white and one of them in black. And on the ground in front of them are the two zombies that are still just sort of smoldering. like clearly they just kind of succumbed to the fire. And one of them looks at you and he says, "Okay, listen. We've been instructed to bring you all to our lady. Or if you don't want to cooperate, we can have fifth cuffs here. Although, did your other companions die in the tunnel? We were led to believe there were four of you." &gt;&gt; I'm like mass. I'm just tugging on this string as hard as I can. And you very much realize that it's just like &gt;&gt; and then I'm like and I put it behind my back and I'm like yeah there are it's not even four there's 10 of us. &gt;&gt; Oh 10 of us &gt;&gt; hope you're scared now [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You see one of them like they're both standing on the ground and one of them just jumps straight up onto a branch of a tree and just sort of lays back a little and the other one takes out a fan and is like, "Do you like a moment to collect yourself? You seem a bit um rumbled." &gt;&gt; Uh, can I roll to scream really loud to make them hear me through the portal? &gt;&gt; Give me performance plus uh and I'll give it to you with advantage. &gt;&gt; I roll 11. the exact second that you're like, I'm going after him. &gt;&gt; Well, well, look, I don't hear anything. So, &gt;&gt; wait, I know. I hear Gorg. It sounds like it's safe over there. He's just doing a small muffled riot. Almost like a Please go. &gt;&gt; Do you want me to go in first? &gt;&gt; No, but I do want you to follow shortly behind and ran. &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; you do whatever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you want. &gt;&gt; Well, now that you don't want me to go, I kind of want to go. &gt;&gt; Athletics check. It's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dirty 20. &gt;&gt; How do you make a just boss entrance? I turn around. I face Ran. I say, "Do whatever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you want." And then I jump into the portal backwards. &gt;&gt; It looks really cool from their perspective. &gt;&gt; There goes my hero. &gt;&gt; We don't know that song. &gt;&gt; You know, it's very popular amongst the fighters of food. &gt;&gt; Great. Elvin other guy. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; It came from Bakersfield my media scrolls. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Everybody has that etching when they're growing up. Gorg, you see Stone Beard just back out what probably was a pretty good mic drop on the other side. &gt;&gt; Oh, he did the backflip. &gt;&gt; Gord, what up, baby? &gt;&gt; What's up, dude? I The uh the string it broke, but everything is not great. &gt;&gt; We're the ugly [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Yeah, they uh they're super menacing. I was about to do Divine Sense. Um but then you came and now I'm glad you're here and it's good to see you. &gt;&gt; My name is Stone Beard. Name yourselves. your stonebeard. Wonderful. We were told to keep an eye out for you in particular. And note, your axe is not ringing. Uh, Stone Beard. However, this is particularly awful for you because you haven't seen weapons like this in a century. Uh, again, they they were cleaned up. It it is exactly like uh the Blitz of London. And once the war was over, all that thing was taken away, but people know it happened. Uh, but this is the equivalent of at the risk of mixing metaphors, like there's like actively wrecked zeros, like actively wrecked panzers that have just sort of like been left to kind of rot here in a scene that you've not really witnessed. Um, and as you're looking at them, they say, um, your friend's a rather pitiful liar. He said there was 10 of you coming. Um, are there two, are there four? Are there 10? We just don't want to have to give the same speech multiple times, you know, just in efficiency. &gt;&gt; 20, maybe 20 even. I But I said there was a lot of us. &gt;&gt; I said, "Who are you?" And &gt;&gt; what's this wreckage? What? &gt;&gt; Meanwhile, back in the cave, Stone Beard made his dope exit. Uh, what are you two doing? &gt;&gt; Uh, it's not really ever just us two. It's kind of It's kind of weird. Uh, &gt;&gt; am I used to saying just with you? &gt;&gt; I It's Leonus. &gt;&gt; I feel like we don't know how to talk to each other. &gt;&gt; Does he want to make out? &gt;&gt; I need to follow Stone Beard. &gt;&gt; I'm going to follow Stone Beard now. &gt;&gt; Uh, yeah. You can go in first. I don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] care. &gt;&gt; I don't need to do an athletics check to go in the portal, right? I just kind of like uh I'm just going to I'm just going to go in the portal. &gt;&gt; To be clear, you're making this awkward. I'm being normal. &gt;&gt; I'll see you later on. And I I just kind of, you know, kind of shift around. &gt;&gt; That's not a no to making out. And you you uh go through the portal, leaving you alone, ran. &gt;&gt; All right, fine. I walk in right after. &gt;&gt; Same thing. You all see the scene as described with one difference. Um for you, Ran, you're sure this is my &gt;&gt; I knew that. But nowhere you've ever seen like again it it shouldn't be. Mory cleaned up the stuff the fastest because quite frankly so much of it was repurposed for the infrastructure of of the kingdom. So there still shouldn't really be a place where there's just stuff like this strewn about. Even though you immediately get a sense of the vibe of home. I pull I pull an unlit cigarette off my necklace and light it on the smoldering ground and feel feel good to be back. &gt;&gt; Hello new friends. Uh so four six more. &gt;&gt; Six more coming baby. &gt;&gt; I got my bow ready. Stone beard. &gt;&gt; Have you seen these two? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I've seen them. Hold hold hold the bow. Hold the fire for a moment. &gt;&gt; We're just waiting to give the speech till everyone's here again. One of them is up on the tree just like literally just laying on the branch chilling and the other one is on the ground with the fan. &gt;&gt; I said there were 10 of us cuz I was scared and the string broke somehow. So I was trying to make sure that they were going to freak out. &gt;&gt; String broke. It's weird. &gt;&gt; I know. It's so weird, bro. &gt;&gt; How about we just give the speech and you all can repeat it. Um &gt;&gt; yeah, we will. I'll get I'll I'll stone will repeat it to our cohort. &gt;&gt; I'll repeat it to the whole cohort. &gt;&gt; I'm Minkx. This is Barricade. Um sorry about your men in there. Um in both of their eyes start glowing purple. Riley and Bjorn were means to an end, but you seem to have dealt with it. Yes. Um our lady Coette Strega left us here to invite you for an audience. &gt;&gt; You said Minkx. &gt;&gt; Yes. I'm Minkx. &gt;&gt; What was the other one? &gt;&gt; Barricade. &gt;&gt; Barricade. Two Rs. &gt;&gt; Yes. Very kind of you to ask, actually, you know. And what was your name, good sir? &gt;&gt; You know my name. It's Stone Beard. &gt;&gt; Well, you mentioned it momentarily, but it's as a gentleman. I just want to be like, "Oh, Shante being Stone Beard." Um uh yes, we've been given um permission by our lady. If you all would rather engage in combat fist to cuff such as it is, we can or we can escort you safely. Hence, really, it's up to you. &gt;&gt; And where are we? &gt;&gt; And he they both just immediately turn and look at you, Ran. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we're in my for sure, but I don't recognize any of this place. &gt;&gt; Is this Bakersfield? &gt;&gt; Uh, it it kind of looks like Bakersfield. &gt;&gt; He's from Bakersfield. Oh, that explains so much. &gt;&gt; No, I'm not from Bakersfield. I just &gt;&gt; How many fist fights in the Waffle Irons parking lot? Have you engaged, man? &gt;&gt; Yes, their dogs smoke weed there. It's crazy. But that's not the point. I want to know where we are, too. Where specifically are we? &gt;&gt; Yeah, Barricade. Why are there Why are there old technologies here from the war? He looks down at all of them and he says, "Ah, yes, you um you were there. So few of the youth remember these days." And um we just thought it was important that there be a memory that remains. And as you were looking at these things again, they are horrifying. Every corner is jagged. Uh they are covered in spikes and just protrusions meant to do harm. Uh one of them has a ram uh on the front of it that has been like driven into the ground and like dug a deep trench uh behind it. &gt;&gt; Makes I I you know as as a young stunner back in the day uh I I have a fantasia so &gt;&gt; dude. No one cares. &gt;&gt; It is actually very helpful for me because I was never able to visualize what the war was like. This is horrifying. And I got to say, it's kind of a macabra type of thing. Me and Leonus, we both came up in the same time. We've only read about this stuff. &gt;&gt; You're telling the two strangers that you're a visual learner. I understand you. How did you even visualize your big breasted god? &gt;&gt; That was Well, I mean, it it she appeared to me. Are we interrupting something? &gt;&gt; Sorry, sorry, sorry. I What I meant to say is what a horrifying tribute. &gt;&gt; Leonus making a new rake. &gt;&gt; We've establish. &gt;&gt; What are you writing, Stone Break? &gt;&gt; We've established Leonus was a pretty good kid. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But when you were growing up, there was a time that you went out a little further than you were supposed to. probably one of the first times you sort of instinctively began sensing a portal when you didn't even know what that was. It just something was calling you somewhere. And there was a cave where you would have seen one of these wrecked vessels, just a relic of the war. &gt;&gt; Uh but in Leo. &gt;&gt; Yeah, in Leo when you were young in the ocean. Wrecked in the ocean. Um wouldn't the owners have told anybody? I think I as a child see seeing that I know that my uh father and grandfather were connected to the war. They weren't very explicit with me about what they were doing or what they did, but I know they were involved. So, I think seeing that I was smart enough of a kid to be like, "Hey, what like ask them about it, ask my dad about like why that would be there." It would have been one of those things where again as we've established, you know, you your dad was a man of few words and didn't really understand you, but it was one of those things. &gt;&gt; But &gt;&gt; it was like it it's nothing. Don't even worry about it. And yet mysteriously, you were never allowed to go back there ever, ever. &gt;&gt; I would say some years later, you probably did. And you found that not only was that thing gone, that cave had been collapsed in. Like protracted effort had been made to like remove any um hint that it had been there. And this is the first time you've even seen anything similar. Both of these guys are very fppish, but you see Barricade's face kind of becomes a little straighter when you say it's such a terrible monument when he says it was a terrible time. Yeah, but why did you make it? &gt;&gt; We didn't make it any more than you made this. And he motions to the burning corpses of the zombies on the ground. It's like we made sure that it remained. It's a preservation &gt;&gt; to remember the war. So I ask you, if you preserve the memories, then why do you cause more war? Why do you fight? Why do you kill? Did you send the zombies in after us? &gt;&gt; Did you not say you were with &gt;&gt; coga cos the back? &gt;&gt; Ask her name. It's not very relevant to us. &gt;&gt; It's relevant to us. Yes. &gt;&gt; Coette killed dozens and dozens of people. &gt;&gt; I mean, &gt;&gt; they're sensitive to the death thing. &gt;&gt; Just let us not insult each other. All of us have killed many people and we'll kill many more. We're part of a Peace Corp, &gt;&gt; are you? &gt;&gt; Yes. I'm I fight for Horizon. I kill for Horizon. I kill for good. &gt;&gt; Killing for good is like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for virginity. &gt;&gt; That was kind of bars. &gt;&gt; I like it. Yeah, I'm slightly impressed. &gt;&gt; Sway. You you see Barricade hops off the tree and again effortlessly like 20 ft down just lands and he's like are we correct in assuming that we are going to behave like gentlemen and we can deliver you hints if you just like to walk and talk. &gt;&gt; Where are we being delivered? &gt;&gt; Uh for an audience with our lady &gt;&gt; Coette. &gt;&gt; Oh now our name matters. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Our lady coette streak. &gt;&gt; Coette Stroga. I grab I grab stone bread and I'm like, "Bro, let's just let's just cut their heads off, dude." They were talking about how we kill for good. This is good. I don't care. &gt;&gt; What's the point in killing them? Ultimately, we have to meet Coette and get rid of her anyway. She's the one who killed dozens of people. &gt;&gt; What are you guys whispering about? &gt;&gt; Strategizing the &gt;&gt; strategy of what we're going to do here &gt;&gt; alone. &gt;&gt; You can get involved with talking. &gt;&gt; Like, what do you want to do? &gt;&gt; They're like, "Respectfully, we're not listening." Can I ask you, have you have you seen a princess yay high? &gt;&gt; Oh, the ears. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh uh, have you seen a princess about this? This tall? &gt;&gt; Oh, yes. Princess Selenia. &gt;&gt; You've seen her? &gt;&gt; Yes, we kidnapped her. &gt;&gt; Hey guys, I think they kidnapped her. &gt;&gt; Where is she? &gt;&gt; She is with Kit Striga. &gt;&gt; Oh, let's go there. We have to go. &gt;&gt; And yes, to your qu. Yes, we left those. &gt;&gt; We'll go, but we're leading. &gt;&gt; We Don't rent. Don't &gt;&gt; I'm really sorry about him. &gt;&gt; We don't know. &gt;&gt; We don't follow them. &gt;&gt; He's He's been buying like a new creatine, not drinking water. It's like a whole brain thing. &gt;&gt; Kidneys are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; We can't trust them. &gt;&gt; He's like, "True, but if we simply wandered you dead, would we not have orchestrated some sort of ambush here? &gt;&gt; You sent zombies through a portal at us &gt;&gt; and you saw what we did to them?" &gt;&gt; That is not completely accurate. We left zombies on the other side of a portal. Um, once Riley and Bujorn were no longer of use to us, we simply recycled the materials. &gt;&gt; You killed Riley and Bujornne, we won't follow you. &gt;&gt; We couldn't have any witnesses. &gt;&gt; Riley had two cats. &gt;&gt; I liked Riley. Bjorn was racist. &gt;&gt; Bjorn was very racist. &gt;&gt; Was racist thing. &gt;&gt; In my experience with cats, they will move on quickly. &gt;&gt; And what about racist? &gt;&gt; I believe that is a check on our legendary. We've rid the world. in being hard on Bujorn and sometimes you watch the wrong media scrolls and &gt;&gt; sometimes fall down you fall down you go down a bit of a media scroll rabbit hole Leo the algorithm picks what you want &gt;&gt; the algorithm chooses the scroll &gt;&gt; library algorithm &gt;&gt; you say you want to read the scroll &gt;&gt; algorithm just keeps showing up scrolling &gt;&gt; the library of the Nexus will give you some crazy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] accidentally clicked on the scroll next to the scroll I wanted and and she handed me a cookie and and I don't &gt;&gt; I'm trying to watch Five Nights at Frederick's and then all of a sudden &gt;&gt; Jordan of the Peterson reading up on his scrolls. &gt;&gt; Five guys named Frederick show up. That's not what I'm You guys You guys remember when Gorg went through that year period where he was keeping his room like really clean? &gt;&gt; Really cleaned his room all the time. &gt;&gt; Honestly, it was a good year. It was a lonely year, but it was a good year. You see, um, uh, Minx walks right up to you, um, Stone Beard, and simply points at the axe and says, "Your weapon warns you of danger." Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And yet it is not warning you about me. Yes, &gt;&gt; it's true. &gt;&gt; And like he looks at you and his eyes glow bright purple and he like pulls his teeth back and you see he has fangs. He's like, "I am dangerous, just not to you." Now, &gt;&gt; that's my issue. I can tell you're strong, and we went through a battle. I'll follow you, but I get one free hit. &gt;&gt; I mean, he gets one free hit. &gt;&gt; One free. &gt;&gt; I love when he doesn't &gt;&gt; deal. &gt;&gt; Nice. &gt;&gt; Uh, and he's like, "Shall we? Yeah, we can walk side by side then." Yes. Right. &gt;&gt; I'll take it wherever you want. &gt;&gt; Some &gt;&gt; That's how you get those scrolls. That's what it was. That's how it starts. Stone Beard, give me a history check. &gt;&gt; 15 in it. &gt;&gt; You've heard these guys accent before, but you can't quite place it. It's like It sounds kind of like quaint and oldtimey, &gt;&gt; but not particularly sure where. &gt;&gt; You were in the war. &gt;&gt; Yes. For who? and the two of them started walking. &gt;&gt; My bad. &gt;&gt; I was a freak. &gt;&gt; Can I Can I roll a perception check? Cuz obviously this is the place of Stone Beard's war that he was in. He thinks about it a lot. He sweats cold all night. &gt;&gt; I want to see if he's okay, but I don't want to ask him. Insight, but I'll give you advantage cuz you care about you, bro. So, same thing. Yep. Insight. &gt;&gt; I may use this to make fun of him, by the way. &gt;&gt; Oh, that 20. &gt;&gt; So, before we resolve that, uh, again, to give you an idea, this was essentially a world war of which this was like a battle, you know, it's like a a battle in in in the theater. Um, now that being said, Insight is not mind reading Stone Beard, but he is gonna have a pretty good assessment of where your head's at right now with a natural 20. &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; I'm just looking at him. I We're We're walking a bit. We're following these people and I'm just like looking at you. &gt;&gt; Why are you looking at me all weird? &gt;&gt; And I just like bite my like turtle lip and I'm like, "Is this bothering you being here?" I won't lie, the ships did stir me a bit, but I didn't fight in this battle. It just reminds me of the battles I did fight in. &gt;&gt; You're like kind of sweaty. &gt;&gt; Feel like I told you how I feel. &gt;&gt; Well, you're kind of sweaty. I'm just I'm just making sure. &gt;&gt; That's also hot. I'm still enraged. &gt;&gt; You are enraged. &gt;&gt; My nipples are out. &gt;&gt; The pepperons. &gt;&gt; The pepperons. Okay. Hey, you need to talk to your old friend Gorg. I'm right here, bud. &gt;&gt; Appreciate that. Yeah, &gt;&gt; GJ flies over and like lands on you and just sort of like curls around your neck a little bit and just kind of like puts her head up under your chin and just like vibrates purring &gt;&gt; as my cat son dog &gt;&gt; daughter &gt;&gt; as you go down that list of adjectives just &gt;&gt; a jolt of what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] man just like she like looks at you like &gt;&gt; all right I'm sorry &gt;&gt; I keep trying to make eye contact with while we're walking &gt;&gt; the bonding moment and before the portal. &gt;&gt; I can feel his look in my periphery. I'm not looking at him, but I know he's looking at me. &gt;&gt; So, can I just kind of take a swing or &gt;&gt; Oh, now you you want to resolve that now? &gt;&gt; Well, when were you thinking? &gt;&gt; Well, I mean, probably when we get to the point that we fight to the death and like, you know, I'll tear your head off. I just didn't know that that was &gt;&gt; Oh, we're going to fight. &gt;&gt; Presumably. I mean, like, we know you all and how you operate. &gt;&gt; They They didn't kidn kidnap a princess. That's kind of the act one of the story. Cuz maybe when we're in the fight, they'll be like, "No, doubt anymore." &gt;&gt; Why shook on it, sir? &gt;&gt; That counts for both of you, right? &gt;&gt; And Barricade looks at you and it's like, "Absolutely not. I did not consent to any such thing." &gt;&gt; I stop moving. &gt;&gt; Uhoh. I hate when he does. Is he Is he doing this? &gt;&gt; He's no You're in trouble. You're in trouble, man. We need to get the princess. &gt;&gt; It's I'm literally a one hit is pretty good. &gt;&gt; Do what you want with the princess. I don't even care. You don't have to care. &gt;&gt; I don't care. &gt;&gt; You know, the funny thing is he kind of means it right now. &gt;&gt; I served in war. You think it matters? &gt;&gt; Do you have a dude? &gt;&gt; I was a general. You have a dude. Are you taking the piss? &gt;&gt; Sounds like he's taking the piss. &gt;&gt; Or you taking piss where, man? Can you just Can we just keep walking? &gt;&gt; Yes, I can take the cooperative members of the party. &gt;&gt; Yeah, leave them behind &gt;&gt; then. Sure. Yes. &gt;&gt; I'm not leaving. &gt;&gt; Come here. Come on. Give me a free hit. &gt;&gt; They gave you one. You got one free hit. Barricade comes close and he's like, "Oh, are you so afraid that you think you need two free hits? Is that what you're saying?" &gt;&gt; Respectfully, &gt;&gt; I'll win a battle anyway. I need to. &gt;&gt; Great. Win it over there. And they both start walking. Stone Beard, I think you should come with us. &gt;&gt; They kind of mogged him. &gt;&gt; They mogged him. Stone Beard mogged. I'm a little rattled. I don't like seeing Stone Beard get mobed cuz he's kind of in my, you know, he Stone Beard is what I aspire to be in a lot of ways. So, seeing him get mogged is fractures a sense of myself. &gt;&gt; I will say Thimble is just like, "Yo, did he just get bodied?" Did Did that just happen? I I don't I feel like he's not he's not himself right now. &gt;&gt; See, he's like holding it. He's like faking him, right? He's like robeing. He's just like, "Oh, &gt;&gt; you wanna be um Leonus again." As you all are walking, give me either nature or survival. &gt;&gt; Survival. Oh, nine total. &gt;&gt; Super distracted. I guess it kind of makes sense that you you're more thinking about Stone Beard right now as you all are walking. Um as you will kind of uh make your way through this again um this like desolate area uh that is almost like like a like a time capsule even uh mory is common misconception people think the sun doesn't rise in my course it does it is usually kind of overcast because there's a lot of smoke from the factories and things like that but this place &gt;&gt; industry &gt;&gt; is very dark um it's like the clouds seem seem um ominous. Just like all of this looks, it's almost like being inside of a more like being inside of a crystal ball, even though you're aware this this is home. And as you all are walking up ahead, you see the remnants of what was probably once a fortified settlement. There's sort of the ruin of high walls uh that have been like burned and pockedmarked by explosions and things of of some great cataclysmic battle. Uh there's places where the wall is completely broken and you can see it it fell. Um and there's some of the structures inside are still standing and in the middle there is what is unmistakably would have been an old elven keep. Um, but the kind that would have been built centuries and centuries ago, even if it fell like a hundred years ago, it it would have stood here for much much much longer. &gt;&gt; Do I feel do I feel any connection to this because it's Elvin? Like would I have any recognition of this or because we're in Mory? &gt;&gt; Well, because of that survival, you don't. So, &gt;&gt; what what it means to you, I will leave. What it means to you? &gt;&gt; Okay. Do I have anything or do I have any insight? &gt;&gt; Same thing. It's uh my um it does border Waldane. Um I mean it it borders a few different kingdoms. It was a word where the the Elven Kingdom um but you've kind of been along that border. You've been along the border to Mory and Waldane together in fact. And like you there's no recollection of anything like this. &gt;&gt; This is a dump. I'm looking around looking to see if there's an undead toral cuz I'm just fascinated and scared at that idea. You do see just sort of shambling mindless undead kind of in the woods just standing there and not doing anything in particular or just sort of like &gt;&gt; Bros crashed out. &gt;&gt; They're crashed out. &gt;&gt; Bro crashed out. &gt;&gt; Me. &gt;&gt; I feel like he gets to make that joke. &gt;&gt; Crashed out. &gt;&gt; Doesn't watch doesn't watch Aiden. L &gt;&gt; what? Who's Aiden? Don't go to that part of the media scrolls. &gt;&gt; He's a He's a live scroller. &gt;&gt; Just got a quill. The words are just appearing. &gt;&gt; People just reading it like, "Oh, &gt;&gt; when we uh when we went through the portal, did we go back in time? &gt;&gt; Give me either either wisdom or intelligence check. Whichever is higher." &gt;&gt; Oh my god. Okay, now I know what you mean. &gt;&gt; That happened to me. Uh, three. &gt;&gt; So close. &gt;&gt; It was It was so close to not 20. That's how it goes. &gt;&gt; It rolled around the rim. &gt;&gt; Yep. They mess with you. Uh, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Maybe. &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; guys. I hate it here. I hate it. It's weird and it's cold and you're always mean and I feel like everyone else going to be mean. &gt;&gt; Everything here looks so dated. And I don't know if you guys have ever been to Mory, but everything pretty advanced in Mory. We're like &gt;&gt; we're kind of like China of this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; I mean, last time we went to Mori was in the war. It looked like this. It looks the same. &gt;&gt; No, it it's extremely like advanced. &gt;&gt; I was here. It looks the same. &gt;&gt; He was here, dude. &gt;&gt; I was here. &gt;&gt; Okay. Oh, okay. Don't trust me on this then. I guess &gt;&gt; he's only from there. &gt;&gt; You know, I'm not from [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] from here, &gt;&gt; right? Just saying. Well, this guy's been there. Trust me, bro. You've been there. You have some You have a necklace of cigarettes. Been there. Yeah. What you say, &gt;&gt; Stone Bread? What happened to the string when I went through the portal? &gt;&gt; Don't cut it, &gt;&gt; dude. &gt;&gt; Dude, dude, &gt;&gt; you cut the string. &gt;&gt; It's just That's just harsh, man. Like, somebody takes the time to like tie the rope. You're supposed to &gt;&gt; You spend a few months with a turtle following you around. Sorry, Turtle. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; I saved you &gt;&gt; from the guy you were in. &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; The guy. &gt;&gt; He did save you. &gt;&gt; Lowkey felt a little bit good. I won't I didn't want to say that. I didn't want to have to say that, but it felt it felt a little bit good in the guy. &gt;&gt; Sounds like he learned something about himself. You're welcome. &gt;&gt; I &gt;&gt; I'm not going to touch that. &gt;&gt; Not for like not in like a &gt;&gt; cuz why is he as a man? &gt;&gt; Fine. Whatever. I'm just saying I hate it here. Let's &gt;&gt; All I'm suggesting is that I don't know what day it is and what time it is. &gt;&gt; Minks, what day is it? &gt;&gt; Um forging day and I forgot. &gt;&gt; Yeah. 14 days. &gt;&gt; What year is it? &gt;&gt; Hooray. Um, it's it's you you haven't gone through time or something. You do know that, right? &gt;&gt; I don't know that. &gt;&gt; You seem oddly suspicious of it. I I have a number three in my head. I I It's all the only number I can see. I'm wondering if that's the year I'm in. &gt;&gt; I wish I could see that. I can't see. &gt;&gt; No, we are not in the year three. &gt;&gt; Okay, good. Um, ironically enough, I made this world up. I haven't given it a year. It's the year 677. Yeah, there we go. That's the year now. &gt;&gt; So, why is everything so old? He just sort of uh stops and then turns and looks at you and he says, "I would think you would understand better than most um that some of the shorter lived races have a skewed perspective on time and how we get where we're going." Right. &gt;&gt; Of course. Of course. Their brains work ours. &gt;&gt; That sounds totally rational. I'm not okay. I'm like normal for a toortal &gt;&gt; height. &gt;&gt; We just believe it is important that the sacrifices of the past be remembered and honored. Not everything is meant to be recycled and paved over and renovated. Some things should just remain, right? And we kept the smog. They look up and they say, "You really don't know much about how the war ended, do you? You apparently don't know much about how the war actually ended." &gt;&gt; You don't think I know how the war ended? &gt;&gt; Again, trust me, bro. I I sure. Yes. That fine. And then both of us keep walking towards towards the fort. &gt;&gt; I think we're getting somewhere, guys. I think we're really I think we're really annoying these guys enough to where we can get a second hit for Stone Bread. We need I think we need to hurry up and find the princess. &gt;&gt; We're walking. &gt;&gt; So, what &gt;&gt; happened in the step? &gt;&gt; They uh as as they walk along for a second. Um you see, one of them looks at you and he's like, "You were in the southern theater, right?" &gt;&gt; Right. So, you really don't remember the Wildfire Brigade? That is a name you would remember. You know, these two individuals mean nothing to you, but the Wildfire Brigade were uh uh they were um elven intelligence out of Waldane. &gt;&gt; Of course, I remember the Wildfire Brigade. They're half the reason we won the war. &gt;&gt; More than half. She'll explain everything. Just come on. So, Coette was in the war. &gt;&gt; Yes, she was. Still, I don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about Kette. He killed They killed us. She killed all the &gt;&gt; She just looks really good to have been in the war. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; And we don't. &gt;&gt; No, you look warish. &gt;&gt; Cheek is missing. &gt;&gt; So, we look warish. I mean, how much did this guy drink today? Is there anybody keep a score? &gt;&gt; Next question. &gt;&gt; Six als totally appropriate number of midday. &gt;&gt; It isn't thinking six midday. um is you will start coming down here uh into the town. Uh Leonus and Gorg, even though it looks fairly deserted except for like the odd zombie kind of shambling around, the two of you are aware of the fact like there's like a lot of zombies in this town. Most of them are in the buildings. Um but there's a bunch of them around. &gt;&gt; Just just for number wise, can I use divine sense? &gt;&gt; You absolutely can. I just want to get a sense of what we're I want the radar scan to show &gt;&gt; dozens maybe 50. &gt;&gt; Pop popping your toral UAV. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm like he's on a kill streak. &gt;&gt; We got to re We got to rebuild windows. &gt;&gt; This is really bad. If if it comes to blows, there are so many undead here and my Trident is only so thirsty. &gt;&gt; If it comes to blows, you all leave. &gt;&gt; No, we leave you. kind of the whole kind of the whole thing we do is we're like &gt;&gt; we're like the group of four peacekeepers there. &gt;&gt; Someone needs to bring back this information. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'll do it. &gt;&gt; GJ, &gt;&gt; my cat daughter. &gt;&gt; If it comes to blows, GJ leaves the group. &gt;&gt; If I may, Stone Beard, &gt;&gt; Thimble, &gt;&gt; who they've all they all know exists at this point. Thimble, why if something goes bad, &gt;&gt; Thimble can just go do it. &gt;&gt; Thimbleimble's I want to go down with you, man. I got down first and invisible. You're perfect for bringing the information. You're perfect for staying for I just I'm I just want to bang to the end to the end fight. Like she's literally a baby. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on then. Stand back and stand by. [Laughter] Minkx turns and looks at you and he's like, "Before we take you to meet with our lady, would you would you like to send a sending to someone? Was there a call you'd like to make him?" &gt;&gt; No, we're waiting for the information from the lady &gt;&gt; and then I think you're going to attack us. So, we're planning for that. &gt;&gt; What? No, &gt;&gt; he won't attack us after that. it. I mean it I feel like our interactions will only end in violence. Uh but it will not be initiated by us. We will not ambush you. Good sir. &gt;&gt; I trust him. &gt;&gt; I think I trust him. &gt;&gt; All right. Where's Kat? &gt;&gt; From inside the temple. You hear or inside the uh fortress rather? She's like I'm in here. &gt;&gt; Stroga come out. &gt;&gt; Strega. Oh, thank you, &gt;&gt; Sria. &gt;&gt; Yeah, there's four there's 40 of us out here. Are you scared? &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; that's that doesn't We're like We're right here. &gt;&gt; There's only four of us. They know. We have no cohort. &gt;&gt; I would I would tell if there was more. &gt;&gt; But maybe you like can't be &gt;&gt; We fight with the power of &gt;&gt; You also You changed the number. You changed the number &gt;&gt; because the bigger the number, the more scared they are. &gt;&gt; You said a different number to the in the goalpost like how do you &gt;&gt; cuz I'll freak out and be like oh my god we can't come out let's give the princess back &gt;&gt; how how have you survived previous missions &gt;&gt; I recently was in a guy and that was &gt;&gt; it was lifealtering yes &gt;&gt; which wasn't that bad &gt;&gt; it was it was terrible we've all had long deployments and sometimes you've just got to do what you've got to do &gt;&gt; he knows &gt;&gt; I did I I did a tour on a guy it Doesn't need to be deployment related. Sometimes you you love who you love. &gt;&gt; Very wise beyond your elven years. Sometimes you just love who you love and have to fight who you have to fight. That's that's just a thing that happens. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; Great. Uh they just continue walking along and uh the two of them go into the fortress, but you all are kind of outside uh in the courtyard. &gt;&gt; So what? We're in the courtyard. There's a giant fortress. They go in. Coat's in there. &gt;&gt; That's That's where the voice came from. &gt;&gt; Sorry. We're like within the walls of a of a space already. &gt;&gt; Basically a ruined settlement. &gt;&gt; I don't like this guys. &gt;&gt; Is your axe vibrating? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. But I want you to do something &gt;&gt; you with the vibrating axe. &gt;&gt; No. What? &gt;&gt; Sorry. &gt;&gt; I want I want you &gt;&gt; We might learn something. &gt;&gt; I want you to shapeshift &gt;&gt; into what? &gt;&gt; I don't know. Just go in disguise. We'll go. Just the three of us. &gt;&gt; Okay. I turn into one of the zombies we saw earlier. &gt;&gt; Oh, you're good. He's good. Well, tell them you went to smoke a cigarette or something. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Crash out zombie just kind of right outside. Just go see. He just fits right in. Uh, so I split up. &gt;&gt; Perfect. Uh, let's say you hang around. Um, again, even though this is a fortress, as you um get up close to it, even without making any of you roll, you can see that it probably was on the other side of a losing battle. Um, that again, you know, the the the fence is held for a time and then ultimately gave. Uh, even as you kind of walk through the door, you can see that once there would have been like big wooden doors could be barricaded that have like kind of buckled and warped and worn down over time. And as you come into the room, uh, in the middle of the room, you see Princess Selenia. She's sitting on a seat. Um, she has red roses in her hair and is now over the gown. And she was already wearing like a a blackish chain mail shirt has just been draped over it. &gt;&gt; Princess. &gt;&gt; Ah, &gt;&gt; princess. &gt;&gt; Mory Samar. &gt;&gt; Hey. Hi. &gt;&gt; Are you Are you all right? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm great. &gt;&gt; You're great. &gt;&gt; I'm a zombie. Forgot. &gt;&gt; We are so sorry by the way because all that stuff happened. We were bickering six ALS and you &gt;&gt; before the &gt;&gt; got lost. You know, it's um I I don't I don't blame you. Um I knew what your shortcomings were. It's fine. &gt;&gt; Why does that word keep getting thrown around toward me? &gt;&gt; Come with us. Now, &gt;&gt; she stands up and she says, "Well, I will, but um I I need to to talk with you first. There there's some things that you need to understand that that I don't think that you do." &gt;&gt; Let's talk calamities. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we need to get out of here. It's happy hour in like 2 minutes. She's like, "It's always happy hour calamities." &gt;&gt; That's why it's great. &gt;&gt; It's great. &gt;&gt; That is That is true. Um, and zombies start walking out from all directions, but the difference this time, they're all in old elven uniforms uh, from the war. Some of them look like they must have looked the the day they died, like they've just been to sleep. They look freshaced and and calm. Uh other ones look burned and scarred. Uh some of them that were probably retrieved from water are nearly just gelatinous masses of flesh uh that just sort of like shamble forward and sort of surround you on all sides but get between you and the door outside. You would see that they kind of like fill in. &gt;&gt; Now that I I've seen one, I go and I get the clothes that they have. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I just add them to my my shape shift. you very easily could could enter into the crowd. And Selenia looks at you and her eyes turn purple. And when her eyes turn purple, you see two little dots on her neck just start to bleed a little bit. &gt;&gt; And she goes, "Um, listen, I won't insult your intelligence. There's still time for your girl. Um, but how she is going to come out of this is really up to you now. So, can we talk or are you going to do the thing that you do? &gt;&gt; Let's talk. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; It has coette taken over Selenia's body. &gt;&gt; You are adorable, Leonus. Like, I love watching the wheels turn in his head like he's just like this cute boy. You put two. I'm a &gt;&gt; The obvious thing that's happening is happening. Like we got there though. &gt;&gt; I've been a lot of different places and I recognize a lot of magic. Yeah. But we got there. &gt;&gt; Where's the actual princess? &gt;&gt; He's not there yet. He's not there yet. &gt;&gt; What happened to the princess? &gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] idiot. &gt;&gt; Just that is a very judgmental zombie. has &gt;&gt; uh Princess Laney's body, &gt;&gt; but Goit had a rocking butt. &gt;&gt; I I did until you stabbed it repeatedly. Yes, that's You don't remember that? I &gt;&gt; Yes, there was I was holding the sword and and then like poison came out of my mouth, but then I like shot all of you. Like that part was great. &gt;&gt; Okay, give the princess back. And she looks at uh Minkx and she says, "Oh, you a gold piece." He actually said it out loud and she like whips him a gold piece and he catches it and she goes, "Heroes, you you guys are very predictable." That's &gt;&gt; you guys are taking the piss. &gt;&gt; And you see she is sort of in the center of the room. Uh and Minkx and Barricade just kind of move over to the sides almost like points on a triangle type thing. Uh just sort of to you guys left and right. and she says, "I will make a deal with all of you." Um, and you see she looks at the three of you and she just sort of like scans the room clearly looking for you, Ron. But she doesn't give any indicator that she sees you. She's like, "To all of you, I will not harm any of you until one of you attempts to harm one of us. &gt;&gt; Give us a free hit, too." &gt;&gt; She says, "Hm." And she takes a knife out and she just holds it to Selenia's neck. She goes, "Sure, it'll be this one." &gt;&gt; The dorb bread mugged twice in a day. &gt;&gt; We swap it to I turn I turn to thin. I just think he's feels so off today. &gt;&gt; It's I mean, but like this is has to be like a lot of PTSD. Like &gt;&gt; I He just seems rattled. &gt;&gt; Well, but like a lot's happening. &gt;&gt; I'm a little embarrassed. &gt;&gt; Could I run Could I uh could I roll a stealth check? &gt;&gt; Uh you can, but it's going to be difficult. People looking right at you. &gt;&gt; Oh, no. Yeah, I'm trying to stealthily drink some of my flask. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; I've been I've been ghost puffing. &gt;&gt; Either stealth or slight a hand. Whichever whichever's higher. &gt;&gt; It's a It's a 23 &gt;&gt; easily. &gt;&gt; I whip out a really a really long straw. &gt;&gt; Coats just deploys this iron straw for you. You know what I mean? Just makes it look like she's scratching her ear. &gt;&gt; Like Graden putting his dip into his his cup in school. And and I I faintly hear what sounds like from the old scrolls Popeye music. It's a problem. &gt;&gt; Just uh just my mouth shape shifts back to my original mouth. Hey uh Stone Beard, what's the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] plan? Cuz it's kind of itchy in this thing. &gt;&gt; So, what do you want to talk about? &gt;&gt; Can I show you something? &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Please. We're excited to see it. &gt;&gt; We want to see it. &gt;&gt; Guys, come on. Ah, show us. Show us. &gt;&gt; All of you make intelligent saves. &gt;&gt; That's what you wanted. &gt;&gt; Stone. &gt;&gt; Show us. &gt;&gt; 21. &gt;&gt; Perfect. &gt;&gt; Three. &gt;&gt; Perfect. &gt;&gt; Nine. &gt;&gt; Very perfect. Stone beard. You are aware this is some sort of vision. The three of you were not. Um, you are at this place. you're at whatever it must have looked like in the past. Uh you hear off in the distance uh explosions, some sort of battle. Uh and you do see uh elves uh running around um wearing these uh greenish silver uniforms like they would have looked at the time, look looking great. Uh running around giving commands. And you see a young stone beard. What did he look like during the war? Damn. He He He looked in spirit shockingly like Leonus. He was upbeat. He was chipper. You see him walking around. He's He's taller than his peers. And he goes, "Let's go, guys. We can win this fight. Come on. We just have to keep pushing ourselves in each other." Did your Stone Beard's balls not drop yet? &gt;&gt; What do you think Leonus is like? &gt;&gt; Moged. &gt;&gt; What? You three just feel like you're soldiers. Like, yeah. Yeah. All right. Yeah. Like, yeah, we're okay. &gt;&gt; Sir. Yeah. Stoneird, sir. &gt;&gt; Hey, Stone Bread. Wouldn't that be funny if his name was Stone Bread? Private Rome. &gt;&gt; So, we're back in the vision now. &gt;&gt; Wait, we're in We're &gt;&gt; in this and you three are not aware you're having a vision. You're just dudes that are here in the war. &gt;&gt; Okay, I get that. You are completely aware of the fact that this is a vision in a flashback. Yo, an elf from the water. 650 crew. What's up, dog? &gt;&gt; 650. &gt;&gt; I've seen you around. Let's go. &gt;&gt; Is it like is is it like the Is it your brain in there? &gt;&gt; No, no, no. It's mostly meat. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; You're gross. Don't follow me. &gt;&gt; Stone beard. &gt;&gt; I love your encouragement. &gt;&gt; Wait, you're like, wait, are these the same what they're agents? &gt;&gt; Yes, stonebred, sir. Are they the same people who have transported back or are they taking the role of soldiers in that era? &gt;&gt; I leave that up to you. If you're still a turtle, if you're a changeling, if you're still a sea elf, if you're another dude, it's just uh &gt;&gt; But I am still stone bear. &gt;&gt; You are a stone deer. &gt;&gt; Is this a real vision from the past? Like do you is this a memory or is this &gt;&gt; becoming aware? Yeah. I mean, you were deployed lots of places. It's just the fact that you just walked into a fortress for a briefing. It didn't mean anything. &gt;&gt; Didn't mean nothing. &gt;&gt; This is all happening. another Gith Yonke who served with you, who was a friend of yours, comes walking up, you tell me who it was, &gt;&gt; Elias. &gt;&gt; Um, Elias walks up to you and he goes, "Bro, uh, not too sure about these elves, man. Um, the intelligence that the Wildfire Brigade's bringing back, there can't be that many of them. There can't the the incursion, the demons. No army can have that many soldiers. &gt;&gt; What do you mean, Elias? [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Little bro, um, I promised our uncle I'd get you back. And if you're going to survive this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you got to toughen up a little bit, okay? You can't just be like, "Uh, I'm ready for battle." When you say that, you hear, "See, he's ready." And you will see an elven woman come walking up. She looks formidable. Um, her hair is back in a very elaborate braided ponytail. And she goes, "At ease, at he's at ease." &gt;&gt; This is still within the the vision, the the memory. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'm a dwarf named Jackson. &gt;&gt; Stone beard. Stone beard. Jackson, &gt;&gt; take a sip of this. &gt;&gt; Takes the edge off. &gt;&gt; Okay. Oh, what is it? &gt;&gt; Keep drinking that. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; You know, Elias looks at you and he's like, "Jackson, don't get him strung out on that shit." The next thing you know, he's going to need like six or seven planes a day to function. &gt;&gt; Elias, relax. This stuff's gross. &gt;&gt; It's like hits the wall, hits the ground. It's like little hiss. &gt;&gt; Helps me look you in the eyes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And you see uh she looks at you and she says, "I'm so glad that we are doing this joint operation with our brigade, your brigade. Uh my name is Coat Strega. I'm forward leader of the Wildfire Brigade. We've been told that today is the day that we are finally going to initiate Operation Anvil and Hammer." Stroga, what is anvil and hammer? &gt;&gt; She like, you don't you don't you saluted the ones. Like, it's you don't have to. &gt;&gt; Apologies, Stroga. No, you don't have Okay, wait. Listen, listen. Listen. Let's cut the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Let's cut the ranks. We're just all out here trying to fight. All right. We want to send those bastards back to wherever the hell they came from, literally, and get back to our lives. &gt;&gt; Okay. It's um Look, I I know Elias, he doesn't believe me. Our forward scouts, it's it's unmistakable. And she just holds her hands up and in front of you, you all see an illusion um form. And there is a canyon uh a canyon that none of you recognize. Even you being aware of the modern you, it doesn't look like anywhere in particular, but hundreds, thousands of demons are just pouring out of it like ants, like an almost unimaginable number of just that are flowing out. And she says, "If we don't plug this hole, there will be more of them. Not just more than every soldier that we've got, more than every man, woman, child, and censient in any of the kingdoms. Where is this? &gt;&gt; It is not far from here. And so there is a plan in place to uh bring the anvil and the hammer. &gt;&gt; She goes, "Ah, Jackson." &gt;&gt; I feel like you're not taking me seriously. &gt;&gt; No, I'm taking you so seriously right now. Like look at those guns. Like I mean like you're as wide as you are tall, bro. &gt;&gt; Jackson's cool, man. &gt;&gt; Although we established he's a dwarf named Jackson. Who are the two are you? &gt;&gt; Uh I'm just another toral. My name is Beeron &gt;&gt; and I've just no relation, &gt;&gt; but I you know you fight in the war. You're just a guy fighting in the war and I'm a private. &gt;&gt; Been to a couple tours but I'm a little bit on the lazy side. &gt;&gt; Hey, slow and steady wins the war, right? &gt;&gt; I'm a tortal. &gt;&gt; Uh I'm I'm an undead. &gt;&gt; So in this period in time, there wouldn't have been any. But you could be a living changeling. You could even really be Ran if you like. It's up to you &gt;&gt; when Ran was still alive. &gt;&gt; Oh, I like that. I'm I'm Ran but alive. &gt;&gt; Just because you guys knew each other literally a hundred years ago doesn't mean you ever put together that you might have actually met back then. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I leave that completely. &gt;&gt; You're in the army with so many people. &gt;&gt; I didn't know you were in the war. &gt;&gt; My my cigarette necklace is gone. I don't smoke tobacco. Uh I'm I'm I'm kind of like him. I have a a brighter view of life despite being uh from Mory and have a general &gt;&gt; chase a little rosier &gt;&gt; sort of. &gt;&gt; Can you make your skin change color? &gt;&gt; Yeah, man. No, don't do that. Don't do that. Uh turtle things still kind of weird me out. I don't see a lot of &gt;&gt; clop. I I will say as for why Ran doesn't talk about the war is completely up to you. Maybe he doesn't remember. Maybe he doesn't want to. Again, you did die and come back. Maybe that didn't come back with you. This is 100% up to you what that means. Uh, but Living Ran was here at at this time. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; My bad for interrupting. How we plug this hole. &gt;&gt; It's going to take more than just one badass dwarf. Jackson. Okay. Like &gt;&gt; Elias, what do you think we should do? &gt;&gt; He looks at you. He's like, we should listen to the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] briefing, man. What are you talking about? Like, look it down. &gt;&gt; What does the briefing say? &gt;&gt; No, she she's giving the briefing. just give the briefing right now. &gt;&gt; I just trust you. &gt;&gt; And he like leans in and he's like, when you're a commanding officer, you got to com you can't demand respect. You got to co-man respect. You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; Coleman. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Ah, that's just get hit in the back of the throat, isn't it? Yeah. He's like gives you a little fist in the chest. He's like, "We're going to make a man out of you. It's fine." you know, and she looks at you and she says, "There are unfortunately limits to what I can share with you, but we have been told, we have been promised that there is going to be a weapon deployed that is capable of stopping this flow of uh from the plane of asphodel. We also have been told they have a way that they can raise an unbeatable army. We can raise an unbeatable army. I don't know how, but Wildfire Brigade is going to go forward on the mission. Uh, you all are being deployed back south to hold the line in the Southern Theater. If everything they say is true, the war should be over in days. Meanwhile, while this is going on, I'm next to to human ran and I'm just explaining my whole family tree and it's taken 30 minutes and and so but my so my mom's sister on the the my dad's turtles to side, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; he had four other kids and I &gt;&gt; we can be we could be further apart from each other. I don't think this would it would influence what we're doing. I think it' be easier. So there were two of them and then they they would happen to be and so &gt;&gt; so as the vision is happening is it accurate like is the war over in a few days like I know what happens how does it deviate &gt;&gt; as you're watching this again you are starting to remember it that you were told this um I would say this probably was the beginning of Stone Beard's sort of uh slide into being disillusioned that they were told, "Whoa, the the war is going to be over and it wasn't." &gt;&gt; Are we still in the vision right now? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And we just got the plan. &gt;&gt; Mhm. That you all are being deployed south. The Wildfire Brigade was moving forward. &gt;&gt; So, who's part of the Wildfire Brigade? &gt;&gt; The elves. &gt;&gt; Just the elves. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; So, I have nine brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; Nine. &gt;&gt; I can name them all. &gt;&gt; I'm I usually have a pretty nice nice temper, but can you someone handle this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] guy? Minkx and Barricade come walking up. Uh, and again, both of them are wearing armor and they're they have bandeliers that are covered in knives and bows on their back. Uh, and they're like at ease, man. Like, you don't you don't when I mean there's no NCOs's out here, brother. Like, we're just all &gt;&gt; I got in trouble once and I &gt;&gt; I get it. I get it. Better better to overdo it. You Wait, let me do it then give it to you. Right. You ready? &gt;&gt; Yeah. I see them walk I see them walking over. &gt;&gt; Ran, you should finish this. &gt;&gt; Oh, no. I'm good, man. I'm good. I don't &gt;&gt; My parents for are smokers. I don't really dabble. &gt;&gt; Minkx is like, you know, we got some of the dankkest leaf out here on the frontier. Like it it's okay. All right. &gt;&gt; They look over at you and they're like, coette, um, we got to go. They say they say hammer and anvil's a go. And she's like, okay. Hey. Um, I know this was this was quick. We're going to go do our part out there. You guys do your part back there. We win. Right. &gt;&gt; We're excited to meet you on the other end. &gt;&gt; And she she looks at you. She's like, you I just never change. Okay. Don't don't don't listen to Elias. He you you ever been on on on a ship? You ever been sailing? &gt;&gt; I have. All the water in the world is not a problem unless you start letting it in. Man, &gt;&gt; just keep sailing. &gt;&gt; Not the water around you. It's the water that gets in you. &gt;&gt; It's weird when you say it like that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Operation Evelyn Hammer ready, sir. &gt;&gt; You see, she puts on a helmet and you see all of the elves get ready to mob and they're like, "Um, you guys head out. Uh, we're going to hold the line. We're going to push it forward." &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. And you off in the distance you hear the explosions get a little louder. She kind of looks and she goes, "Huh, seems little close for artillery. You all should probably uh go ahead and head out now just in case." &gt;&gt; Are you guys going to be all right? &gt;&gt; Yeah, we got each other. &gt;&gt; To my Elvin's brothers and sisters, fight. &gt;&gt; They all look at each other. Like &gt;&gt; I'm in the back saluting just cuz I like doing it a lot. I'm like, &gt;&gt; "Yeah, this time Barricade comes up to you and he goes, "Bro, you don't have to you don't have to try so hard." They um just just just be yourself. &gt;&gt; I mean, yeah. All right. I mean, I just I love I love this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; No, but look at you. You're like you're like 500 lb of just concrete. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know what I Like I mean you're not you're not a uh Jackson, but I mean who's Jackson? That guy &gt;&gt; is crazy. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I heard that dude squats 17 barrels. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I don't even know how they stack him. &gt;&gt; It was insane. 17 barrels full of hail. &gt;&gt; Uh and yes, &gt;&gt; Elias, I've been thinking maybe I stay behind. &gt;&gt; Elias, he's just like absolutely not. Wherever I go, you go. And wherever you go, I go. &gt;&gt; Well, I just feel like they could they could use us. It's we're needed in the south. We're going south. You you got to remember soldiers follow orders. Okay? Like there's always going to be a burning building, uh an invasion or whatever. Like there's always going to be the next person you can't save. If you can't think about that, it'll drive you crazy. You can only focus on the person you can save. &gt;&gt; Do we at this point know the the main bad guy of this war, the unspoken one? &gt;&gt; Yes. The Nobody knows like who the actual leader of the invasion is? Uh that's why they started just referring to it as the unspoken one. Uh but yes, you'd like this is the height of the war. &gt;&gt; I'm going to kill the unspoken one so we don't have to fight anymore. &gt;&gt; You You know what, kid? Yeah. Yeah, you might. But uh just today, how about you just watch my back? &gt;&gt; Okay. And the vision ends and you all are aware of what you saw. And now that you've seen it, you do remember that day. &gt;&gt; And she is still just sort of standing there casually with the but just sort of tapping the knife to her throat now. She's like, "You remember now?" Oh, &gt;&gt; so I'm guessing the war uh well went a lot longer than we thought it was going to and cost a lot more. &gt;&gt; What happened that day after we left? &gt;&gt; The problem is I could just tell you everything, but you're not going to believe me. What I need you to know, what I need all of you to know, this forging day, it's all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] The their peace, the pterodin, all of it's all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] We who stand at the crossroads remember what actually happened and what it actually cost. &gt;&gt; Well, how is it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] We know what it cost, but now we don't have to fight. You see, she stands up and she says and she just holds her hand up and the horde of zombies sort of parts a little bit and you see Jackson and Bon and you see Elias and Elias just has a hole punched through his head like half of his skull is gone and he's just standing there and she says, I spent the last hundred years finding all of my brothers and sisters and bringing them back the best that I can.
