 Oh my god, look at him. You look like Hel. You look like Hel. Do it again. Smile, dude. You [Music] all the microplastics. No, you'll just rise into the sky. That's it. But you'll live. But then they'll put it. They'll turn it off and we'll all get put back down. It's like it won't even be that big of a deal. Well, they'll threaten it. They'll say, "Pull out your phone. Threat me with a good time." They'll threaten you and they'll say, "Pull out your phone. Show me my crypto wallet." I just realized we've kind of done this bit already. What? You've done this Hasbro with magnets in our blood. No, it it was the vaccine, but the same It was the same bit about how the the magnets would would kill us cuz the cuz there's like lead in our blood or something. Yeah. No, but the the new the new tree, the dialogue tree is being risen up into the sky and then extorted for your crypto. Well, look look. Okay. Yes, but I'm saying I'm just saying like that's the yarn that I was pulling. It's surprisingly similar. It's surprisingly similar that we've also done like mega company put something in your blood that a magnet could be used to harm you with. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that was just also in X-Men 2. You know what I love every day about coming into this office? What's that? Is seeing my best friends and pretending that I work at Walmart. Because you come in and the building is just This is the kind of one the kind of episode you want to start. Well, this is What are you talking about? What are you talking about? Start anything. I love the fact that I walk in here and it's this like sort of blinding gray fluorescent heaven, I would call it. It's like a fluorescent heaven. Yeah. You can you can like look you can it's like a like a amphibious creature in the ocean. You can see through their skin to their blood and everyone's translucent. Everyone one guy's translucent. Everyone cuz you you show up. Oh, you I'm sorry. Really quick. Notice something. You see that in the corner? You see how it's whiter here and a little bit more tan right here? That's right, guys. I was in Hawaii and I'm still on island time. So, if you guys could just slow everything down cuz you like to live fast. You I think you are something. You're dead at 31. You're dead at 31. this year it just the hairline is is like a bad omen and it's just it's all coming together for you soon. Um unless of course you go to Hawaii like me and you repent for your LA lifestyle. That's what I did. Right. So you're saying that mahalo. All right. The fast and bustling LA lifestyle. You need to take a cool off and go to Hawaii instead. Right. Exactly. And yes, I had I had six pin coladas. Oh my god. In four days. Virgin virgin pina colada. Yeah, you should see me ordering it. When I go to the bar, I'm like, "Hey, can I get a virgin pina colada?" He's like, "Sorry, was that first thing?" I'm like, "Yeah, just like you do it however you want." Like for real, however you want. He's like, "Virgin." But first, virgin is such a funny word to have to use. I have like a ventriloquist like child and I'm like, "Can I get a virgin?" Oh no. What a good idea. It's for my dad. It's funny cuz you imagine you're like, "Can I get a non-alcoholic pin colada?" Guys, like virgin, say it. He's like, "Say it. Say it. Say it. I'm a bartender. I'm a bartender. I don't know what you're talking about. What? You're going have to say it." Wait, can you get a neat pinina colada? And it's just like they give you all the ingredients. Is that how neat works? I don't know what neat is. Well, neat just means just the liquor, no ice, no anything. Like, can I get a whiskey? Neat. They just pour it into a glass. Pinata. Neat. What would that be? That would be just not blended. Yeah. So, it's just the warm ingredients. Yeah. They give you like a pineapple. They give you like some ice. Yeah. No. No ice. No ice. Oh, I guess no ice cuz it's not free. Yeah. You just got to figure it out. Yeah. Virgin. Can I get my virgin pina, Nate, Aiden, I love I love having you back. Put it together for me. I love it. Got island time, man. It's just so much. You guys don't even don't even know the first thing about relaxing. Like, if you think you've been relaxed here. No, it's I can relax when he's gone. Try relaxing at a $4,000. You know what it's like to relax because he makes the space tense. He makes it tense. I make it tense. How? What makes it tense is the damn uh rays from heaven that are coming down from the ceiling. What makes it tense is is the goddamn I I wake up and I'm like, you've been asleep for 40 years. I'm like, oh my god. I feel like I'm in Mirror's Edge, dude. I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I knew it was over. I knew it was over. Remember the other day I was here and it was here in the morning a little bit early. So I'm waking up early and he it's that we have the lights off and then the vibe lights on. Yeah. And it's great. It's great. We've always loved it whenever he's gone. And then and then he just gets up from his desk, walks over to the overhead with everyone in the room with everyone in the room with the roll back Walmart lights where we can see all kinds of, you know, all kinds of merchandise and stuff like it's a warehouse. And he just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] slams it on. He's like, "It's just too dark." And I knew it was over. I know we're just We can't go back. It's dark. It's dark. It's the middle of the day. I don't want to sit in darkness. I got a question for you. I also do have to read. I got a question for you, Aiden. And understand, I'm asking it with much aloha. Yeah, he's has aloha. I want to be clear. I don't. But he's on your side. I'm not on your side ever. To be clear, I'm not on his side. He's not on your side. I'm actually his mortal enemy. But I but I actually created the war. I think the war there was never a choice before until he brought it. Give me a reason that is not spite that when you are 10 to one on this opinion. You need to repole it. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I need to repole it. Yeah. Who have you asked? H Kelby. Yingling. No. No. Keelby. Yling. Kelby flip-flopped. Yingling is a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] snake serpent venom. You did not just say Yingling. Yeah, Yingling. Did you just say Yingling? Yeah, he said Ying. Well, he he's just I think he's just talking about people who have showed him. If I showed him my DMs on this matter recently. Yes. That's because every time the lights are on, I get a DM from Nick, you're leaning on them. You're leaning on them with your corporate power. My corporate power. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's just say let's just say that the poll has shifted. Let's just say that. I'll give it to you. We all know you're losing the poll. The poll. Yes. The vote is not in your favor. Let's just I'll give that to you. But you know, the poll is not in your favor. We all can agree on that, right? Yeah. I think let's just We'll take it from there. But I want to be clear. We can only poll people who actively come into the office because I know some people who are like, "Yeah, the vibe lights are great." And there are people who come into this office once every 3 weeks. You cannot use [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Cam has an opinion on them. the whole camps aren't allowed to vote. We're hit we're going to hit him with a nuclear missile that not him. Um my question is especially when we before the repole when the poll was 10 to1 because at one point it was what is your reason for still taking what you want that is not spite. Okay. So non-spiteful is I think every single time I've turned this overhead light on when there is other people here this week. I think every single time has been a day where I've had to go through mail and read things at my desk that I need to follow up with at my computer, which I think is a totally appropriate reason to turn the overhead lights on because when they're not on, it is dark in here. But I ask I ask the the the follow question that everyone in the crowd wonders and in my Discord DMs, why not why not get yourself like a reading light and then your your problem solved and everyone else's problem is also still solved. He's about to say why do I have to buy a special light to replace the overhead the only one who wants it that way? So it goes from I'm also you're the only one who's happy and everyone else also I I would argue one of the only people working in this office and now we're pulling rank here it is despite despite he's pulling rank and activity and he said and and by the way Kelby does work when I watch him eat Chipotle Kelby Kelby is the one he might be losing I'm just saying when I watch him eat I'm happy to lose one especially him and he's in an Apex stream that's work so that's what you're supposed to be doing. The people whose opinion that matter are Christian right now until other people start coming in more often. Christian, Otto, Yigling, Kelby, me. Those are the five people at the moment who's going to vote. Crazy that he left out Dan, by the way, and Liza. Oh, and Liza. Liza hasn't been here. Well, we don't count the the female employee. Yeah, we don't count. We don't count our female employee, right? Dand because why would she have an opinion on the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] light in the last couple weeks? Cuz why would she have an opinion on it's like if it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bright in here doing your makeup at your desk, you need the light for your makeup probably. Dan's a gremlin. He would he would be in the darkness for the rest of his life. Okay. And now we're gremlin. Now we're judging the votes. Now we're gremlin shaming. Here we go. Let me guess. Your side should have free votes. Dan is like I would call him like the overhead lights on. Like probably not. So let me let me get this. Let me get this straight. Your side should have more votes. You think there should be a recount? Um, oh, also the people that voted for the other side are freaks. All very similar. There's a similarity similarity to a guy that would would have won this election if he was show. If you're sitting if you're sitt If you're sitting at home, if you're sitting at home listening to this, I want you to understand that the cozy light that they want on in the morning because the sun we only have one side of the building with windows and the sun doesn't come into that side of the windows in the morning. They got a gorgeous American flag for the first half of that for the first half of the day. So when the the cozy lights are these like lights you put on when you go to bed like you my dick and my balls. No. Yes they are. Dick and my balls. No. And I the guy who works at the office want the overhead lights so I don't sit in darkness and so I can read things at my desk. To which I allow the darkness maybe at all the time when I don't need to read things. You just have god tier cognitive dissonance in a way that I What is the cognitive dissonance? I need to do something that needs the lights on to be in a room. What is happening? To be in a room with so many people who are going like so many people who and me typing away happily. This is so annoying. This is so annoying. I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] livid. This isn't cognitive dissonance. How many of the people you're talking about are in the room right now? Literally none of them. It has been melting Kelby all week. It's me, Slimy Kelby. I have a question. I have a question. I have a question. If you didn't need to read mail. Yes. Which is what I already do. Yes. Which is what I already do. Why am Why am I being gaslit? Like, I didn't already let this I literally don't turn it on before I left. I do not turn it on when I don't need to read anything. I concede it. Now, do me a favor. Do me a favor. Imagine yourself on a Maui beach. L. You're laying down. Maui beach. Much brighter than that room. Maui beach. much brighter than that room. You enjoyed the sunlight. Sit back. Sit back. Imagine yourself on a Maui beach. Virgin pin colada in the right hand. Uh um and you're and you're and you're looking up into the sky and it's just hit sunset. 654. It's just hit sunset and I have the I have the time memorized already. Go. You can hear the birds on the beach. You come into the office to play Street Fighter. up walks up walks a Samoan woman or a Hawaiian woman even Hawaiian man. Hawaiian man walks not a woman Hawaiian started freaking out. He would have been like got these lights on. Um okay. Hawaiian woman walks up and she says, "Sir, are you enjoying your stay here at the Maui Resort?" And you don't you won't even answer. She already knows the the answer to the question is yes. Of course I am. Um and and in comes what's this? A gaming setup. Oh, it's wielded. It's It's No, it's dropped from heaven. A gaming setup falls down from heaven right in front of you. And honestly, sunset, you're like, "It's getting a little dark out here." You clap your hands. Boom. It's sunlight again. It's back to being 100 p.m. Pink to Denmark. Perfectly bright outside and and you're playing Counter Strike now on the Maui beach and you're perfectly relaxed. Now, Aiden, with all your newfound aloha and mahalo and all the such inside of you, so annoyed. Has any of your opinion changed? Do you feel better? I feel I feel better. What do you feel? Taking that journey, that mental journey cuz you really went somewhere there just now. I saw it. I It's been 30 minutes of you being asleep. 30 minutes. You were just staring at the ceiling, bro. If you realize that you were waiting, you drooled onto your paint. We had to cut it. I can't believe this. I was just You were just there for me. Droo had to pat dry you clean. They'd love that. They would love that if that was iPad, right? E, why would they like that? Our [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ass fans would [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that. You know what I've been doing in this office all week when I play Counterstrike? Those lights are off when I play Counter-Strike. You know, I was going to ask that. I was going to ask if when Counterstrike is on, the lights turn off. And that's kind of a cool way to indicate that we're not in a meeting right now. That we're we're playing. We're playing. We're playing. And I think that'd be kind of fun. But you do that already. No, you don't get up and change it. You just do it once and then I'm going to do a gym from the officeesque prank where I I bring in one extra light every day. Oh my god. Until he doesn't notice. We take out a bulb from the fluorescents every day. Here slowly. This is viewers at home and one day if you happen to be watching this episode, if you happen to be watching this episode, you might be looking at the set right now. These lovely soft yellow lights that indicate that it's evening time. You know, perhaps we're sitting in the backyard. Well, that was big and yellow. It wouldn't wouldn't the main soft yellow light that's you know the main lighting for for us I would say unless you lean back and look straight up at that white one. So you might be looking at these lights and this like cozier vibe and say oh that's really nice and it is cuz that's the vibe of the lights in the other room and you know doesn't think this is good for hangouts good for chilling good for for sipping a couple brews with your friends out back. We're not working in here. And I want to ask you, you know, like how do you, you know, if you were in the middle of the day in an otherwise dark room and you needed to read and and write stuff at your computer, he actually, you realize, if you really break it down by dollar, if you really break it down by dollar amount, he actually makes less money in the bright room job than in the cozy room job. It's tough because does Lemonade stand have the same evil, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up, Israeli homophobic life? No, that it looks like a goddamn gas station in that room. It's crazy in that room. I don't know how they I don't know how I don't know how Atriarch does it because he's got a stim [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] STEM lord Doug. I love code. I love math more than I love women. Chat GBT, could you make these lights more brighter chatbt? Could you I actually just learned AI could be used to turn on your lights in your house, which is it takes 30 more minutes, but I like talking to it to do that. Um Oh, he's on his phone now. Now he's on his He's doing work. He's doing work. I know he's he's putting up some sort of poll and it's going to be once again propaganda. Propaganda, of course, because it's coming once again propaganda. It's coming from the the the the mouth of the horse. The mouth of the horse says many awful things. From the butt of the guy it's coming from. Yeah. I think that what's cool about working at a Walmart is I I know that in here the prices are cool about working if comes in steal something, just let him go. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you. You would work. You would work. You come in to play Street Fighter. You come in to play Street Fighter. Street Fighter is harder than any job. That's true. To strengthen your argument. To strengthen your argument. You said, "I don't turn on the AC," which I literally do every day. It's really late to do it. I literally do it every day. He only does it when it starts to sweat. He does it when he notices it's warm. That's what I'm saying. Very awittian moment to you. It's just, oh, I've noticed it. I will change it. When I Sorry. When I come in the morning and it's cold in the building, I don't turn it on yet. 1500 MR Street Fighter is harder than your job. And that's on God. Sorry, I'm on a call. Sorry. What do you say? Sorry. Hawaii called. They want me to come back and live there forever. They want you to stay. They want you to come back. They want you to get take your shirt off and tan the rest of your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] body. Oh, now we're getting personal. Now we're getting I didn't know. I like that. No, this is this is how this is how the right fights their fight. And and as and as a as a new as a new found guy who lives with Aloha. I'm not going to even stoop to that level. I'm just going to say mahalo and and yeah like man I wish you the best because those people Aiden those people they know how to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] excuse my language live and and you you're just so tense. It's it's like it's like your toes haven't been in the sand for how God knows how long. That's what I'm saying. Dead at 31. Dead at 31. Yeah. And it's it doesn't you know it's for a guy who fears death so much. What are you doing on your phone? I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] What's this? Like how long it would take like my dad to do what he's doing. Except Yeah. I'm expecting a to start holding it like this. Like you got the GL. Hold on. The glasses. Now kiddo. Uh kiddo, which one is the app? How do you get the little smiley faces? Which one's my app and which one's my phone? Dude, that is actually such a dad question. Oh my god. I'm quitting this quitting. I'm quitting this show. I'm quitting the dog show and I'm joining the Other Yard podcast. The other yard podcast. The prison one. The yard. The prison one. I'm going to go ask him. I'm going to say, "Hey, I'll bring you all the brand and success and passwords. You can have it. As long as I can join your prison yard podcast." You know why he wants to join that one? Same lighting. That one's the sun. That was the sun. Yeah, I know. You know what? And it's the same. Wait, guy guy who just said Hawaii is the same lighting. All of a sudden in his scenario, the sun's different lighting. Hold on. Hold on. I want to be clear. If the if I could have the sun the sun light the room, if we had a skylight, if we had an actual amount of sun coming into this room and it wouldn't be dark because of that, I would be happy with that. That would be great. I think it's bad for like maybe our circadian rhythm to just always be terrible. That's the problem. I don't want to spend all day in a dark room when it's sunny outside. All day in a dark room when it's sunny outside and sit sit in dark lighting inside as it's as it's bright and sunny outside. It sounds like you should have been a marine biologist instead of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] COO of a of a pedophile influencer company. Like that's your that's your fault that you were not a park ranger and instead you work for a child molester in one week. Yeah. One week the child. Say say it out loud and then we'll ship it we'll ship it to Kelby and be like guys you probably shouldn't say that he's a child molester because because that's bad for brands and like why Kelby obviously I know it's the dogs all over again dude it's like I'm I'm like being asked to stay in a dark room all day in the place that I mainly work in that like that's that's what he's acting like he's in the hole in Guantanamo Bay this isn't you're about Matilda. Bro, you're Miss Trunch Bowl. Kill yourself. To which to which I've also accommodated entirely until I have to do something that I need the overlights on for over. Let me ask you a question. Do you feel underappreciated here? Underappreciated by you two? No. No. Just in general? No. Oh, I feel fine. Awesome. I feel fine about about my work and my job to work in the job that you two don't work at. to the company that you don't work here. Cammy is harder than any job anyone here does. That's not a job. But if it was, if I was getting paid for that, it'd be harder than anything else. Sure. Thank you. Hey, this is the yard's place of business, too. I work on the yard here. And if I could join the Real Yard podcast and talk about prison stories. God, so fun. You know what? A year in prison do you well? Oh my god, you need some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] appreciation. You love it for some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You know what? They have [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] some nice bright lights. I know. Yeah. They got bright lights. They got And then you know when it's bedtime, they turn the lights off. Light gets dark when it's bedtime. Like clockwork every time. Well, no one wants the lights off. That would be It' be crazy that the lights off while we work. It would be insane. What do you mean? It's more of a vibe either way. The sunlight is I mean catching a vibe is catching a vibe not a job. I guess I guess for podcasters it is. I guess we have to Okay. Well, I see how you roll. Um, I got a little something that happened to me in Hawaii. I think it's pretty cool. It's a little bit of a had to be there story, but I think it's worth telling. A had to be there story a little bit. Um, so well, but like we did last time, let's pretend we're there. Yeah. So, I'm on the beach at nighttime, Aiden. Sorry. Do I get a PC with Counter Strike in this version? Very dark being lit only by stars. Beautiful, but I will say hard to read mail probably. Um, similar to the light. You wanted Maybe you wanted to read mail on the Maui Beach. Um, and I'm looking up at the sky and you can see all the stars cuz there's no LA smog or or light pollution or any of that garbage that we have out here in LA. You can see every star in the whole night sky. And we've been watching the sky maybe for like maybe like an hour and a half or something and maybe two hours. And uh I look over my beautiful girlfriend just laying there and the stars are gleaming off her eyes and I say, "You know, I've never seen a shooting star." And she's like, "Really?" And the second she says really, a shooting star flies across the sky. First time ever seeing one. And we're like, it's when I said it. It's like a Disney movie. And I had a moment where I realized that all the things that I've done, assuming God is not watching, he has been watching. And now I'm like, uhoh. That was my first thought. Now you believe in God. My first thought was like, uhoh. All the things I thought God didn't see. That's all it takes. I actually cannot wait until you hit 30 and you start watching like Rome documentaries. It It's It is a unavoidable path in your life. I feel like I hit this way like the amount of like 45 minute long science videos I've been watching since like 24. Okay. Just like daily. I feel like I'm already there. Just not history. There's a history. science when we turn 30 in this in our pocket of existence of like you know first world country whatever you want to call it like you start to the you start to think about the past and it just coincides with history YouTube and you will get taken like Alex's phase was very short but he still had it what's new man that guy having a short phase I mean short phase what is this lacy he see that's what [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Here's the thing. Aiden. Aiden. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] My [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lovely friend that I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] love. I don't like that you made fun of my streamer cuz he's he's under a lot of stress right now because of the view body. He is. Him and X are beefing. And Jakura. He's under a lot of stress from that, too. His best [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] friend just got broken up with. Best [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] friend is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] really love to them, man. Love out love to you guys. Stop doing that. Stop. No, it was it was low enough. Stop doing it. The fingers are very low. Just keep it down. No. No. I'm turning it into a reach. It's like turning it into a reach. Like I'm shooting. You raised it. You raised it. No, I didn't raise it. Stop doing it. Stop doing it. Doesn't matter. You're being I'm going to use my elbow. It would have to be more up here. It would be way more up here. It's like That's like how you made fun of that kid in school. It's right here. It's like to the to my people. Stop doing it. The fingers are very open. That was open that time. He was kind of like open the first time. Anyway, uh what was I even saying? I was gonna say even if my fingers look going down here. Even if my fingers were closed like and I'm gonna put my my palm up like this. That was low enough. See, now it feels like a dog whistle. No is like, "Hey, come here. Come here. Treat." When Aiden dog whistles, he has a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 9 millimeter. His other hand, come here, bud. Come here. Get over here. I was gonna say, bro, yeah, you Yeah, we get a little [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] riled up on this pod. We [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] push your buttons because it is funny that you like overhead lights compared to other lights. It's just funny and it's Yeah, it's a bit of a slice of your character and it's funny to talk about. But I also treat it like a game. Like can I can I present it in any way that doesn't make him mad that doesn't get him really mad? No. And let me tell you something. Let me let me [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tell you something on [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on cringe ass [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stupid stupid ass lemonade saying. Do they ever [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] reveal the truth to you like this? Of course. Of course they do. They torture you. They [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with you. They don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with you. They don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with you. I don't believe they respect you on there. Oh god. They respect the hell out of you, I should say. They don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with me. Yeah, they don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with you. They might They might light jab. They might be like, "Oh, Aiden Aiden probably likes Putin." And they all go, "Oh, that's a pretty good one, huh? Coffee cow." And then they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] make out for 10 minutes to farts a little bit. This is startlingly close to something that happened a week ago. So that sucks, brother. Man, they did. But you're the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] heart and soul of that podcast. And when you come on here, we make you stronger. I'm 10% less funny now, dude. Yeah. Did you hear that? Doug Doug Doug paid a Fiverr uh wizard magician to cast a hex on Aiden, and he got it and they sent a they sent a video back and it's this guy. He's like in a he's in like a dark room. It looks like a tent and he's like around a fire chanting and it's the curse that he put on me to make me 10% less funny on the yard. I think I've noticed it this episode. No, I was going to say in all seriousness cuz our our last episode is like brigaded with lemonade heads. These pedophile fans. Oh my god. You can smell them from here. And they're like, "Oh, 10% less funny it feels like." And I asked and I was like, "What is this?" And he explained it. And I got to say, it's only been a half hour today. It hasn't changed a bit. You're not even a 1% less funny. In fact, I call you more funny because you're being genuine and I appreciate you. What is this? And I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like you, man. I see you really putting the work in today. You know, that's a gold star. That's what I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] saying. That's a gold star. I didn't know. I know. You didn't even know I was handing him out today cuz you didn't check. You didn't check. I get the gold star. He gets the gold star for complimenting me. No, he gets the gold star for complimenting me. You nothing to host the gold star. He gets the gold star. I thought you were giving him a gold star. I get a gold star. You get the gold star. That was a That was a lovely comment to your friend. I mean it. You're really putting the work in with him. Yeah, 100%. And he needs it, man. I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mean that. It's just at home. It's just like the whole thing. He's got a father thing going on and he just can't focus. It's not really his fault. Yeah. Yeah. Bad home life. Yeah. Bad home life. But God, he lives in a weak foundation. The kid can see the numbers. Really? He's gifted. Kid's talented. We're going to take him to Vegas. Yeah. Rubik's Cube. He learn He learned a Rubik's cube by four. You know that? And that's what I'm saying. You go to the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cringe ass lemonade stand, they're not going to put your feet to the fire. the it was it was so illustrative of when that one clip that I saw where he was like, "Yeah, I was talking to my Uber driver and then he starts cowering like he's about to get hit in the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] head and then the the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] chuckle [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are like that's fine. Yeah, I don't know. We do that." I like how Doug is joining the chuckle [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] He has to be. I mean, he's not. This is having cascading effects. I realize that the that you're either a chuckle [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] or a bad boy. Those are the two types. Yeah. And you know what on that pod? You're a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bad boy. Me? You're the bad boy lemonade stand, dude. He is. Let's go. Yeah, dude. You're in a chuckle [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Oreo, bro. And you're the cream filling. Cream filling the bad boy Oreo. Chuckle [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Oreo [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what you guys do to me on this show is I mean it's it's it's reaching further. I've realized cuz I I made an Instagram post for the first time in almost like 3 years and I I made the post just a nice picture of me in Sweden. Every single comment is about how how am I happy that I returned to my white paradise or like the ethnosate and and I'm reading through all the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] comments and I realized that if you are anyone that follows me from like high school or college, it looks really bad. Yeah. Yeah. Well, to be fair, that's what we did to Super TF all week. He's been streaming and I think he needs to like bring his brother on stream to like stop the accusations cuz last week we kept asking if his brother was homeless and he kept saying no he's not but kind of like kind of incredulous about it. Indignant I should say. We should hire we should hire uh Super's brother to come fix our HVAC in here and and not tell him this is well he would he wouldn't know what technology is. Um so we would wouldn't tell him this is a show or anything and we could just sit here and interview him while he works on it. when you So, where are you from? Hey, man. So, how is like where you live right now? He's like, "Oh, Philly." No, like in a house location. No. No. Well, I mean I mean No. No. I don't have a house. It's hard to get a house. House. Oh, so you're renting them in an apartment. I mean, do you guys got a compressor? You know the compressor is? No. What's a compressor? Yeah. Okay. Never mind. I'll just keep working on this one. Okay. Oh, right. Yeah. Okay. Your brother though. Your brother's got money. He probably helps you out. Yeah. I mean, he's god money. He's god money. But I again, I just got to get working on this cuz I got a couple jobs. You guys seem cool and all. Super. Man, he's just sweating. That kid is a That kid's a treat. You like Super. Yeah, I like, you know, he's really nervous about being on the show. I saw that. He's crazy. I love You know I like something I never expect to happen but almost always happens is like I get served a clip on my homepage that's like blank talks about being on the yard and it's always the guest we just had and it's them on their stream and they're like yeah guys I was nervous man I was nervous to be on the yard and they do the same they all do the same but it ended up being chill it was a vibe I think it was good I think it was good vibe they all have the same recap yes they just had a really nice like adapt I think forgot what the yard is no he did it he did the same thing. Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah. Oh my god. I can't stop thinking about it. At the streamer games, I passed by him. He put out his hand a fist bump and I didn't see it and I walked by him. Was it on stream? No. And I walked by him and then I was like, "Oh god." Cuz Adapt already I think doesn't really know how to engage with me cuz I don't know how to engage with him and it's just it's just an awkward festival. Yeah. Me and him are blood linked. You guys are blood linked. But like for me it's like, "Oh, that was the guy that was on the show or whatever." It's like that's Lwig's friend or whatever. Dude, you should have seen me. I hit the cleanest no look dab with him cuz he was on stream. He walks up. He's like, "What's up, Nick?" I'm like, "Yeah, what's up?" Oh, so you're not supposed to look. No, it's just a swag thing to do. I just looked away. I was like, "Oh, I thought he was being and cuz we were we were kind of passing." So in my head I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, me and you. We're both working. We're both doing our thing." And I'm literally here just to drink Red Bull aloha mode before you went. I was pre-loaing. I was prejacking my aloha, right? And then I I hit the He's drinking his Virgin Red Bull. I felt like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] And I know he doesn't care, but I'm like, I don't want this guy to think I think he's cringe or some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Well, next time you see him, dude, you got to go for a DAP. Well, what I tried to do was I tried to DM him on Twitter and be like, "Yo, bro, I didn't mean to leave you hanging." I can't I can't cuz he's Oh, thank God. Yeah, I would. Thank god you didn't send that cuz he doesn't follow me. Me and you were in the same boat. I think your phone would have exploded. I think there's nothing there's no shame in being like, "Yo, I didn't mean to leave you hanging." I I can reconcile that he doesn't know my name. That's fine. That's fine, too. But he put out his hand to fist bump me and I didn't. And you left him hanging. And I didn't do that. You You fist bumped I hit the daff with the daft every time. And does he not know my name when he does it? Yeah. But that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fine, bro. And does he say hey with that awkward falloff where you can tell he doesn't remember your name? Doesn't remember him. and doesn't want to keep talking and doesn't want to keep talking. He doesn't really want to think about how he doesn't know you're right. Doesn't make me feel so awesome cuz he always says, "What's up, Nick?" Yeah, cuz you were so late. You [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] trickshotted him. Like that's Yeah, he sired to me like a vampire. The one who turned him to live with that. That's right. We have We haven't done anything of that nature. No. So, you went to White Paradise. You went to gentrified white paradise. Yeah. Go. Maui is and and God bless the people of Maui because they went through that fire. But uh it's a it's tourist hell. I'm going to be real with you guys. Like I've been I've now been to at the ABC Maui and I've been to Kai and Kai was awesome. It was just beautiful and quiet and whatever. Maui was just like everything was expensive and it was all white Californians and and and like we like went to like a restaurant and it was like a line down the block like everything was it was not slow. It was like everyone was like I saw people fighting on the beach like like like a wife and a husband just screaming at each other and I'm just like what the hell's going on? It's still gorgeous but no one was on island I was I think I'm the only one on island time there. You went for island time. I went for island time. He and there was no white white California man seeking his island time. You can't even get it. And meanwhile, it's like every Valve employee on their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] seventh vacation of the year on the beach in Hawaii. You know, Alaska's closer to Hawaii than California. That makes sense to me. Isn't that crazy? Alaska's almost touching Russia, bro. Oh, because people don't realize that like Hawaii like goes way further up. Yeah. So like technically like the tip of Hawaii is like really like much closer to Alaska. I did not know that. When I was in Hawaii with Josh, uh, he got on Slippy Wi-Fi and played his puff against people. Jesus. And it was really crazy. Yeah. In the hotel Wi-Fi. I played Slippy on my laptop on a plane right once and my in-game was on plane RN. Yeah. I had like 700 ping. You shouldn't do that. You shouldn't do that. Just know just to see. It's kind of funny. The ping is so bad that you're like and you see the name and you're like, "Okay." So I believe you're intrigued enough to give it a go. What's this like? It's just like a sl it's complete slideshow. Like you get one input per five seconds. Yeah. And that's the fun of it. You've accepted RTS, dude. You know the the when I'm here hanging out playing Street Fighter, which is my job. I'll uh people will quit out on me. It's it like morning to afternoon Street Fighter is really interesting people. They only have so much time on their break, man. Yeah. Right. I got another one. or or they're like really unemployed but they're then they're like not happy. I don't know something's wrong but like from 9:00 a.m. to noon Street Fighter online master rank is very funny. So like about every 45 minutes I'll jump out of my chair and pop off because someone has quit out on me and then everyone else is in a meeting. Yeah, you laugh like Warriio every once in a while. It's so fun. Oh my god. It'll just come out of the blue cuz you only drop it like once every couple days and it just pierces. It should you should have to wear it on your profile if you quit out. Yeah, you should. You should have like your like your every character should have an in-game penis size and you lose inches if you quit. Dude, you fight a a Ryu with like a micro. Yeah. And you're like, you're filter. So funny. You can bond this in. If you got naked Cammy in that one dude's game, it was Chun Lee, by the way. Cammy players are not gooners. You fight before a super hungry and you're like, "Oh god, this guy's going to be good." Even Even Zipper had to step in. Yeah, Zipper did groan at that. Well, how was the how was the episode without me? Did it feel like there was just a gaping hole? Like, was there a gape in the podcast? Well, we had a lot to talk about because once again, 2v1 clown the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of Aiden, which is really awesome. Oh god. Just tag teaming because Lewig Lewig actually pulled it twice. He moved the podcast twice. Actually, he moved it twice, but then you cancelled on that day and both times I had driven here earlier. I felt so bad and I was like, "Dude, I drove here again." Well, the difference between me and Love is I felt bad. You did feel bad and you said sorry three times. Said Yeah, but I had to tell him to do it. So, when you said say sorry, I'm like I was literally like this sipping a pan of colada. I was like, couldn't be me. All that all that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stress over there. Uh-uh. He did. To his credit, he responded pretty quickly and he said, "I'm sorry." And he meant it. Why did I want to go back and try to eat a hot dog fast again? Dude, great question. Oh my god. He says he's like, I really I I was going to show you on the show, but I got my time down to 16 seconds. That's such a big improvement. What did he do? I don't know. He's been grinding. He did something. He found out the meta, but I think I can still beat him cuz I'm a real eater. Yeah. So So I need to find out what his meta was and then we need to face off. You just need He's gotten four, five opportunities. He's watching YouTube videos. Yes. I haven't been really studying. I was just a naturally talented player that's going to get out practiced, but unless I practice, but you can put in a little practice. He He is eating a shitload of hot dogs. That's the biggest problem right now for Lewig's life. Why is he eating so many hot dogs? He's practicing to eat fast. You know what I think he's doing? I think he's practicing to be at a Dodgers game and eat one in front of Show to impress him. It's probably something like that. Yep. You know what I goes back to Japan with that guy? He he likes having his Vespa so bad or his bike because he can go to Dodgers games way easier. I believe that is one of the reasons. I think so. How often does he go? He doesn't even go that much. I think every other every couple weeks he goes, but like so Lwig I I thought about this in the car. He is so allergic to his time being taken up by things like traffic or like travel or whatever. And that's why he's such an [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] when he like tries to make it just in time or like cram all this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Yeah. Because he he gets [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he freaks out if he's in traffic. And I think it's childish and I think he should be put down and put in prison. Either one. I don't care. Put down or or either or or maybe put sent to prison and then killed in prison unrelated to him by the Aryan Brotherhood. Okay. I think we should start sending criminals to Hawaii for just to like one week they don't need prison. I think they come back and they're reformed. They're like, "Go." We do that with homeless people sometimes. They're not I mean, they're not criminal, but we like send homeless people to Hawaii. I don't know if we do that. Homeless people to Hawaii. It's a goddamn awesome flight that they get. I might be just making this up. George Carlin had this old bit where he said, "We take [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] four states in the in like the Mountain West." He's like, "A Kansas, Nebraska, we we box them off and that's prison world." Yeah. Yeah. And you just get flown into prison world and that's it. And and the networks all fight over the footage. Oh my god. Yeah, that we'll definitely talk about. He's like, "This is how we monetize. This is how we pay for this." Oh god, he's so smart. He was a genius. This was like the '8s. God damn, he was smart. So so ahead of the curve. So how was Sweden, bro? Do you don't got any [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stories with you and your awesome cool girlfriend who's way cooler than you? Stories for for you. I want to hear some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stories, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Uh, nothing on there for you. You picking out your phone for some stories. You know what I have? White guy in a kimono. That's one of my notes and it's from EVO cuz that's what I saw. And I You saw white guy. Was it a cosplay? No. It was funny. Did I say this? I went to EVO and I had to get my badge, but I forgot it. So, it was like this whole process of like talking to people who don't know what EVO is. This is working an event. They're like, "Uh, yeah. I don't know. You got to go talk to go go down." It was this older lady. She's like, "So, you're going to go down all the way to the help desk and there's a young man in a ponytail and he's wearing like a Japanese and I'm like, Lwick's here." And in my head, I'm like, "Please be a white guy. Oh my god, I Please be a white guy." And sure enough, I walk down to the help desk and it's like an EVO guy who knows who knows what melty blood is. Moshi Mo. Yeah, dude. And uh and he helped me out and it was great. And I'm like in my head I'm like, "You can't be doing this." Did you bow? I I had to. Yeah. I'm going to show him respect. A samurai. Of course I do. It's a samurai. Oh, every white guy should have to do a day in a kimono in public one day. Yeah. It should be like your required service, bro. That's what they want, bro. Who's they? The white guys. The white guys in kimonos. They want to be able to walk to 7-Eleven and be like, "Kamicha. You're all you're all out of Charleston Chew. What's the whitest candy? Abazaba. That No, I think What is it? Abazaba. You don't know Abazaba? It's got like the black and yellow checkerboard candy. It's like It's like white taffy. It's not the whitest candy cuz it's taffy with peanut butter. Cuz in half baked in half baked Dave Chappelle says, "Aba, you're my only friend." And then eats it. This is such a cool candy, man. Look how [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up it is. I've never seen this. my older brother's favorite candy growing up. So, it was always just in my house and every time I'd be like, "Wow, the packaging looks so cool. I want to bite it." And then I'd bite it and be like, "Why did we make that?" That was the difference. I like Dabisava, dude. It's peanut butter inside of taffy. This looks weird. It's not bad. It's just weird. You know what was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up? Fast break. Can you look up fast break? Oh, is that the It's a Reese's and Nougat. Dude, these were these were so funny. They they actually changed the formula, but they were basically like 700 calorie [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] get get fat bars. Yeah, I love these. Oh man, we're getting we're getting on candy vibes. You guys uh Dude, we should have done a candy tier list for the Lwig is gone episode, bro. Oh, all candy. God damn. I mean, we easily could transition into that right now. It's already built, guys. Well, well, but it's halfway through the episode. Is that bad? Who gives a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Who [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cares, man? Love doesn't want to do a candy tier list. You just want to do the candy tier list. Wait, is it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up to do the candy tier list and not have the candy? I think so. Taste it or try it? We should probably order every candy and then we just have to come up with and then we feel [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] terrible after. Is it a Lwig list like cash in episode? He would love that. What if we did the fat guy like that? That fat gangster like you love doing that. What if we did a candy tier list with blood? Cuz he's not going to watch this. And and every time like we like we talk about the candy and every time he has an opinion, we're like, "Nah, not really. We just never understand what he's saying or agree with him or like you're like, "Nah, no, not really." He's like, "This is an A." I'm like, "More of a D." If you did that, he would eventually get pissy, but he would be silently fuming pissy. And then we all like what? We've been agreeing with you most the time. Yeah. Just gaslight him. Oh, that'd be so awesome. God, I love Candy and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with Lewig. Do you think he'll even come back? How long is he there for, bro? Probably forever. He has to come back because his awesome wife is here. Yeah, crash that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] car, man. Uh, dude, if he explodes in a fireball, it' be so cringe. It's in October. So, this is just another training period. This is one more training session. God damn. They gave him one piece Legos. Did you see? [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he going to do with that? Eat him. Eat him. He's like, "Oh, Luffy, maybe it's the only way to make him touch anything and appreciate it is just make it one piece." What was your I think you That's not That's not an exaggeration. I'm still on this a little bit, but what was your guys I went to I went to a candy store in Hawaii cuz I saw one. I was like, "Let's go in there." Um, and there was some rare candy in there.

And we bought them and tro trot them. And it was they were not as good as I remember. And I was going to ask, "What is your guys' little niche little candy from your childhood that that you feel like maybe no one else was eating, but you, a real eater, was eating?"

Am I in Am I in any candy? Okay. What was your favorite? Razles were a very techy candy because they would start off as these chalky little chews, but they would end up being gum. Yes. Oh, I've seen these. First it's candy, then it's gum and gum is not candy. Gum is not candy cuz gum is gum. Okay, that sounds fun.

You did not describe it. He does love these places and that's why. What do I serve to lose by agreeing acceptable places? What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do I care? What do I care? And so, so cuz often times they make good food, but I'm there and uh and I'm like, "Okay, I got to go to the bathroom." And I stagger around to the bathroom. And when I'm in places like this, I kind of try to like play up like that. I'm like a I'm not one of them. Yeah. That I'll like I'll like Oh my god. Yeah. So, but I go in the bathroom and there's this really great song playing and I didn't want to Shazam it cuz I didn't want to give the restaurant that. Alone in the bathroom. Yeah. This is how my mind works. And also, he's he's too shy to Shazam a song in privacy. I wasn't shy. I didn't want to get the to give the restaurant one over me. This is You should have to tell your waiter that. I should have. I promise. She was very sweet. Wait, I want you to know that I enjoyed the song you played in the bathroom, but I refused to shoot. Don't tell me what it's called. She She's just like, "Yeah, that happens a lot. Happens a lot." He also um the the the table next to us. Uh they left and he was like, "I'm going to eat their I'm going to eat that food off. I'm going to eat the food off that they left." No, here's what happened. I Dude, we were How could it be that much different from that? Listen. So, so we we ordered deileled eggs and they brought us [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] four deled eggs, which is literally two eggs. Yeah. Right. Because they got cut in half. They do get cut in half and that's more yield. Yeah. So, like the pickle. And we were like, "Oh, these are pretty good devild eggs." There is a a table of three women next to us and they're not peckish at all. Peckish means you're hungry, right? Oh, they're not hungry. No. Does it peckish? Peckish means you're like hungry but not that hungry. That's okay. They're peckish. Okay. They're like they ordered the devil eggs, too. They're not really touching them. So, so I get back and I and I kind of scoped this out because I'm like I mean, you know, what are we going to do? And so, so they're like about to leave and I'm dude I'm sitting across from Nick and I look up at him and I'm just like, dude, I got a serious plan right now. And he looks at me, instantly realizes what I'm about to do, and says, "Don't." Which was crazy. I just knew what he wanted. And I was like, "How did you know?" He's like, "Dude, I've known you for like 8 years. Like, this is not I said I said, "I've spent every week with you for 8 years. I know what you want. You want to eat the food off the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] table." And then And then I'm like, "Well, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's crazy, but that doesn't change anything about what I'm going to do." And then and then he reaches over. Oh my god. He gets about this close. Let's say this is the food. He gets about this close and he goes, "Oh, they took a bite. He he reels back cuz it wasn't actually I thought it was an untouched devild egg." So he goes, "Oh, they actually" And then the waiter shows up right as he does it and sees him reaching for the food. It was the buser. The buser cleared the table and he saw me basically like snap like like one of these and I just have my head in my hands. I mean, like it's like you you got caught and didn't get any. Did you wor Ontario? Thank god we went to that stupid [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] restaurant and I showed them what a real eater looks like almost. Did you walk in? You told them you're a real eater. Get ready. There's a real eater here. That's the place that has a really good that I am. I've talked about this before, but I am a little pretentious about my coffee and they have a really good almond milk latte. So, don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] around, man. Hey, highly likely in Highland Park, bro. H. It's so lame. It's not lame. It's fine. Is it cheoogy for him? Is it cheygi? Oh, it's cheoogy as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] They have an outdoor tiki bar. Kill yourself. It's not cheoogy. That's not cheoogy. Is that not? I'll let the I'll let the audience handle this. This place is a tier above like like they would they would know to not put like live, laugh, love on the wall. Like that's cheoogy. They don't have live, laugh, love, but it's like live, laugh, love [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bones in DNA. No, no, no. Che is a very It's like a very high bar. How do you say that? It's like a severe accusation. Yes, it's a it's a severe accusation. I would call it like LA trend core. Tik Tok core. That's pretty bad. This is like a Tik Tocky type of place. Is that is Tik Tocky? You got to go LA Oasis in Highland Park. They have the best breakfast burrito that's $45. Like that. It's a different kind of thing. I I I'm I'll I'll I'll insult it. I'm not above insulting it, but Chooi's like Cheoo's like It's the wrong word you're saying. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Whatever, man. This goddamn cheooy lifestyle I'm on. I can't leave it behind, man. Dude, it's so hot. My AC I'm not living right. My AC doesn't work. Dude, I was in my house and I was like, "Fuck, I'm sweating. I should turn the AC on." I look, it's already been on all day at 69. It's bad. And I'm like, why is my house hot? The the the AC cannot outrun the sun right now. It's so And and I was saying it hard enough. I know a little place where the where the weather's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] perfect, right? Yeah. Mhm. A little a little niche spot. You know the apostrophe is a consonant in the Hawaiian language. That's awesome. And the only reason I know that is because we played Jackbox in our hotel room and it was one of the trivia questions. Okay, that's a CIA plant. That's crazy. How they know that? They can't be doing that. That just means that it's listening. That's when you talk about dildos on your phone. Then you get the ads. Jackpot. It's not Amazon or iPhone. It's Does that mean it's a letter? A consonant. Does that mean the apostrophe is a letter? If it's a consonant in that language, A consonant is a phonetic event. T- But vowels must be letters. They are. Vowels and consonants represent mouth sounds. Wait, there's vowels that aren't letters in other languages? I think I think it's Do other languages have vowels and consonants? If an apostrophe is a consonant, it is not a letter. It is a punctuation mark but it still contains the traits of a consonant because it uses the phonetic think vowels and consonants are just part of the language overall. Right? And then letters are the best way to I guess until now letters or writing is the best way to display that. The way I've looked at vowels and consonants up to this point is it it's the you were presupposing that it's a letter but they have different uses and that is why it's either a vowel or a consonant based on its phonetic use. I think vowels and consonants literally are like types of sounds your mouth can make and they're like removed from that which I guess is all that's kind of all that is in a way. That's Yeah, exactly. You speak it. But I guess Yeah. Yeah. I guess it wouldn't matter how we spell words if we never had to say them. That's right. That's crazy. That's right. We could spell a word with 10 Rs in a row and we'd be like, "Oh, that's that's Yeah. There's a linguistics chart which is really funny. It shows all the sounds that a human mouth can make and some of them you can't cross because of the tongue and the teeth. They can't. It's very interesting. I We got to I bet there's a guy who can get there. That's what I was thinking. I think like Jean Simmons. Yeah. Or like the guy the the phonetic equivalent of being able to lick your elbow. It's like getting a box controller. It's like that wasn't consistent until we invented the tongue shape. Marilyn Manson took out two ribs to say like what if we like you know how like girls will get like the the split tongue? I was going to say that. What if we got like a tongue with holes? Like a box you'd take home a pet in and then you can like bend it. Okay. And there's holes in it and you can blow air through it and then there's some sort of letter you unlock. Like what if we what if we get like like uh like flea letter flea. I know what you're saying. I think and we don't have that. I can't even say it with my weird tongue. You know, it's funny. Zipper once went to Iceland and that's not a joke and he came back saying a bunch of Icelandic phrases and they were crazy like they they like they get really accustomed there. Yeah. Um anyway, nuke it. It's cuz they speak the old [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Anyway, nuke it. Nuke it. Got to nuke something. Yep. We don't need to nuke. Got to nuke something. That's my favorite Simpsons joke on the trip. Uh ding. I think Europeans might be autistic. Oh, really? I think we were at we were at a restaurant and we were we're talking to our server and he, you know, he asked us where we're from and we're like, "Yeah, Los Angeles." And he's like, "Oh, never been there. Uh, don't don't don't think I want to go there." And we're like, "Yeah, yeah, whatever. Fair enough." He's like, "It's just uh there's really nothing for me there. Like, I just can't think of any reason to go." And we're like, "Yes." So it's like it's just it's not my type of place. I'm like got dude this is I I get it. I get it. It's not that great. I get it. It was just like the most insane going through like you that the third layer of of I don't want to go to the United States. And I'm like I totally I understand. I understand. You're just digging the knife in. I love when he's had too much. I know cuz he never has too much. He's like this social interaction too much for me. Wait or take it back. which is the I'm on the other end of that spectrum, no pun intended, where they're mostly too much and I start vibrating. No, I think I'm pretty I'm fine. Anyway, uh Sanch was playing time guessesser on stream the other day. I've been playing Hollow Night again cuz I got yelled at on Twitter for it and uh dude, it was just a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] picture of a nuclear bomb explosion at Bikini Atoll. It was a crazy I think I'm going to clip it and post it. Get it right. Uh no, he was like, "Is this Japan?" were like, "No, this is like not Japan. This is on a beach. This is a test." And I'm like, "You're smarter than this, bro." But it was crazy. It's like Time guesser and it's a nuclear bomb mushroom. That's crazy, man. It was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy. We don't need to be putting that in. Yeah, it just doesn't mean to make the cut. I wonder what this was. I want Time guessing, but it's Aiden five minutes ago. And he's like, it's like a camera behind. He's like, "Yeah, I should have this way." It's a blurry picture. Or it's him being like, "Yeah, we had an idea. What about me?" Like, maybe, dude, let's do a mewing picture. Like a mewing thumbnail. Let's all mew. We learned to mute. Didn't we have an episode called We learned to mute. Dude, Anony's is so You lost it. You lost it. You look weird. What? You looked handsome before. Now you look so funny. That way. You look like you're You're trying to not let the puke come out of your mouth. I'm trying. I feel like I'm doing nothing different. Hold on. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You lost it. You was gone. What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] We did. We did do a muing. I think there's an episode called We learned a mute. Yeah, I think we did already. It was with Dude, we're becoming the Simpsons of it. But we You know what we should do way more often that we never do? We got to We got to It's so hard every week for me to to title every episode and thumbnail every episode. We We should just mention one thing right now that lets me put in a title. Okay. Like Mr. Beast Loo uh you know Dubai chocolate and now I can call the episode whatever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I want. Do you think that you brought it up? Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh what's really hot right now is that people keep dying on kick. Oh yeah. Uh one one guy did, right? You see that the the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] owner of Kick was like a top don donator to a guy that died that died and the donations would be used for the guy to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to himself on stream, bro. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Yep. Yeah. Mhm. Anyway, we covered that. So, let's move on. Now, we get to did what? What? Did what? To who? Speaking of kick, uh, dude, we have been back on watching train and it is so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] funny cuz Kyle is the only one with a a kick account so he can chat. Oh, that's why there's Okay. Yeah, that's why this there's these [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] screenshots in the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Discord of the boys Discord where it's it's Kyle going Hold on, see if I can find it. He said, "Oh, here it is." He's cuz Kyle's Kyle's in Canada, too. And he's like, "One time I saw a train walking out of a Starbucks and I was like, I should hang out with him." And then and then we're like, "He's probably got like security, man. Like, you probably get shot." But then he was like, "Hey, what's up, Train? Big fan. If you ever want to grab breakfast at the Denny's on Robson, hit me up, man. They got a veggie burger now for me." Cuz Kyle is vegan. So he's What else did he say? So funny. It's just like It's We'll just tell him to say things and then he'll type it. He said something like just need you to make me [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] squirm, bro. Dude, talking talking to streamers and including details, acting like they know you is so good. Like Kyle being like, "Dude, let's hang out. You know, I don't like bubbly soda, so let's not have any of that." You know, my tummy hurts when I drink that bubbly. Yeah. It's a weird pastime that we have with Kyle specifically cuz we did the same thing to Stewie 2K. We were all at a tournament and at night and Stewie was streaming and we just kept asking him, "Answer the question, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Answer it, pussy." Kyle loves I think one time Kyle posted his real address in Valerant chat. He likes doing he's done this more than once. He loves He loves just like putting himself at peril. Yeah. Online. He doesn't care what happens to him. It's so cool. He drives a motorcycle. He lives in Canada. Who's If he lives in America, I don't know if he'd have that gangster. He loves Dude, if he finds out somebody that is running it down in a CS game is from Vancouver also. Oh, he's like I don't meet me right [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] here at the big post his address and says meet up tomorrow. Like it is the most It's funny cuz that would the cool thing about video games is that would never end up being a real fight. You you would become lifelong friends with that person. No, it's like it's like a when Miles and Kayn were beefing with those guys on CS Wingman and then they just started hanging out with one and then I think it was Josh who ended up living with one of them. One of them ended up living with the guy just like two randoms on CS. That's so crazy. Yeah. I I think I think about that sometimes when I stream. It's like if there I'm being trolled right now when which is annoying, but if there is a group of friends in a Discord doing it as a collective fun activity, I'm like, well, that's just good clean fun. Yeah. And I I kind of like hope that that's the case sometimes. You know, I can be a lull cow if it means friends can connect. And I like that. Josh's girlfriend has been streaming sometimes and uh did you watch and and kind of so Zipper 3 Zipper 3 knew about this. I didn't know about this and she's like she's streaming like I'm going to tune in. So she clicks into a Twitch stream and it's I think it's of of like Overwatch. She's playing Tears of the Kingdom and she's probably the most dog [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] player I've ever seen in my life. But but I'm watching a stream of of Overwatch. Okay. and it has no webcam and and my thought is oh like she's enjoying some Overwatch I guess and then and then my girlfriend types in hey boo in the chat and then we're watching and we're listening to the stream and like kind of some times going by realize we're just watching a random guy play Overwatch. No [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] way. And it's not Josh. It's not Josh's girlfriend at all. And then and then and she's and they have almost the exact same Twitch handles. So, she just typed in, "Hey, Boo in this random guy's chat and then and then we found the Tears of the Kingdom stream." I was going to say, why would she find How would she find Overwatch? Yeah, I don't think she knows what Overwatch is. We we found Tears of the Kingdom and then watched the watch the end of the actual I tuned in for a little bit and I said I can't watch this. She's got to get better at the game. Well, you watched me play Elden Ring. What about when about when you watch you ran at the Tree Sentinel like you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like he owed you money. What about when I stream Breath of the Wild? When you stream Breath of the Wild, it's an adventure because you are you you are pretty good at video games, man. You have that Breath of the Wild. But something stinky ass breathy. But something inside you when you play a single play single player game just falls apart. And I'm there for that. Just don't. It's just hard to click. So lost. It's hard to click X at the right time. Cuz you don't have curiosity. No whimsy. No. I think in that game I have endless curiosity. And that's part of my problem. Well, that's actually a good thing cuz that's what that game's for because all I do is walk around in aimless directions and I'm like, what if I just find a little guy up here or something? Well, that's cool. That's that's why that's a good game is cuz it it lets you do that. Yeah. I like fine little guy. I'm only talking to the white NPCs. Breath of the Wild. In Breath of the Wild, anthropomorphic birds. I'm like, can't talk to that. He's clutching. Link's clutching his rupes. Where did you migrate here from the south? I wanted I wanted Dub to be here cuz I actually wanted to ask him real questions about this view botting [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] But because he's not here, we can say abyss about streamer games is there was a there was one of the people who worked at Red Bull, uh, you know, nice woman doing social media. She was out on the field and she was taking like a beginning of day photo of like everything that's been set up for the event, right? But Lwig's there early and he's on the field and this is secondhand account. She the woman taking the photo for Red Bull says, "Can we can we get that contractor off the field?" And just says that about Lwig cuz she wants the photo clean with nobody in it. And Lwig is the person she's saying to get out of the shot. That's awesome. Oh, is the most Thank you. Christmas. That's great, dude. One of the Cuz the the people that were working the event were dressed as refs, which was really funny. Yeah. Um, fat millennial off the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for my pick. Hey, there's an axe throwing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] place over there, bro. Get the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] over there. Yeah, you lame piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] There's a macho Boba shop around the corner. Go ahead and go get that. There was a guy who was refing the streamer games who had bigger jorts than nut. His jorts were down to his his ankles and they weren't pants because they weren't cut like pants. That's the style right now, man. They were jorts. People are wearing oversized jean shorts right now. That's D. Yeah, but Nut Nut has his and he's like, bro, I'm being mogged. Look. And I'm like, those are the biggest shorts I've ever seen. I love Nut swag. He just wears shorts and a button-d down tea with a tie. Yeah. Yeah, bro. I'm like, well, cuz I was like, Nut, you should just wear the top button only. And he's like, why would you say that? And I'm like, cuz Oh, I unlocked. Okay, nuts. Some swag for you if you're watching this. Top button only cholo wear and then open down the bottom. Tie under the shirt. Oh, so it's like stealing the tie with the open. That's crazy. I've never seen that. I I will say I've never seen it. And then and then jean shorts. Paul Frank logo patch. That would be crazy. Paul Frank embroidered patch. Paul Frank embroidered patch on the on the jean shorts. uh you know, ankle high sock and then maybe some like AS6 or uh I don't know, some sort of trendy running shoe, dude. Um Nut told me cuz he I think he like does social media for the Suns sometimes or he knows someone that does. I forget, but yeah, the Phoenix Suns and apparently their team loves us the yard and Lwick probably. The Suns do. He said, "Didn't you say if we wanted to do the yard the Suns?" Yeah. And I was like, "We'll make it happen." cuz he's like, "Yeah, you guys can do it in the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in the Sun Stadium, like an empty basketball, which would be great." Deon Booker, apparently there's one person there, like an older person that doesn't really like the idea. Really? Yeah. And we can't do it. And so it's they're like it's like a war now. They're fighting. They're fighting for who? Well, if I was the manager at the Phoenix Suns, I wouldn't want Nick moving his arm like that in in my arena. I mean, it's Dude, Archie. Hey, pass me the ball. Stop doing it, Archie. Every time it's a Minecraft creeper. Yeah. No, it's f I can do this. Do it. Fine. Archie will cover it. Look at my fingers. He's like He's It's It's It's so crazy trying to move a door with you. You're like a couple degrees. It's like you're you're Iron Man and then if you move it up a little bit, it's just It's It sucks that they kind of took that, right? Nazis will do something. They'll take something that's normal and modify it slightly. Cool shapes. They took that. They took cool shapes. They took short mustaches. Y they took hand gestures. Yep. And now it's like Michael Jordan. This is like when when people on 4chan like gasolate people into thinking that the okay sign was racist. And then and then it came around the other way where people were like, you shouldn't do this anymore. And I was like, I'm not letting them take this away. It's crazy to lose this. And yeah. Well, there was like the creator of Pepe Frog. He was like, my my frog is being used as a dog whistle and I will not allow Pepe outlasted. I would argue Pepe a lesson. Pepe won for the good. I think also Peipo made it through. Yeah, Peipo helped. Peipo was a good rebrand slightly. Pepe was survived by his son who should not be condemned for the actions of his father. One time in 2018, Lwig said in Discord, which he's never funny in, he said, "Pipo is not responsible for the sins of his father." And I always thought that was really funny. Beat me to it. He's not. I love that guy. He's a good man. That [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that Chunga Sledwig. What do you think he is right now? What do you think he's doing right now? Uh, time in France. Time in Paris. In Perry in g 10:30. How does he know already? Do you have a You have it on your How do you know? Why do you know? I just know. Oh god. He's He's probably into his eighth egg. That's kind of funny. He's into his eighth scrambled egg of the morning cuz he eats 20 eggs every morning. Dude, he's he's shacking up with Michael Reeves because this is Oh my god, Michael's blowing his back off. This is their time away. Their time away together. Oh, Michael's on [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] X of the alphabet already. [Music] Damn, he's Lwig's last. Yeah, Ledwig's been practicing, but he wants to make it last. He wants to take his time with it, man. I actually really we you I think you mentioned us going there in October to film with him. Yeah, we should do that. I really like Paris. I think I think the only downside I think the reason Lewig isn't psyched about us going is he he was just like I don't know like how many tickets there are. I don't know how I think it's cuz we he won't get to enjoy that. Enjoy Oh, the race. No, enjoy Michael. Oh yeah. Yeah. Getting his ass all eaten out for [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I feel like we kind of step to that. L's like, "Can we all just get separate hotel rooms?" And all of a sudden, his room is like, "What's that rhythmic?" That rhythmic sound coming from Lewig's room. Poor Lily. Man, I do want to go. I do want to go if we can get tickets. But uh yeah, sure. I'm down. I don't I am indifferent. I don't care. I want to see Lewig race the car fast. Why don't we go to Evo France in Nice? No, there's an Evo. There's an Evo France. Wait, is when is it? I don't know. Actually, niece would be cool cuz we'd be going somewhere new and we can meet Ledwick's family. We've already met Ledwick's family. No, his like his French family. I swing on his grandfather. Mhm. His 909. His great grandfather swing on him. Oh god. He's had it too good for too long. Catches your fist like this. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] flips you over. Quick break to the neck. You You stop breathing quickly. Evo France October 10th. Wait, that actually weirdly lines up. Is that Dude, imagine we double header two just a two week trip to France. Did you know that? the uh it's just more like all fighting game type [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Did you know DBFZ has a huge French scene? No. Really? Yeah. But they they're Dude, French gaming is strange. It's like they're Hunter Hunter big Nintendo like Nintendo games are like disproportionately popular there. They have huge scenes for like Mario Kart and Ultimate and like those type of games. What is that? I don't know. I don't know where it comes from. Oh, this would be so fun. And all the Europeans get to go cuz a lot of Europeans don't go to Evo America right now cuz it sucks. I think I think it is like that you get to throw turtles at an Italian man cuz do they don't like the Italians over there. Oh, it could just be anti-Italian US. Well, it's also kind of empowering because the Italian man is the star, right? True. So, it's it's kind of like a proxy war of ideas. Is there a French Nintendo character? Ooh. If you dig really deep, I bet there has to be. Yeah. some like 1991 like he was in Super Mario RPG and he spoke in like a French accent. Yeah, it's it's like it's one of the the small sprites from Yoshi Cookie. Are Wario and Waluigi Italian? It's a great question. I think Ei No, they're Greek. What? Dude, that would be Yes, dude. They're Greek. That's so funny cuz they're like kind of like look like Chicky Mac and Benny T. Dude. Yeah, dude. Do you guys Do you guys know the uh like silver alerts they put out? You know, like your Amber Alert Amber Alerts your phone blows up. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know the silver alert, though. Silver Alert is like it's the same thing, but they do it for missing old people. And you get them less often. I don't know if they do them everywhere, but the other morning they they sent one off at like 6:30 or 7 in the morning. So, it it woke me up. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm like, dude, what the hell? Like looking at my phone and part of me is like, it's not not even a kid. I know. But people will get mad at you for saying it. We're all thinking the same thing. So So then, but but there's this interesting thing with Silver Alerts where they put a l they they have a link for the information instead of just giving it all to you. And you open it up, it's a tweet on X. No way. It takes you to X for the Silver Alert. And then all of the replies to this Silver Alert tweet are people just bitching that it woke them up. They're like, "You guys got to stop doing this. You can't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] set this off. You can't send these off too early." And it's like I'm reading the response to like this poor old woman missing. Just like everybody complaining about this. Yeah. They're like blue check crypto accounts being like, "We got to put a stop to these [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] And then like one in 10 is like, "God bless. Hope they find her and then it's just 10 more people complaining. Dude, that is such a snapshot of current day. Literally getting an Amber Alert that Nick Yingling fell in the toilet. God damn it. He's like again son of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Sorry, Michael. I got to take this. Dude, going to Wwig's house is funny cuz Cutie has Playboys on the toilet. Yeah. And I always I whenever I take a dump in their uh toilet and I make I make it stink in there. I always I'm always looking at old boobs. Like I I like thumb through a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Playboy from the 70s just like this is so weird. Yeah. And uh Yeah. Some of the articles are riveting. They got great articles. They have Riley Reed VI in there. Well, the second Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. of House Reed AA of the Akira tribe. That's kind of the ideal time to thumb through, don't you think? It's like the least sexual context imaginable. So, you can really take it the art for what it is. Well, sometimes you are getting uh your poop is so thick that it pushes up against your prop state and you get the poop bumper straight. Hold on. You never had poop boner. I've never gotten a boner taking a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I think that means you have a small prostate because you take giant shits and your prostate should that it's literally called the poo boner for a reason. Turn it on you so quickly. If I turn 30 and go to the damn doctor and get my first [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] finger up my butt and they go, "You have a small prostate. You know that?" I'm going to be so mad that you clock. It's looking the evidence is bad, right? Because he takes the biggest poops. You take Well, do you get morning boners? Yes. Okay. Every morning. So, that's your bladder filling up and pushing against your prostate. Your prostate's a very sensitive little man. That's why you get a morning boner. Yeah. He told us that once in the pod and I never forgot it cuz that's a factoid from a femid. Well, I wanted to know growing up. I was like I was like why you know why do I have my morning wood yet I can pee yet I can relieve myself so easily. Sure. You just have to do a handstand to aim your boner you go in the shower. No, you got to do the You go in the shower and you just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] let it rock. Pressing down doesn't work. No, cuz pressing down stops the flow. It stops the flow. For me it does. For my micro. My flow is uncontrollable. Well, for for Well, it just bends the tube. That's You don't have to do that. If you bend if you bend down, it bends the tube that the pee travels through. You guys are crazy, this is how fat is. I think you have a fat [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tube and big flow. Yeah, tube is like this. My tube's huge. It's like the It's like the blood flow. It's like a boba straw. Yeah, dude. We have to find out, by the way, what we're playing for for Race to Gold. When does this actually start? Is it happening? Probably like this week. Oh my god. Yeah. You know, you know what the saddest thing is? I'm I'm still We're still going to do it, but my League bug is dying. I'm playing and I'm like I'm just not having as much fun. But I'm down still. Wait, what's the You created stipulations. There are rules to the competition. Well, we talked about it. It It was like 150 games max. I thought of a new rule on my flight home, which is I think you should be allowed to dodge, but it it counts as one of your games. Oh, like you can't No, I think that's fine cuz you can only dodge what? Wait, why would you have to Why would you have to add a punishment for dodging? There's already Yeah, there's already punishment built into the game because because if you're dodging tactically for bad matchups or whatever. Yeah, you should have some sort of punishment that like waiting isn't a punishment when the goal is a rank. I think that waiting is a punishment because I it's your time and it's like it's either you dodge and you can dodge once a stream for a five minute break and then you just go on TikTok which is fine. I think that's totally acceptable. If you want no punishment, follow me. I I think cuz I I think also Yeah, I think it's okay. So, I feel like it's a little bit of like a in the YouTube video about the race, it's like and I dodged all the bad matchups. It's like you shouldn't be allowed to do that. So, we could gentlemen that you shouldn't do that. Um cuz I think it's bad for the story, but I think there's other reasons to dodge too. Sometimes it's like your team is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] freaking out. Like Yeah, they're pre they're pre-int. Yeah, they're they're like let's say you're you someone picks like Annie jungle or some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like I I think it's okay. Well, we can't put [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tibbers in the jungle now. Okay.
