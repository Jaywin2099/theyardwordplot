No, it's fine, man. You know what you look like? You look like the Rizzler, the kid. Like, if I had like a like a zoom in, like a like a geoger zoom in on just the back of your head and then I saw the back of the Rizzler's head, I'd be like, that's tough. Mean to both. That is I feel bullied. Anyone else hear that? See that flash? Yeah, I think it was the TV. Oh, it's mean to both of them because the Rizzler is fat.

Oh, now I'm going to cry. You're going to have to call your dad. He's gonna be double upset because I I have to explain to him why flying across the country to go to Apex 2015 to hang out with at 17 years old is actually a good idea. Whoa. It's actually a good idea. And it ended up being bad. What's he up to? Huh? We don't Let's not do that. I should have said let's go. Why can't I tell a story about someone assaulting me sexually? Well, then do you want it to become a a a big talking point for like a week? The assaulter and we're out of the bid. All right. I was assaulted. Yeah, we all were. You were not assaulted. You were not assaulted, dude. That actually even Zipper has a story. Zipper, you got a story. That's crazy. Are you serious? That's crazy. Low key, I feel like the chopped huzz. He never [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] touched my ass or anything. This sucks. Slime's like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] George Santa wishing he was a salter. Yeah. Yeah. The room and slime's like bent over a table. Whoopsy. I dropped my controller. Oh, I think there's a seasick in my ass. Yeah, I guess I'm not wearing any underwear and yours. My balls are out. Oops. Now that sucks, man. Listen, I'm different now because he's different. I got a new heart. Yeah, you have a Is it better or worse? He got a heart transplant. Did it work? He had major heart surgery. He hit as a transplant. It works cuz he's here. Aiden, I'm alive. Aiden, can you tell us? Any day six feet above ground is a good day. Can you tell us exactly how it went? So, you you went to the doctor and then have I described the surgery on the pod before, the procedure? Well, you've I think you've like talked about what it the end result, but not the So, I have I have frequent extra beats. They're called PVC's. And too much love. I have too much love. I actually have so much love. It's 30% extra love, which is insanely high. 30%. I learned that 30% is crazy to have that much love. It's a massive amount of extra beats. And these beats of love, babe. This is why I have to be Pauly. I have to be Look, I just I would love to be like a onewoman guy. I would love to be you all the time. I'd love that. But the doctor said I need [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] snizz. The doctor said I need a The doctor said I need extracurricular sn I would be cool with you seeing other people too but you just don't have that much love so I don't think it would make sense you know I hate the ECS I hate it but I've got to get it it's like a prescription and yeah so next time when I'm you know it's like a Dane Cook movie like it's a hard condition to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] other girls so so it's basically this thing and it overworks your heart basically so it reduces the function of your heart over time because it's working too card uh passively, which is bad. Yeah, I didn't get that. I was like, more beats, more fun. Yeah, but I guess this goes back to the theory I had when I was a child. I was right. Of what? Limited amount of beats. Okay. We got like a billion beats. You're talking Oh, you're talking about heartbeats. You're going through your beats. I thought you were like kind of capping your masturbation. No, no, no. Like heartbeats. You have a limited amount of heartbeats and then you hit your final beat and your heart in a weird way. Those things are linked. Yeah, that's actually true. cuz he up the babies when Well, dude, you know what would be cool? The the the Yardigans have still been posting their like records or whatever. Someone Yes. Stop. Yeah, it's boring now. You're flexing on us at this point. But to to beat off with the lowest heart rate to completion. It would be me. You're saying You're saying Oh, cuz you do it while you sleep. I do it while I sleep in my while I sleep. His 30s. Wait, hold on. The goal is to keep the lowest heart rate at the moment of busting. Well, yes. So, while you're while you're basically when you touch the penis to the time that the a quarter ounce of liquid comes out of your Some doctors would announce me dead when I'm doing it. That is how low my heart rate. You don't understand watch notice. No, it's it's it's basically where it spikes is your m is like where your Okay, so where you spike during the whole pillow princess even when you're beating? Yes. Yeah, that is disgusting. That is disgusting. So, I got this heart condition and so for I've been trying to figure it out for a couple years now and I've went through a couple heart doctors and one of them was like, "Let's go on these pills." And the pills sucked. They make you like really tired and they make you a little fat. Make you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fat. Little [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you fart a lot. So, they make you They make you so weird. Falling asleep on the floor. Yeah. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] make you bald and fart and stink and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Taking for years and you don't want to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] just blist podcast. At first they started to smell even when I tried to control them. It makes you tell the lady at Jimmy Johns you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this is your wife with you but your wife is your tall skinny friend. Those were the pills. Those were the pills all the way back then. They take over. But no I I and then I stopped taking like this sucks and was like whatever. And then uh I found out I had mildly reduced heart function. Anyway, so I go to a new heart doctor and he's like so there's a couple things we can do. We can do what's called an ablation. And so they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Bro, it's crazy. I was nervous about it for so long cuz it sounds crazy. It's an amazingly safe procedure apparently, but they go they open up uh your vein in your near your penis and your balls. You guys want to see my bruise? Yes, I would. Yeah, cuz I saw it last time and I need an update. Is it? And while you do it, I'll explain what an ablation is. So, they cut open his to his blood. Don't don't all of your Don't take the clothes off. Sexy. He's kidding on Jackson. He's shaking his head. What he thinks is a He's waving his head around like he has a long only moving his shoulders. It's a lot of jazz hands. You didn't have to pull down that far. Just don't be showing your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] man. Showing the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Anyway, an ablation is they cut open one of his veins and then they put a drone in it. Yeah, they do. They put a catheter and they basically like file a catheter into your vein up into your heart from your groin. They go through the vein and the vein is strong enough to handle that. I have a question. Yes, please. Yes. Question. Why does Cuz the tube I feel like the tube has to be about the size of the vein, right? The tube has to be pretty big. Smaller. Ideally, it's way smaller because blood has to flow through. Are you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] die [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] How do you make a tube? Here's what I'm wondering. Small. Surely there's a Surely we could start closer to the Wendy's. We don't have to be so low. Apparently, it's like the best spot. That's crazy. I know. Why is it the best spot, dude? They've been doing this for like 30 years and they like to go under your rib cage gangster like me. I go in right here. So, that's actually one for a do you do it uh above. But so you go in and they go in and this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] thing and they go into your in the inside of your heart with this guy and then they start like it like starts pulsing like a bat and like mapping out your heart and then using software they figure out where these electrical signals are coming from that are like wrong and they take the end of the stick, rub up against your heart wall and they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kill the cell. They burn it. Dude, in Osmosis Jones they would shoot it with a gun. I shoot it with a ray gun and Chris Rock says, "Damn, I was not a good Chris Rock." What? The heart since you got a new heart. Chris, you lost your Chris Rock. You lost a do your Peter real quick. Alis, it's still there. Still there. God, Christ. Uh, also, by the way, uh, if you ever watch Osmosis Jones Kid Rock has a song in it. Oh my god. Do you guys know who This is a bit of an aside, but this this is great. Uh he has a song about um I think I guess partying kid rock partying having awesome sex, right? Which is really cool. It's called Cool Daddy Cool. And the the lyric goes uh Zipper got there. So the fastest Zipper's gotten to anything in history. He says, "Young ladies, young ladies, I like them under age." Some say that's statutory. And then a child goes in with the adlib, but I say it's mandatory. There's no way. I I if I'm lying, I'm dying, bro. This was on the osmosis. Young ladies, I like them underage see some say that's statuto, but but I say it's a kid. Yeah. And that's an osmosis Jones. And it's in Caleb put us onto this a couple months ago. I remember cuz he told Nick about it and then I I couldn't remember. I was like, I called him on the phone and I was like, Caleb, what was that Osmosis Jones thing? He instantly recites it from heart. It was so funny. Anyway, uh so they go up and they burn parts of your heart with a little [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] guy and it was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up, bro. I was asleep for most of it, but I was like not under. I was like in drugged state, but they had to wake me up toward the last hour because my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] wasn't true. That's the craziest part. So, they had to wake me up and they're doing it while I'm awake. And it was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy, bro. like you can feel them just like setting fire to the inside of your heart. I feel them. Did you smell your heart? No, I didn't smell my heart, but it probably smell lowkey good like Arby's. Um, and so, so I got this thing cuz you got all that nice chicken in your heart, man. You know, humans have eaten human heart, right? Of course. The Aztec famous yummy, right? I think it would be yuck. Wait, what's his name that used to date Vir did that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Ray. Yeah, Ray ate a human. Oh, what? Who used to date Valkyrie? What was his name? Sony. Oh, Sony D. My [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] used to eat hearts. He was eating hearts. He was eating beef hearts, dude. I don't think he was cuz you were on the beef hearts. He was eating beef hearts. Beef hearts. He was not human hearts. That's so different. I just want to clarify. We're not sure. I forgot that that was the heart. I do think he I tried one human heart. Low key, the liver king might have had a dab. Yeah, the liver came out had a sliver. Some kadaabver heart. Yeah. So, do they There was a 12-year-old kid in a motorcycle accident and he's just eating it. I don't think a kid makes it better. He is screaming though. If he's screaming, if you're eating a human's organ because they're an organ donor in an accident. Is that a Isn't that I think it's the atheist once again. Disgusting man. Yeah. I don't care what you do to my body if I'm dead. Oh, if I'm dead. Okay. Just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] have your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] way with me pieces. Let me tell you, when we you die, we are all going to have our way. Just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dump a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] quarter ounce of whatever you got inside of you into me now cuz I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dead and I don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] care. So he's like quarter ounce today. Yeah. Quartz is a small amount. Do you know how much a quarter ounce? Uh it's enough. It's not that much. It's not a lot. It is enough. It's enough to get a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pregnant. It is enough to get a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pregnant. Yeah. So I get this thing and it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dude it was so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up cuz you guys were asking me like how does it go? Oh, and I I just replied, "There's so much blood on my balls." Because I'm laying on the table and they burn me up. And whether or not it worked, we're not sure yet. It has to like take a little while to see, but it might have failed and cuz it's kind of inaccurate, but they're they're like tying up my um my like vein, I guess. And I'm just I can't feel it cuz I'm numbed up, but there's this guy just working on it. And I can hear him like it it sounds like Edward Scissor Hands when he's doing a shrub. Yes. And he's like And I can just feel like wet hot just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] going down my leg into my groin and like pooling basically at the bottom of my ass and balls. And I said, "Doctor, I can feel uh I think I'm bleeding." Doctor, I feel blood on my balls. And he's like, "Huh?" And he just ignores me and just keeps going. It's like I don't I guess maybe the buzz wasn't lubricated. But what's what was annoying is he finishes up and then this other doctor who's like doing other stuff with me is like uh oh there's blood pooling underneath this guy and then the guy who was cutting me up goes oh and then he leaves. He didn't say cooler than that. Huh? He didn't say cooler than that. No he was very there's a collection of blood under the testicles. No he said it's pooling. He said it's pooling underneath this guy. Okay. And and Yeah. And so I had blood on my balls for like a day. Oh yeah cuz you couldn't shower. I couldn't shower cuz like it might get infected. Next time you get me in there. So yeah, next time we get you in there and we [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You had your period. I had my first period on the operating table. Feels pretty good. The doctor throws a diva cup at you. Like I don't know what this is. Just sliding it into the hole in your leg. Imagine Imagine you're about to go under. You're like you're counting down. You're like seven, eight. And right before you go, the doctor pulls down his mask and it's Aiden. And he's like, "Good night, sweetheart." Yeah. I I I would love it. You'd be fine. You trust him? Yeah. Because it's a like whatever prank is happening to me was worth so much effort. Yeah. And Aiden went through leaps and bounds to get he doesn't do [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that. No. Like he's the like him putting that amount of effort. He's the new Bloodwig, dude. He's like Sherlock and you're like Mori Arti. This is your guys's relationship. You're the psycho genius who follows him around and tortures him with your puzzles and he's just trying to be an autistic guy. Just a gentle autist. You're a chaotic evil autistic guy. Dude, they uh what was I going to say? Oh, yeah. cuz they had me on this like these this twilight sedation which kind of just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you up all day but I wasn't like out of it but I like couldn't really drive and I was kind of like falling over and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but I I took a shower that night uh or no no it was the next day cuz it lasted a little while cuz I couldn't take a shower but I took a shower and shaved my head cuz I'm like I feel gross. I have to shave my head and I did this like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy botch job. It was like it was like a homeless guy, like a crazy man tried to shave my head like without his eyes. And I and I realized I get out of the shower cuz I I've been doing it for so long and I'm pretty good at it. And I get out of the shower and I lay down and it's just like patchy. There's like shaving cream all over. And I was like, "Fuck, this sucks so bad." A homeless guy, but also without his eyes. So really, it's just he just happens to be outside while he does. Well, I hate him. Cuz a regular person without their eyes, he would have killed the job. Oh, you say that, but I shave without looking at myself. Yeah. Yeah. Feel it. You shave without looking. Uh, yeah. That's so impressive. I'm not kidding. You get used to it. Yeah. You just feel your head's crazy. I would have I would miss every day of my No matter how much thing that comes up. Yeah. When you're bald, it's different. And uh when when Northern Lion said he didn't uh shave with a razor, I was like, "Ah, I get it." Married. I think a good good Northern Lion uh piece of merch would be a t-shirt that says bald B A L L apostrophe D and then it's the Jordan logo, but it's it it's or it's the Anan logo and it's him. It's really hard to tell. He doesn't like glasses out in like the silhouette. You cut glasses out and then you don't see the lower half of his body. It's Is there Well, he should have he should have headphones on. Oh, yeah. He would have headphones on. That'd be really funny. That's actually a fire shirt. the Air Jordan logo and his headphones. Ball Northern Lion. Okay, so there you go. It's still on basketball shoes. He still only sells basketball shoes with them. Yeah. Yeah. He has to only come out with his own line and L1's. Do you think that there's any people that will fall in love with our content because they saw the podcast with Northern Lion? Nope. It'll be like tip to tip. They're going to go to the next episode. They're going to be like, "Oh, so this is what I have to say." Pissed off in those comments. About what? I don't think we have it in us. Can I just say it about what? Like before we recorded this episode, love was like, "Guys, we got to let our guests talk more in the first 10 minutes." I did say this. We gotta fight. And we were given Northern Line. He's going to see this. We were given a little bit of hard mode. He was a little bit of a shy Gus at first. He was a little bit of like, "Oh, yeah. I'll wait for them to bring me into the conversation guy." Not like, "I'll outburst with my my in my G." Someone in the comments said his brain was moving at 1,000 miles a minute. Yeah. They gave him like this insane amount of like credit like a like, "No, maybe he just didn't have much to say." I think he was thinking about how high up he was. Yeah. Uh, and you know, so when people are kind of quiet, like we'll we'll kind we'll we'll ham up the quiet moments until until we ask them a question or they're ready. And I think we're not we're not up to the challenge. I think we Dude, we need to ask him a question frame one. Yes, you needed to ask a question frame. You said frame one. What you did is you brought up Yes. You You I asked him a question. I you brought up your you brought up your server and that was 20 minutes in. No, that was like Frank. Yes, it was. It was 20 minutes in. I edited it. I don't care. He doesn't care. How do I fight someone who doesn't care? How do you combat it? 20 minutes. I thought I thought you guys were exaggerating, guys. The pod ended. We go to We go to lunch and they bring up the waiter again. Like the three of you. Oh, no. But you guys are cowards about this. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cowards. What I found out is Nick on the pod, he brought up the waiter and I thought, "Wow." I think we cut it out, right? We took it out. We're talking it was one of very failed and we took it out. You know why it's not a fail? They're Can you explain why they're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cowards? So, you two are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You're a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I didn't even have to say why. You You tiny dick. Okay. So, so am I a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'll tell you why you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] man. I'll tell you why you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] man. Because we we we [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do the pod Nick cut out. You never heard it. brings up a story which is basically him being like, "Gh, we went to this fancy restaurant and the waiter sucks." No, no, no. And that's cringe. And that's how it came And that's how it came off. Oh my Okay. That's how it came off. I believe how that's how it came off. I believe that's not how I said it. So me and the Canadian are sitting there and we're like, damn. And and and it didn't go over well. So we cut it out. And then we go to lunch after and these two start chiming in and they're like, "He really did something." I'm telling you, bro, all of a sudden, all of a sudden they're like a sucks. Where was that? They had nothing that he didn't know anything about the special things. But I didn't think he sucked. I just thought he was saying he sucked. He didn't say he sucked. Sucked. I'm But the takeway history take away the takeaway is that he did suck. If you were listening, that's what the takeaway was. I mean, low key are good. Low key. And I think it is. There it is. Low key. There it comes out. And it came off like LA boy. The essence of my story, what I was trying to say was I was cuz Aiden takes us to this extremely fancy restaurant. They made slime take his hat off when we go. That was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy. When you go to uh sir, uh, could you please take off your ball cap in the restaurant? I'm wearing the shirt of him smoking crack on the back. So I'm like, you don't want me to turn around. Also, my shirt says in Chinese and English, "Work all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] day, only get few money." Yes. Uh, and it's designer. And so, we go in and uh it's like very fancy. And we're like kind of the only people there. And when you go to restaurants like this, you're kind of signing up for like, "Yeah, I'm just going to spend way too much money on food. The waiter's going to explain the entire menu to me. Like, it's going to be a whole thing." And I was just so like I don't to be fair, I don't like that treatment. Like, I don't I don't No, I think he's capping. I'm listening and I know what you're saying. So, wait. When a waiter explains a whole menu, I'm like, "Bro, chill. Let me read the menu, and I will order at some point." I I can't win. I can't wait. We think you like places with specials. You like being treated like you have diapers on. Pizza restaurants have specials. Then you We think you like when they read out the specials. No. Uh, no. Today it's pepperoni. Well, okay. Well, if there's specials, I do I do want to know. I do want to know, but I don't want the whole You know, when they're like, "Would you like me to walk you through the menu?" I don't want that. Uh, I do hate getting walked through the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] menu. I can read. That's what I was saying, though. I believe you. Anyway, uh, and then I just felt like, bro, bro didn't really know anything about the menu. It was kind of doesn't say sparkling or he doesn't offer to hold. It was just kind of confus cuz I he like he brought your fish out and he's trying to tell you what fish are on the plate and he's like, I don't know that one. I'm sitting there going, "Garson, excuse me, Garson." And Zipper was like, Zipper was like, "Oh, I can't pronounce this drink, but I want this one." And usually they like they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they're like secretly French and they pull it out and like that's what it's called. He's like I don't know how to say that either. Yeah. I was just kind of surprised. Not because I had a problem with it. You're just mad there was a chill ass [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] white boy poked up serving food for you. I felt like I went to get like like my like my car fixed and I was like what's that part called? And he's like but did he fix it good? Was the food good? Yeah. He didn't make the damn [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Yeah. Do you know they did the job? I guess I don't know. He could have gone back. I'm pretty sure he didn't. Why can't he didn't look like chef? Oh yeah. Why did he look like he did it? Huh? What does he What does one look like when they make Japanese food? Mexican usually. Yeah, in America. Often times. Yeah, often times in Canada, too. He was a bald white guy with a beard, too. Balding. Yeah, balding. He was holding out. Either way, it was I whenever we go places like that, I I just possess a great deal of internal shame no matter what. I don't even like it. And I'm just kind of sitting there and I'm like, "Yeah, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it. I don't care." He likes the food. And here's the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] drooling over the food. To be clear, I like the guy. My only thing I want out of a waiter is we banter with them and they kind of banter back. That's all I care about at a restaurant. Yeah. So, the guy was fine. I was just kind of like, "How long have you worked here?" It was funny that he didn't know all these things when he kind of should have, but I I don't like the idea that there was a restaurant that expensive in the first place. I don't like it. Fair enough. It freaks me out. Are your hiccups gone? Dude, I've had so it's been so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I have so much juice in me. You do. I have what's called perocarditis. That is what um Don't even try gives you. That's what I Which one's periodontics? Which one's that? That's teeth. Is that teeth? Wait, that's also teeth. You're stupid. We got too many teeth doctors. Orthodontist, dentist, periodontist. Why are they all teeth? I think it's a gum doctor, actually. Uh but yeah, I have Dude, it's been [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. Something is inflamed in my heart because of this thing. It happens and then I have to take pills. But it's created so much acid in my bones that I I had a coffee the other day and I was like terminally hiccuping. It was so sad. We went to dinner all of us and we all have a beautiful meal and then I'm I'm dying cuz the end of the meal comes around I'm I want a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] aagato. You're busting out of your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] shirt. There's buttons on your shirt that weren't even there and then they appeared and popped off. I was I was staring at where our waitress comes out the door for 30 minutes. She hadn't come to the She hadn't come to the table in so long. It had been 30 minutes. I'm just I'm just I'm like I need this before they close. I need cuz they're going to close and I need this avocado. And I flagged out another waiter. I go avocado. Yeah, you said I need avocado. And then our waitress comes and I go avocado. And then she and she goes, "You mean this gentleman right here?" And then she did a cool dance and went stage left. And and then and then I I knew I wasn't alone because you guys sounded off like a chorus behind me and it's like two three four and Slime jumps in and gets off aado and after our brilliant meal we all eat it and Slime starts to go. He's like no. The Tom and Jerry bubble hiccups, dude. It sucked so bad. They were like unlivable. And the avocado gave you uh hiccups and then he went to the bathroom and threw up in the restaurant. You didn't get rid of them. No, it didn't work. You just did it cuz it worked the other night. It worked before. Did you just shove your fingers down your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] No, I just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I wheeled it into existence. He just stood and went, "Wait, you can just throw up like thinking about it?" Yes, I'm the goat. If you If you make throw up noise in action in the bathroom, Yes. convulsing. Also, just staring at a toilet is pretty gross. I can get there, man. I can come real. I'm kind of impressed by that. I'm extremely impressed. What do you think about? Uh, I think about poop in my mouth. It's just gross [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Like I don't know what you think about so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] He's like, "Oh, look. Yum." I I think about a woman who needs my help and the only way is to throw up on the sensor that that drops the cage and I have to do it for her. Yeah. Uh, it still happens. So, no, because I've I went on cuz cutie was saying that night she was like, "Yeah, I had gird." And I'm like, "That's a cool sounding thing to have." Yeah. It's like an elen ring. And so I just eat [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] oatmeals and banana, bro. It sucks, dude. I I'm miserable. My past couple days have been pretty bad, but you know, 6 feet above ground is all you can ask for about [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] good lord. And you don't know if your heart's fixed. I don't know. Maybe it is. I have to I have to wait for it to heal. I don't know. Your shoulders hurt? Yeah, I sle horrible. You slept bad. I slept so bad. Well, it's probably because you sleep don't you sleep on a big like vat of candy corn? Yeah. We just have like right now cuz our house is being constructed on just several bags of candy corn. Yeah.

Let's get back to the podcast where everything we say about each other's significant others is really nice all the time and then we'll see. So, the English uh experts in the room, I have a question, please. I have an English question. Okay, so I'm in Canada. Me and Kyle Web Wipe Shield, the co spreader um are are walking around uh the coup making it stink. And do you guys notice? Are you making it stink? You guys see that? I saw there was a a guy there was someone's tag and his tag was stink. Did I send you that picture? No. No. There was like a trash can that said city of Vancouver stink. And I was like, did I think of that first and then see that or did I see that at the airport? Uh cuz I saw this like at the end last day of my trip. Okay. But I'm wondering now cuz it's it's graffiti. Maybe I saw that. What are the odds that I saw Vancouver stink? Bro, I said this about Aiden months ago. Months ago. What? I was going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] him till it stinks. Yeah. Yeah. I was going to make the first thing I said when we got the car stink. We got in the Uber and I said we're going to make Vancouver stink. I'm just I feel okay. Anyway, doesn't matter. Uh I'm walking in Vancouver and there's a place called uh the Four Brothers Pizza and four and Brothers is brothers with an apostrophe s. Okay. So, I I walked by that and I thought that that was wrong. It is because I was like that's saying that like the four the four brother is the name of the the troop and it's their possessive pizza place. And Kyle said, "No, we do that in Canada." What? And I was like, "Do what?" And he's like, "We will put like apostrophe s there in that situation." And I was I was like, "I think you're wrong." He's spreading co and misinformation. But but I think he's right. He's no. Yeah. I mean, you're the one that I was like, I don't know. Canadian. Cuz I was like, wouldn't the apostrophe go It would go after the S. Apostrophe S is only possessive or is Kyle also drives a motorcycle. So take that for what you want. What if it's for brother is pizza? For brother is pizza. That's exactly what I said. I said that's four brothers is pizza. No, it's four brother is pizza is a reason I So he brother is pizza. Four brother. Was it Wait, was it after? Okay, if it's after that's correct. You're just dumb. Was it after? No wrong, bro. He This is a show. from a man. Just to be clear, there's a 604 area code, which is Vancouver. Yeah. Fro shown evidence from a man. He can't admit that he's wrong. He just screams no. He just You can't just scream no. No. How many times have you been wrong? How many times have you had this happened and no one said anything? Baronstein Bears. It's not Baron Bears, bro. It's not Nelson Mandela. You're a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bro. Four. The conversation was about whether or not it's it's talking about four people or a or a group that is called four brothers. like they like they like they're like the Avengers. All I'm saying is that that's what the the is still wrong. No, it's it's correct. Well, explain it work because if you're if it's a plural if it's a possessive apostrophe for a plural word, then the s goes to indicate plurality and the apostrophe goes to indicate possessiveness. Correct? Like James. But why would you why would they want the possessiveness of the pizza? Four brothers pizza. This is what the conversation is about. It is the four brothers. It changes the pronunciation of the word, right? Because it's the four brothers. Let's say let's say the restaurant kind of like an implied uh like syllable like the brothers. But but but yeah, let's say the restaurant is called Four Brothers. That's the title of the restaurant. It can be both. It both of these are correct. If it had no apostrophe, it's four brothers restaurant. Okay. If it's the four brothers restaurant, that's what that's indicating. But I think you wouldn't you wouldn't want the brother. It's not the brothers pizza. They give the pizza. They can name what they want. They can name it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sucker anonymous. Here's here's what I thought. Maybe Kyle is on to something here because there's differences between uh English and American English often. English, but it's this is the same. And you guys speak proper English. This is the same. I looked up a video today. British English. How to make cuz I was I eat oatmeal now cuz I have to eat like a grandma. So I eat mostly bananas, oatmeal, and dick. These are good food. Grandma, are you eating dick? Unsupervised. And I looked up this this video about how oatmeal is made and it was by it's like this British documentary like and it was this woman and she's going and this part's called the cro and we take the cro and we smush it. I was like this is unserious. I'm sorry bro. I do not people are very part it's the cro is like the I think it's like right don't do that. Don't put a middle finger. It's what they call the tail. Oh usually in there, bro. That's that's experience. That's a Pavlovian response. Aiden lifting his legs up and doing that. I had to teach Janet what that was. I was I was shocked. She didn't know what a a gu was or taint. Janet choco bars. She didn't know what she had never heard of taint. She damn 30 years old. Never heard of a taint gu. What did you teach her? That's your teacher. I I said here's Aiden. Now this is a picture of him rubbing his taint. The secret picture I got of him on the toilet. You have a picture of me. My taint. Well, because when I sneeze my it hurts my taint. No, it doesn't. Yeah. Hank Green told you that you should go to the doctor, did you? Uh, no. I didn't do that. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] He'll probably try to put a stick of heart in your pathetic. He was probably going to try to replace my heart like slimes and trick me. Yeah. Uh, but no, I uh one out of 11 times when I sneeze, it hurts my taint. Like not hurt like like but like a like a like a like Yeah, we've talked about this. You're like prostate cancer, bro. I don't have a a prostate. Let's check it. One out of 11. It's like a purple like a purple case. Do you know how big a prostate can get, by the way? Yes. I'm in that video. I watched the video. I watched the video. Don't ask me. Tennis ball. Yes. Really? Tennis ball. Oo, I bet you could [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nut for an hour. And that's common for older people. This is like It's not like a rare tennis ball. It's like common tennis ball. I'm getting tennis ball in my gu. You're getting tennis ball in your gu and that's pressing up against your pist lines. You would probably feel that, right? You would 100% feel like you'd be like slloshing around and you'd be like, "What's that?" Well, I I think it's taped. I think it's taped to your um bladder. Don't say tap. Taped. I don't know how they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] connected. It's taped on the gas on there. It's flex tape. Yeah, it's on there. It's It's good on there, dude. Just squeezing it like a chocolate orange. That'd be awesome. Oh, it was so gross. I'm more squeamish these days. Yeah, you are. I'm getting like nauseous now from this. Dude, we were eating at this restaurant the other night and Cutie was talking. I won't say what the details like. Maybe she doesn't want me to. But cutie starts a conversation about diarrhea and I'm like she said this on stream. She said she said this on stream. Okay. She loves diarrhea. Cutie [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] herself and she's telling us the story of the food and I I'm like trying to put food in my mouth and I'm literally imagining the food is diarrhea like viscerally. Like I can feel poop going down my throat in my body. And also it's like a friend of mine telling the story. So I'm like now imagining that poop and I was like and I was and I couldn't it was like don't think of a penguin, right? What's cuties poop? I don't want to know. I don't even want to know. You're the one thinking about eating. It's She's a girl, so it doesn't exist. Yeah. Yeah. It's eating. It's ghost poop. It's ghost poop. Um and I was just like I just couldn't eat and I just put the food down until the story was over. And that wasn't always a problem. It was weird dinner conversation. No, that where where else are we to break bread? It was weird. It was weird dinner timed conversation cuz we could have ate. We could have had when we were getting the waters maybe. Where else to break bread? Talk about our bodies. What do you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like? Roman Elon. I What happened to tradition? Our beautiful nation used to get together at dinner and talk about our holes and what comes out of them. Speaking of holes, shake drizzle real quick. Went to watch sinners in I saw it. I saw sinners. You saw sinners. You seen my tweet? I I did not see your tweet. I said, "I like sinners. I too hate the Irish." Good tweet. And we and we and we watch You've all seen it. No, you've all seen Well, haven't seen it. Continue. I guess he hasn't seen it. In it, spoilers. This is a light spoiler. Very light. But in it, there is an Asian couple. Okay. No, that's a spoiler. It's not a spoiler. That's a spoiler. That's a spoiler. The the existence of an Asian couple in the bit of a spoiler. If we're if we're watching a western and there's an Asian couple, I'm I'm gonna be like, "So, there's there's there's an Asian couple, a not specifically a non-insslaved Asian couple in the Wild West." And they run a store uh and and they're helping uh like this uh call him the main character. What's the time period of the movie? I don't know. 1902. Yeah, it's like early 1900s. Uh they're helping they're helping Michael B. Jordan and Michael B. Jordan, right? Set up in it twice. Set up like a little suare. 1902. No, it has to be later than that. Why? Right. Because of the vehicles. Oh, yeah. Probably 1920. 1992. Yes. It could be prohibition era actually. Maybe that's why it works. Anyway, that that's it. That's that's all you need to know. And we get out of the movie. It's in the 30s. We get out of the movies and the first thing Shake Drizzle says, he goes, "But why were there Asians in it?" And then throughout the whole night, he just keeps going around. He's like, "No, he did not. I just don't get No, he did not. Why there was he kept bringing it up? We we walked to a bar and he continues. He was like like for the persistent on it and he was like he was like, "Were there Asian people back then?" Like they never mentioned why. And I was like I was like what are you doing here? And this got the heat off of me immediately because I I had just brought up the show Otani thing because of love stream right because of the the great the heat was immediately transferred to Shake Drizzle. It was excellent. It was great. Yeah. I don't know what's going on with him lately. We should talk to I think some I think it's Drizz. I think the Drizz was talking. Drizz is like venom for him. In Drizz's defense, by the way, Drizz is You should not be confused about Asian people being around if he's constantly DJing esports parties. Drizz, why weren't they dancing? Drizz is Shake Drizzle's DJ name. Just so everyone's on the same wavelength. Yes. Uh, sorry. You were saying about Dre. I remember when I watched Django and Chain the first time. You know that when he when Django is getting sent off to like the mines with that group of slavers and then one of them is one of them's Australian. He's just speaking in an Australian accent. That's like Quinn turned. And I had the same thought. I was like there were Australians back then like kind of genuinely. And I was like why is this Australian like a slaver in the US? Like here's actually why and this is all speculation. It's cuz Quinn Tarantino wanted to say it again, but he needed to do it in a different way to keep the heat off of him. So, so he was like, I'll just be Australia and then I can say it again. Wait, it was Quinn Tarantino acting? Yeah. You never seen Jango and Chain? Yeah. Not in like 12 years. Tarantino is in the movie for like one scene speaking in an Australian accent. Django and Chain. Uh, Smitty Ball. Smitty McCall says it. He might. I don't know if he says it in that scene. Smitty Beall does not say it. You love relax. But I mean look and then I had to look up after and find like the historical context of like why Australians were and there were Australians. There were and and there just were and there were Asians and in American there were but the Drizz sorry stage Drizz being so pissed about it is probably a problem. That's what he kept saying. He's like I'm not mad about it. I just want to know why. Liza, can you look it up? Can you look up where they're Asian people? [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] funny. I'm not mad about it. I'm not mad. Uh I saw it last night actually and I saw it in the theaters and you know what played as previews? A preview for Dandan. What? And I was like, "This looks sick." It is sick. Is that what you've been [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] biting? Yes, man. Yes. I'm like, it wasn't it wasn't live action. It was just like No, it's anime. Why do they like an anime movie or like they're bringing the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Is it a movie? It's a show. Well, why is it a theater trailer? Uh, I don't know. I wouldn't I wouldn't know what the I don't know what the trailer is. Also, trailers are really gross now. I like there's this movie coming out with Benedict Cumberbatch and like Andy Samberg and all these like a lot of like famous people. It sounds awesome. It's not. It's the from the trailer. It's like this movie about this guy who like has a failing marriage and he's trying to get out of his wife's trying to take everything and it's supposed to be a comedy and it's cut together like the most it's cut together I think in in like 1 second cuts. Uh, the roses. It It looks so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Oh, it's a remake. Whatever. Look at all these people in it. It's a hit list. But basically, you watch the trailer and it's this like slop cut, which trailers usually are, but I'm like in no way. Maybe I'm just jaded, but it's like this movie looks so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] terrible. I think our goats are watched washed, I should say, cuz I watched uh the four seasons on Netflix. What was that? It's a show with uh Steve Carell and it's about like three couples who always go on vacation and one couple's going through divorce. Okay. Steve Carell, Will Forte. Oh, I know about that. Uh who's uh not Amy Puller? Who's the other girl? Tina Fey. So, they got some hits. They're all washed, bro. Every they're washed. It is such a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tragedy to to get older and not be funny anymore when it's your only thing. I feel like I feel like like Okay, let's use like Tim Haidker as an example. True. I think he's he's in there. He is, you know, but he's just making only unfunny things right now. Yeah, but at least he's doing it in like it's that fire, huh? It's that fire. Don't you think it's it's like writing too? And a lot of the people you just said like Steve Carell, right? They moved on to more serious roles. They aren't like ser but it's like if you're if you come out of the woodwork and you don't have your fastball anymore for being funny and you're like 60. It's like you just became unattached to like the human experience cuz you're rich now. like you were saying about standup comedians last episode and it's I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like what a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cruel fate. Do you think it's fine if you're only doing serious movies and you're a good you can transition to serious roles but it but if you try to be funny again and you just don't have it cuz being funny is about like being culturally sensitive and and contextually smart and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and it just means you're you're dumb. If you're not funny, you're dumb. Too separated. I think you can make pretty much any funny person unfunny with the wrong role or the wrong script though. I do I also agree. So, you want to see them in like moments where they're doing maybe interviews or red carpets and they're like still got that spark. Yeah. Uh, and if you can't see that, like Adam Scott did he was doing like a severance like interview with all the cast members and he made a joke about something in the show about one of the goats and it was really funny and I'm like that's the real Adam Scott. He's funny. Not this like this like oo severance core. I think that's projected onto him. I don't think I I do too but you know that it doesn't mean it's doesn't exist. I feel there's a lot of good movies coming out. That that one uh Dave Franco Allison Bree movie that looks [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sick. It's like a horror and they're like a couple. Oh, they're married. They're married in real life. In real life. But they're also in They're married in real life and acting in the damn movie together. They're the two stars. Break it up. That's how you solve both cheating in Hollywood. I will only work with my wife. Sorry. No [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kissing or smooching anyone. Sorry, wife guy here. And then I I think that Paul Rudd and Tim Robinson movie looks funny. Yeah, it looks okay. I I want to see that. It's just it's playing in like a week. We're watching that. You can't let yourself not be funny anymore. If it was your only job. Uh yeah. Well, we're talking about people that it's not your their only job, right? But this happen this happens to YouTubers and streamers and it is their only job and that you know what is they just become washed because they get fat and happy. Happy is a big word too. Like I think maybe if you're happier you are less funny, but it's like you can still make it like I don't know. Germa seems pretty happy. Comfort is the devil's success. It is the devil's success. Would you ever act in a movie with Cutie Cinderella? Um he thought he thought about it. He thought about it. That's enough to get her pissed off later. Why did you think about it? Cuz I thought, h this sounds like so much fun. Is it just going to be one time? I thought I thought uh how would I feel about not being the star? You could say that. How would I feel about not being the She'd be so much better than me in the film? Yeah. I actually think she would hate acting. You think so? Yeah, cuz it's so vulnerable in front of so many people. Isn't she like good at that though? Um I think she can talk about diarrhea at dinner. She can do anything. That's true. She's like, "I believe in your pooping girlfriend." And you're making me come around to believe in her. You're welcome. I believe in your pooping girlfriend. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] down her leg. I believe in her. I pulled up uh I was just driving yesterday. I've never seen this. Two people on the side of the road, one car just pounding each other in the face like in a full-on fight on the side of the highway. They were both in uh bow ties, like in suits, and just punching each other in the face. Wait, both in bow ties? Yes. Was it being recorded? Was there a camera? No. Neither a music video. Neither. Nobody else was around. I was driving and I think there was a a situation in front of me where I think everybody was looking while they were in traffic and then two cars in front of me almost hit each other because I think they were watching what was going on to the right. Do they have gloves? Uh, no gloves. Okay. No gloves. They're in full tuxedos with boxing gloves. But one of them was smiling. Like one of them had a big smile on his face and then they were just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] back and forth. You got to just have it out every once in a while. Sometimes you got to have I see another guy in a bow tie in public. It's it's only one of us. Yeah. Only one of us. Yeah. Well, there's my new favorite Instagram account is this guy and I think he's Australian. is like day one fighting my followers and he just goes to a park and then just they both show up in gloves and the moment they see each other it's just onsite and they just start swinging awesome and no day one he gets knocked clean out and he goes and he goes yeah it's day one of fighting my followers until I got knocked out and he's like well that was quick let me know if you want me to do it again and then and then he brought it back and now he's doing it again doing it again is sick because you could kind of cook the books and get knocked out the first time so you or knocked out so you didn't have to keep fighting people. But the fact that he did it again is like he's on like day 11 or something. He wants it. That's me. I hold on to that one for as long as I can and then I just release it later and the series. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You you don't have to keep doing it. I have like short hair in the video. Dude, I was thinking when D and D comes out it'll be such a funny there'll be so many phases of who we were. Dude, my hair is going to go through like watch me age 10 to 100. I was like, "Dude, me, bro." Yeah, yours get real. In episode one, it's short and my hair also. And you have different hats. We're going to wear many different hats, dude. This episode he's wearing the gray one. I was wearing the gray one in that one. It shouldn't be too big of an issue cuz it's not coming out. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Uh May 2026. We're beating them. We're beating GTA. We're going to beat GTA. It's going to beat GTA 6. It comes in. Dude, oh my god. After the pod, it's been it's been the week of elves. The comedy of elves. I misread the tweet after the pod and it goes, "Guys, great idea. Dn D race against GTA 6 and we see if we can come out before." I thought I thought the tweet said 2025. It's like we got D and D before GTA 6. So confused. I was so confused cuz it was like, okay, we'll race to get it out before like December. And it's like we're out of a 13month race. Uh, but Nick thought it was coming out earlier that they had made an announcement to let everyone know they're releasing the game early because the devs did such a good job in May 2025. And I was like, don't you understand? If it was coming out this month, the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] would be closed down. Nobody would be talking about anything else. I was so confused about that part specifically because I the way I read the tweet like I read it as an apology, but I read it as an apology for how long it's been and now here, hey, it's coming now. like, "Sorry for how long it's been. Here's like a soft announcement." Which is dumb in hindsight. Yeah. And you burst open. I'm like such a non like I don't like love GTA. I just like played it casually. So like I don't see that tweet and like put too much thought into figuring it out. Well, it's a it's just a date of a year. Yeah. I just read it. It's just a year a big number on the end of it. And then the date is for brother with an apostrophe before the S. Was there a day attached to it too or just? I think it just said May. No, they just said they said it was going to be this year. Okay. I read before I know exactly. I read it as May 26th. May 26th. It is May 26. Okay. And then this is what I read May 26th. I did read that, but I thought it was 2025. This is when it got delayed to GTA 5 came out 2013. Holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] It's been a long time. They've been cooking on this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for 12 years. That's pretty crazy. That's good though. That's good. 12 years. Going to be the biggest game of all time. Yeah, it will. I didn't even play. I didn't even play. I played. Last one I played was four. Dude, you have five's so sick. Five's so sick, bro. Is it actually? I know. I'm asking it. Because you live in LA, you should also play it because it's like you're kind of there. Awesome. It's actually so sick. That's the coolest reason for me, I think. But I historically GTA has always been one of those games where like I'm like, "This is the dopest [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ever. I got to play this." I play it and I go, "Eh, no. Four. Four was lowkey boring. Five is not boring. I'm telling you the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] truth now. I think my experience with it was playing three on my friend's PC when I would visit him in Canada. And uh we would use like, you know, cheats to up the stars and like see how long you could live. And it was fun. I think I still know the muscle memory for weapons 2 in Vice City. Oh, cuz it was all button commands, right? Yeah. You remember you could get like those thick ass cheat books from like the book fair? Dude, I have like 20 of those, dude. When Wait, so GTA 3 came out. My friend rented it. He got his parents to let us rent it. And there was this bug in the game because the disc was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up where if you would go over a street, the texture would not load. So, it' just be this blue void and you couldn't really it like glitched the game and you couldn't like advance in missions and stuff and we just had to hold that. Like imagine you buy a game from Steam and it like is bugged but your friends is on his computer works. It sucked so bad. I still remember the trauma. And then we just listen to Nelly. Uh did you did you were you allowed to have GTA growing up? Like did you play it when you were a kid at your place? My dad I asked him I was like I want this game. It's called Grand Theft Auto City. He's like okay. and he go he goes with me to the store and he we pick it out and we go to the counter and the guy at the counter he's like um just to let you know this uh this game has uh mature themes like violence, sex, uh drugs, strippers, you know, killing people, things like that. And my dad was like, "So what?" And then just bought it for me. Yeah, it was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I was like that's my that's that's like that that's like Nick's a band teacher from that one story where did where he called your mom in front of the classroom and that guy came out as a pedophile later so came out as a pedophile and so did this game I am a pedophile and it was actually beautiful everyone clapped and thank you thank you for being you were allowed I feel like you could whatever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you wanted I never dared to ask you didn't even ask my parents always come on bro your mom is brain. You don't even care about me. Your mom's awesome. I don't know. Did you talk about seed oils in it? Well, I don't know about this Mario guy. He's a plumber. I don't want you going into those those melee, dude. Of course not. The only time my dad ever showed expressed any concern for what I was watching was when uh I was trying to learn how to play Stacy's mom on drums. And I I was just looping the song in my bedroom and playing it. And uh and if you've seen the music video, there's a hot mom next to the pool wearing wearing a you know a bathing suit. She looks scary. Stacy's mom. Pull up Stacy's mom real quick. Zipper and uh blood's horny. And my dad walked in and I I paused the video cuz someone walked in my room cuz it was just loud music. And he looks at the screen and all he sees is the woman bathing suit by the pool and he thinks I'm watching porn. Oh. And he's like, "Oh." He's like, "Uh." And I was like, "Oh, it's a music video." And he's like, "Your mom know you like this music?" And I was like, "Yes, mom knows I like Stacy's mom." Yeah. Mom knows I like Fountains of Wayne, bro. Damn. Stacy, he's got Yeah, she Damn. And she has a lower hip tattoo. It's like slime's scar. Don't say [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that. Why? It looks cool. Oh my god. Yeah. No, this is almost point. Wait, he's That's your dad. I know it might be wrong. That's your dad. And then that's his face. Oh, I forgot he was jacking off. I don't think he was jacking off. He was definitely jacking off. He was Is the implication not that he was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] beating off? Yeah, the implication that he's looking at. Some of us just pee hard. No, he was he was thinking about her taking her bra off. They interviewed some of us and we have he did have a boner. Wait, they interviewed the child. What did he say? His heart rate was 45. Incredible. Incredible record setting record setting pace. We have to put the kid in the world record book. Like, well, someone had to be there to officiate. He's just an officient. My He became a band teacher in SoCal, though. Like, my Apple Watch gives me updates about what? My heart rate being too low. It gets scary. Yeah. Yeah. It's stressing me out. I wear it less. Why does it stress you out? What are you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] If your heart rate drops, it literally goes like bing bing. Heart rate 38. This could be a medical emergency. Your heart rate gets to 38? Are you serious? Uh, when I'm clutching in CS:GO, when I'm on really fast, usually it's 14. Well, you should get an EKG. I think you might on the watch. You might But like a real one. Wait, what's your What's your average resting heart rate? Uh, like 55. That's normal. That's more normal. Yeah, maybe you have PVCs and you can get the awesome surgery I did and we'd be blood brothers on our balls, brothers. I would refuse a surgery. No, you wouldn't. I would. I would do it myself. I would go eastern and I will pray that my heart gets zapped from within. Oh, and I will control my Osmosis Jones character. If it were up to you, you would have tried acupuncture to fix your burst appendix and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] died on the slopes. Yeah, well, it actually was up to me to be clear. I forgot your appendix forced you to get uh uh like an appendicitis surgery. Um, it did burst. Forgot about that. And it changed me and made me nicer, did it? Mhm. No, it didn't. Yes. appendix holds a lot of anger, emotion. Oh, shut up. Is that where all the like the demon evil Lwig was held? Like that came out during Mario Party? Yeah, actually I have a big theory about this and my chat was making fun of me cuz I was asking Hank Green and he was like, "Yes, like your brain controls 100% of your thought and emotions and I was like, I feel like your gut controls a little bit." Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like your gut and your gut biome and like what? And what did the scientist Hank Green say to that? He goes, cuz the argument where the conversation started it was like such an uncharitable way to speak about that. That's how we talk. It doesn't the argument was or was talking about how a pig liver worked on a human's a human cadaavver. It functioned. Yeah. They hooked up a pig liver to a human cadaver and it worked. And so it Yes. If you replace a a human kidney with a pig kidney, I was saying it would change you. Yeah. Well, the kidney is really just a blood filter. That's I know. If we can replace that with an or that's how they knew it was working because it started dribbling pee. It would change you to some degree slime. I think I've been because I got here this morning and I was just sitting quietly like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] normal man and Nick's like I know you're boiling right now and I was like I'm not boiling. He wasn't boiling. But he was boiling. No, he was you. Seconds later he goes it is crazy that heat. That's because you're trying to get him to simmer. You're like holding the pot down trying to force the heat. Hey, you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] boiling, aren't you, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] God forbid I prod him. You know what I was saying about when we were talking about GTA is that like maybe I've talked about this before, but when San Andreas come out came out, it was like not everyone had it. So, you kind of had to like find a squad that did have it and also whose parents were okay with having the game and also whose parents were okay with having a bunch of kids over and uh Yeah. So, we had to like go to Jordan's place and I feel like that's that's actually a surprisingly small share of the ven diagram. Yeah. No, parents that are simultaneously like chill enough or not responsible enough to like let their kid play GTA and then also also is down to a host. Like my mom would was fine with the video games, but if I had like four friends over, she'd be like, "It's a little too much, you think?" And I'm like I'll be like, "Sorry, bitch." Allowed to play I was only allowed to play GTA if I went to the Hamquist house like a family friend. And but like you never get to sink your teeth in. Beat the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of you. The the the multiplayer GTA land experience is fighting the cops until you die and then passing the controller. Dude, yes. In T4, it was swing set glitch. You guys ever do swing set glitch? I don't know that even. You park you go you go to the first island and you park your car on the swing set and you drive up it slowly and then eventually the game goes I don't know where to put you. And so it just shoots you into the sky. You go like all the way to the top of the skybox and then sometimes if you do it if you do it good enough you can get to another island like all the way across the world and you just explode. It's fine. So you just glitch on the swing set. Did you ever do the Don't be so dismissive. No, I'm I'm I'm I'm interested. It sounds like you don't think the swing set glitch is cool. Cheeky smile. I think I think the swing set glitch Don't smile. I don't smile. Say without a smile. Sounds cool. That's too rough. He's like a divorced dad. That's good. Where the h? Where the h? You did good. Hey, Ludwig. You've been snacking a lot. Yeah, we can just kind of physically tell. We can tell that physically from what you're wearing and how your body looks through. No, do not reach down for that. Do not reach down for that snack. You've had too many snacks. L, we need to get you on some smarter snacks. We need to get you on more quality, enjoyable snacks than the slop you've been eating. I don't believe in that. Well, we're going to make you believe with Hungry Route. I don't think there's a way for me to eat healthy if in at the rate I want to eat because I need a lot of food. Well, that's a good that's actually a good point because hunger can tailor itself to all of your needs. Maybe you put that away for the ad read. I don't think the ad read will really benefit. What does this hunger have? Well, you can make you can make meals in less than 15 minutes. Okay. And there's no high fructose corn syrup, artificial sweeteners, or preservatives of their foods. I'm a very busy man. And I can see you basically have only high fructose corn syrup and artificial sweeteners in your stomach at the moment. Yeah. We're trying to get you off that through hungry route. The opposite of what you're doing already. You're saying I look sweet. Uh I'm saying you're sweet in some ways, but You're sweeter than someone else probably. Look, 15 minutes or less. Give me a few snacks and I'll tell you yum or yuck. Okay. Mini mint cookies. Is that yum or yuck? You didn't say yum or y. I'm sorry. It's yuck. Okay. Fruit jerkys like mango and pineapple. That's yum. Okay. Okay. What about like a full meal? What about like a seared steak Caesar salad? Yeah, that's a good snack. You can use a salad. That's a good snack. Didn't you have the grass-fed ground beef burger the other day? Uh yesterday I had three burgers. Okay. So, it's good to not eat that much cuz it's insane. So good though. I just kept eating and I said, "Cutie, you want two?" And she said, "No." And I was like, "Well, I already cooked four." So, well, papa's eating four himself then. Here we go.

Fill them with sauce and dip your fries in them. Thank you. We should make a GTA. But it's all Yard The Auto. Yeah, The Auto. It's all inside of like a Wendy's. They already kind of have that. Wendy's just in the normal game. Yeah, it is. No, no, all of But we're but we're the size of like a like a toy. So it's still the same size world. So it's like Toy Story but GTA in a Wendy's canes. It's like it's like de rats. You ever play that CS map? No. It's just in a kitchen. You're little tiny guys in a kitchen. So cool. Rats is a great map. Can you look up rats? There's rats everywhere. You love that map, dude. What was the game the It was like this little cartoon guy, but you were It was all about strippers and Larry. Leisure Suit Larry. Leisure Suit Larry. Yeah, it was a is a Goonar game. We don't really have those much anymore. What does that mean? Like to literal jerk off. Just Yeah. Just like a crude game for like adults, but also teens lowkey. Like like a Look at rats, bro. This map's sick. Oh my god. In the kitchen. You never seen this? No. This is sick. This is extremely sick. This should be spawn on the ground. I want you to imagine you're at the major. There's there's hundreds of thousands of people watching. Pause on Chris Cyber Rat Spain. I think it's just the old 1.6 player. It would be such a cool logo. It would be so funny if you were watching Nico and Monosy play on this map at a big tournament. One going cereal. Yeah. He shelf. He's shelf up his cookies. He gets the 4K behind cookies. There's coming through a little mouse hole. I think CTS spawn on the ground. Oh, that is cute. This is cool. Wait, this is is that's the whole map. Yeah, this is mostly vertical. They made it for CS Source. This the source map looks better. Oh, this is like rats throughout the ages. Rats XL, dude. Oh my god, they're in the pipes and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] This is so beast. Damn. Video games are I want to play on that map first. Say about like Toy Story. Some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Video games are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] awesome, huh? What about now? Like I think when I I was growing up, maybe because you had to buy games in stores and you didn't just download everything. There was uh like a popular culture of games like GTA or Manhunt was that one was great. Dude, my friend and I were obsessed with Manhunt. Extremely violent. Zipper, can you look up Manhunt uh Fatalities or whatever? Basically, do you ever play it? No. It was a Rockstar game and it was a stealth game. Very simple gameplay. Kind of boring, honestly. And you you had to assassinate people. And basically there were three ways. The longer you held behind them, you could kill them in more violent ways with a different weapon. And there's like 300. No, that's too many. There's probably like 70 executions. Yeah. Go to one with like a weapon. The machete one with the knife is crazy cuz you just um No. Yeah. Go to Oh, yeah. It's like a screwdriver. Go towards the most viewed. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's a sickle. Oh yeah, that's a sickle up the ass. Yeah. Yeah, dude. Boom. Video games are amazing. Yeah. And this was a Rockstar did this. They were like the controversial guys. This game actually came out for the Wii, which was kind of Why do you want to buy Manhunt 2, I think. And the the I remember what was crazy is, you know how there's like ratings for video games, right? M for mature, T for teen. They released the original release of like the second one was the LA was adults only. It was so violent that it wasn't rated M. Can you turn on the volume? Some of the the sound effects for these are crazy. Is there any like like collectibles or or you just walk around killing all the models? You can get a high score uh in the game. Yeah. The idea is that it's a snuff movie and like so whenever you kill someone, it goes in like a cinematic. We play this game constantly. It was awesome, bro. I can't believe you guys never heard that. But that's that's kind of what I mean is like that game or no that's what I played too but I knew that games like this existed uh and in Grand Theft Auto I I just feel like when you look at games that are popular now or what people play there isn't there aren't mainstream video games that are as edgy or like as controversial. Do you know what I do? You know what I mean? I'm not saying that's a bad thing. It's just interesting. I think it's tough because that game is basically this is violence. this unadulterated violence porn and GTA wasn't really in games. But now those lines are all way pushed out. So if you're trying to cross lines, you're kind of just making like Nazis being good guys type of games. Like you have to go really past something that most people that game a million times now, right? Yeah. What about like so many different ways? Wasn't there a mode in San Andreas where you could like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] somebody? There's a hot coffee mod. It was in the game, but it was unaccessible in the code. And then someone modded the PC version. So you had sex as a mini game and that started a whole insane. Like governors were talking about that, bro. Dude, I tried to mod my Sims so when they woohooed it wouldn't have the sheets and it was such a pathetic image when you remove the sheets, dude. Cuz they don't have balls and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right? It's just Kendall. Yeah. And they still do the spinning thing. The what thing? Spinning. They spin in the bed. It like makes like a cartoon spin. What are they doing? Like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Mario Odyssey spin in the bed for points or something. Yeah. Or like, you know, they It's like when like a really fast person cleans in a cartoon. Yeah. Or it's like when Pig Pen walks around in Charlie Brown. Just a slurry of a mess. Well, I had a fun modding moment recently my whole last seven months. Uh I was So I I had a hard I was looking for footage um like old footage because I lost one of my computers and I'm like trying to see what I lost. I found an old hard drive and this is a hard drive from probably like high school. So I I plug it in and uh I'm going through looking for the footage and there's uh a folder that's labeled uh patch MP which is a COD 4 mod. And back then I definitely would have been trying to download COD 4 mods but I would not known what that file is. Like I would have got that and it would have been like oh this is not what I thought it was. I thought this would be I thought I could put this on a USB stick and put it in my normal Xbox and run it. But now I know what it is. So I was like, "Oh, I could run that." So I put it in my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] console and make it so McDavish and that would be so much better. Was it cool? It was just like a like a shitty promod thing. And I was like, "Oh, I could make this now." You could make it from the ground up. Yeah, I could make this from the ground up. And back then I didn't even know what it was. I like those little moments when you realize like if you were to somehow be able to talk to like little past Nick, you're like, "Hey, buddy." I did that today to Alex. I was like, "Dude, if I knew what I knew now when I was 14, I would have had the dopest summer of alluch summer." I mean, you can do many things. Yeah. No, only for this. No, Nick really grinds this, bro. I was the only one in the office. It's like Saturday night. Yeah, he's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I think I stream to like I can't have hobbies and I get out and it's just Nick alone in the PSL setup and I'm like sub he's like Yoda and he's just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hammering home his QA. Why can't you be happy that Nick's Nick's our son's learning something? I'm just saying he's I'm trying to paint a picture of the less scene moments of Nick. Every time he develops a hobby, you start saying things like and I don't think it's a very positive stock market for our son. We haven't talked about it. PSL was a treat. Okay. PSL was a treat. Not that you two would know. No, he he played a game. Wait, I will play and I did. Okay. I'll go to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I will never go to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] He played a game that went upstairs and played CS. Bro, I will put you to sleep. It was crazy. They wouldn't play CS. Yeah. Yeah. I And I And I was there the whole damn time. It was a treat. It was a treat. And what? I was just saying cuz he's on [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] god mode where he's not allowed to play video games unless he unlocks it with exercise. Yeah. Yeah. And I am doing reverse Ramadan. So, you only eat when the sun is out. That's right. Okay, that's not bad. Thank you. Cuz you wake up late enough that it's just kind of like intermittent fasting. Uh, don't try to make it an insult. Like, you don't wake up early enough to really You wake up so late. That must be hard for you. You're hard on our other son, too. But sometimes he he needs I push I push our kids. And And what's your god mode, mate? Uh, I didn't make one. You didn't make one? No. It's such a No, it's such a joke. I'm tired. I'm tired of this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] This Josh man [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] propaganda. Josh man starts God Mode May. He has all these people, people I've never heard of. He's got like Crudeo. Not I've heard of Crudeau, but he's like Crudeo Sunay all these like smashers and then he's got like some Australian guys like he's just telling everybody it's God mode, bro. Yeah, Josh is new Aiden. And everyone has a spreadsheet and all this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and Josh is just not doing it. What's not he just created this whole thing? God Mode May is a marketing campaign from Josh uh Big Josh aka Sora aka Big Josh and it is it is basically doing some sort of lentl like challenge you pick the things that the best version of yourself would do in life like if you think of idealize the best version of yourself and for one month you do all that and and sometimes people make it small sometimes people make it big but most of the time I think because of Josh's encouragement in lead people make it pretty big and Josh makes it the biggest. And what what is his this year? Well, the thing is his isn't even that crazy. I can let you last year his was insane. Last last year was crazy and then he tapped out of like day two last year. Last year it was unironically like work out an hour a day, read one book per day, save one woman's life every week and and like he just couldn't keep up and then he quit. But still, even though he didn't do God mode last year, he becomes the bastion and leads it. He does become the bastion of God Modem. reads it and and there's like an Excel spreadsheet with everybody's like little list of what they need to do and there's there are name it's like Benji from Australia his is fine it's call fam in his spreadsheet it says fam bam which is his family callam in ya call pup in ya once a week pelatone max 1 hour a day oh he bought the he bought the pelon yeah he's renting using it right resistance training three times a week 20 minutes of reading five times a week no drinking or zins at a tournament at all. He's a professional melee player and meditation practice every day for 15 minutes. So doable. He just hasn't been doing it. How do you know? Wait, because I just know. Call him. You got to check in. Yeah, we definitely got to check in. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Don't put words in his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mouth. Do you have Did you pick things? Do you have things? Uh I do have a god mode. My god mode may is a marathon. Is it to be nice? You just said run a marathon and then you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] took a dump in your pants and left. This is a marathon. It's not run a marathon. I am not drinking in the month of May. No drinking. No drinking alcohol in the month of May. You don't drink a lot. I don't drink a lot, but I just won't drink in the month of May. And I'm also eating good in neighborhood. And I'm running a half marathon. What did you eat today? Record. What do you have today so far? I had a protein bar. That's it. And a tea. Okay. Hey Josh, we're on the podcast and I have some things to ask you. Oh man. What uh can I ask you? How's God mode going? Who sent you? Who? I just I'm just curious because who sent you? Because it's May 5th, Josh, and there's so many days left in May, cuz we're not a week through it. And may the May the fourth be with you, by the way. May the fifth be with you, too, Josh. Now, where are we on the god mode? Have we been keeping up? Yes. like so so much Goding and voting and Maying. It's just going so well. So, we're on day five. I And by the way, I can see the spreadsheet. Oh, no. That's that's more for like your type of people. What is that? I guess like those who are like most likely not going to do it, you know? Right. I'm not even on it. I'm just doing it myself. But you seem to not be putting any check marks in the spreadsheet in your column. See check marks? Weird. I can hear him clicking. Dude, have you read a book? Have you read a damn book? Yes. What book? I have. What book? Uh, it's called It's a bit of a niche one. Atomic Habits. You're still reading Atomic Habits. Josh, you were reading that in 2023. I'm not kidding. Probably didn't read. He's probably some points in that book that I they didn't really sink in the first time. the second readrough. Do you is it that mama mentality? Is it the other one you're reading? Sorry. The thing is I'm kind of like, you know, explaining myself right now. A weird you like kind of snake in the garden of Eden vibes from you right now. Have you did you call Papa this week? The thing is the week. Oh my god. He's only 5 days in May. Starts from the 1st of May, you know. So it's a bit of a rush. Wednesday. All right. Well, I just wanted to see how you're doing because I feel like you do this big campaign, this marketing campaign of Big Josh God Mode May, and then day five comes around and it seems like the Pelaton is collecting a bit of dust. Does this feel good for you to do this? Honestly, yeah, it feels cuz I'm doing mine. I said, you know what I said? No diet Cokes. Okay. Wow. This guy doesn't drink Diet Cokes, guys. This is This is your king. Just like this is like finding out like freaking CEO of PETA isn't like a vegetarian. This is this is unironically the plot of Wizard of the Wizard of Oz. Tim Cook has a Samsung Galaxy. Can I be the lion? All right, Josh. Hey, keep it up. Keep rocking in the free world. He is the wizard. God mode May is a sham. It's a sham. Well, it's not a sham.

He said I've been watching porn all the time. He said I'm porning out constantly. I just want to see. We should make some porn and be like you can't watch it. Oh, you would want to watch it so bad. We're going to all be in a porn. You're going to be in a porn. That would be so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up if you guys did a porn together during this one and then we then we delete it.

And then uh no diet coke, no eating after sundown, which is reverse Ramadan rules, and write a page a day of anything. How much coffee were you drinking a day? Probably like two to four. Dang. I was just I just wanted to cap. I can't even drink coffee cuz it's acid and give me a damn hiccup. Yeah, I I can't drink coffee. This counts as a coffee. Coffee also gives me acid reflux. So, I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I I have to eat like a grandma, bro. You have to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] gum your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Wait, everyone at home? It's a little late, but there's still 3 weeks left to get your god mode. Get on the horse. You don't have to make it big.

Be a slime. and and don't eat the avocado. A good Greek and a bad Greek. Yeah, I'm so glad someone said it. I've been on I've been on the no sugary snacks thing for almost three two and a half three months now. And papa made him cry. And bro, we were in we were in Canada and I was like Kyle's like, "You guys want gelato?" And and Papa's like, "Papa wants gelato. Papa wants cream. Let's get a little cream." And I was like, "I'm on vacation. I can have one snack." Such a pitfall. It hit so good. Oh my. And then we went right to the casino. I turn $100 into $1,500. Like that. It's so awesome. We at the casino right outside. I'm talking to a viewer and I'm like red or black and they say red and I put 500 on red and it just hits. Wow. Clean. It would have been so funny if it breaks for the viewer. It's way fun. Well, you know what was what was awesome in so awesome is is then Aiden's cringe ass. He We're at the blackjack table. We're a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] riot. Me and we and Lewig are on fire with this dealer. And Aiden's like, "I got my Nintendo Switch. I'm out." Oh god. Stop gambling. Aiden sucks. I made $237. I'm out. He just wins and then loses. And we're like, "Bro, the table's hot." The table. He doesn't care. And the dealer loves us and no one else is sitting with us. I made $800. Yeah. Yeah. So, but the table's hot. So, we keep throwing it down. I turned that,000 to 2,000. Love speaking in Japanese to the dealer. Our dealers. And she was impressed. She was like, "Your pronunciation's so good." Our dealer's name is Ya. She's going back to Japan to to to have a vacation in Hokkaido. And I'm telling her all the beautiful there. I'm telling her the spots. You know, she literally knows every spot he brings up and is unimpressed. That's awesome. So, then there's Lake Toya. Uh, and then and then after we hit craps, it was it was not the best stint, but we're still at 2K. Lost $1,000 in 13 minutes. I'm I'm sitting with $2,000 in my hands and I only Canadian and I only put in 500. Yeah. So, it's like 20 bucks. And then and then Nick, Devil Nick goes, "Want to punt it?" I love that. And I always say, "Yeah, I can lost a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ton playing craps." So, I was like, "Let's get it back to craps." What? I went up $100 playing craps for real. Yes. Okay. I lost $1,000 playing crap. The last hand I rolled like a god and I just I bet a lot on myself. Okay. So I say, "Let's punt." And I have 2,000. And so we go to a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] roulette table and and we put a cheeky 500 on red bus. Brick. Put another cheeky 500 on red. Brick. Bus. Yeah. Just do it all at home. Put a cheeky thousand on red. Bricks. Pull out money from the ATM. Now we're leaving. We're going home and and we're waiting for Aiden. God bless Aiden for whatever he was doing. And I look at L. I'm like, and he's like, you want to pull out more money? I had to go to the cashier. So, they thought in the time that it would take me to do that, which is just across the room, they would go to the high roller room and try again. You look You always look for a chance when you're a game. And then the idea was simple. You go to the high roller black check table, you run it two time, you put everything in two time, you you're back. Yeah. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] brick. He he bricked and then I hit my one time and he's like, "You said what you do and I I double it and I I don't hit. I lose." Yeah. So, let it be a lesson to you. Next time you don't take a nap with me and Zipper in the Airbnb, you will lose. I mean, the actually the lesson is Aiden was right. No, the lesson is Oh, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Aiden. Keep gambling, you will win. I went back the next day and I won so big. Okay, sorry. Aiden made way more than you. I don't know if I did. You made 800. I made 800 Canadian. Oh, he made more than me. And you break your switch. You would have made double him. So like you won very big, but No, no, but he's not the the the marker is that I come in with more money or less money. Sure. Sure. But what I'm saying is if some guy who was outside of our table won more than Aiden. If we didn't punt, we'd be happy men. When your switch comes, I'm breaking it in front of you. Don't do that. I wouldn't be happy. I'm traumatized. I'm not going to break it, but I will get it to Mango. The the night would have ended too young. I think it's cuz you you guys weren't with me the last time I gambled and I It was bad. It was bad. Oh yeah, you went to the dark place. That was I went to the dark place for the second time. I think I have the lowest max lost in the casino at in the ring out of us. Yeah, I I think so. For sure. I get too scared. I hate losing a lot of money. I love making a lot of money. That's awesome, dude. Yeah. Yeah, that's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] innovative way to think. That is my It's funny. My most ever lost and my second most are so far apart because of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Chad. Oh yeah. Cuz he was he just makes you He's down so much more than you that he just makes you think it's it would be wrong to not lose money like more. Yeah. I mean I do that but you don't follow my No, cuz you break off from the group. You do break off. He is a social gambler. You go on your own mission and come back down your way to the return in the hallway with the gun slime dragging it on the ground. That is exactly what happens. Yeah, it is like we gambling with slime. He'll lose like 50 at the table we're all sitting at and be like, "All right, be right back." And then you'll you won't see him for 4 hours and then later you'll see him and be like, "I'm down $17,000." What happened? Be like, "I'm up $15,000." It happens like that. It's crazy. But yeah, I I just end up like a hollow just looking for a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] soul. But if that happened at my table, like if you if you were at our table and you were losing that much money, you know, I'm just going to start punting. I appreciate that. At least we walk home and we're both like, "Ah, what are you going to do? Fix this cursed world." Yeah. I told Lewig the other day when I left this office, I said, "If if you were in jail, I wouldn't bail you out because I couldn't bail you out because I'd be right [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] next to you in the jail being like, "That was a crazy ride, motherfucker." Yeah. If you if you got killed, I wouldn't be at your funeral cuz I'd be in jail for killing the guy that Slime's on this new kick where he doesn't say I love you back to me. He did. He doesn't say it ever. He calls you a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You say it all the time. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I still say it. You just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] make me say it in annoying spots because I didn't I would never weaponize it. I love you. You know what I would do? I would just send him text that miss you love you. But then he would like not see it for a day and now he's see and now he's this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] annoying. feel warm and fuzzy. He's always on your terms. Just feeling fuzzy looking. I got a different heart. But were isn't what you were asking for kind of You've always wanted him to say it on his terms and now he's finally delivered that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] annoying to me. Wait, real quick. Okay, I have to tell a quick story. When we were leaving Vancouver, me and Nick are on the same flight and there's this Asian couple next to us and L, uh, can I move seats? That's what he did. Uh there's a bunch of open seats and they go to Nick. They go, "Can you save our spot for us?" Which is kind of weird because a bunch of open seats. There was Yeah, it was like a huge airport full of open seats. And they're like, "Can you save these spots?" So Nick thought he was getting pranked. But they come back and I see the man. He's wearing a He's wearing a captain's ship hat. And I go, "That's a great hat. Like a boating hat." Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And he goes, "Thank you. I got it 10 years ago. I wear it every cruise." And I go, "That's awesome." And then we just start to strike up abnormal conversation. And Nick starts doing this thing where he's like just constantly throwing jabs at me to them in a conversation. I do this physically and I was gonna say sometimes you do it for real, but it's but they're landing. So like all they bring up their daughter and and he's like, "Yeah, my daughter went to a really good school." And Nick's like, "Yeah, this guy went to the Harvard Southwest." And he goes, "Uh, ASU." And he goes like this, "Uh, a guy who was like a guy who was totally engaged a second ago." like he he fully gray eye like just doesn't care at all. And then and then right after his wife goes into like a little rant about how like some people are A students and some people are B students and some are C students. This is where she goes. She goes she goes cuz we're talking about how her daughter has she's going to great school. That's awesome. And and she gets great grades and we're like that's so cool. And then and then the wife goes, "Yeah, well, you know, the the the people who get A's, they're very smart, so they work the important jobs." And the people get B's, they're not as smart, but they have a lot of confidence because they don't do their homework and they still get good enough grades. So they end up leading the people get A's. And then the people get C's, they're so dumb that they end up starting companies and become CEOs. And then and then [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Nick looks over to me and he's like, "You should get a load of this guy there. This guy." I I pointed at him and I went, "See." And she was like And she laughed cuz I called him dumb. And I said, "What was your GPA? What was your GPA?" And he was like, "I don't know." You said low or something. She Oh, you said you said 29. And they erupted. Yeah. At the idea of having a 29. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] losing it. They erupted the loudest. They laughed the whole conversation. They laughed. And And And you know what's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up is it's true. Yeah, what they were saying. Yeah, I think there's merit to that. I got C's. I bet you got A's and guess who you're working for. Let's go. You get controlled by the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] idiot. What are they covers? That's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. I've got no atonomy. D's. Yeah, they were like sleeps on floor, farts, but can control it. I was like, whoa. Sort of mystical realism. I ain't I ain't get grades in school. I was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the lunch lady. And I've told this before on the pod. My friend [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the lunch lady after we graduated. To be clear, you weren't getting grades. Nah, I didn't get a single grade in high school. I was just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I was just bagging that lunch. It was give me the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] piece of attendance record every day. There every day 50th time. I was like, I don't know if this is morally correct anymore. I'm going through the lunch line again, boys. I'll see you in a minute. And I grabbed a chocolate milk, too. And I didn't get a single grade. All right. Well, thank you guys for watching the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yard podcast. I hope you guys liked it.
