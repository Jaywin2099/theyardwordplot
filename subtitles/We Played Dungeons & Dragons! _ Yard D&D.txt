 In the shadowed outskirts of Mory, where the living fear to tread, our brave heroes stand encircled by a strange creeping mist, filled with the restless dead. We're surrounded. &gt;&gt; Step aside, Stone Bread. I got this. &gt;&gt; It's Stone Beard. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to get stoned off beer. You know what I mean, fellas? &gt;&gt; Now's not the time. We're about to die. Ran &gt;&gt; Stone Beard, catch. &gt;&gt; Everyone, just let me handle this. &gt;&gt; How about you handle a salad or maybe some vegetables? &gt;&gt; Shut up, Ran. &gt;&gt; Leonus, I can handle this. Shut up, Ran. Leonus, you fire an arrow at the branches above. &gt;&gt; I'm on it. &gt;&gt; And Ran, prepare your blades for combat. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. And Gorg, &gt;&gt; you got it, Stone Bread. While you guys create a diversion, I'll sneak up from behind and then I'll use my magic to make them [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] jizz. Like actual jizz, like from an alive man even though they're still skeletons. &gt;&gt; And it's a romantic thing, but it's also like a sexual thing. And you know, I'm wagging my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] around like a missile. And they like it so much that you guys are able to escape while I entrance them with my penis. It's like a cobra. &gt;&gt; And when I show all the skeletons, they're like, "Why does it even look like that? Cuz I don't &gt;&gt; slime. &gt;&gt; What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] was that? What? That's not how you play D and D. &gt;&gt; It's not how I play D and D. &gt;&gt; No, that's not right. &gt;&gt; Oh, the imagination game full of wonder and magic. Here, let me roll to kill my inner child. It's a &gt;&gt; Dude, dude, you play games. D and D has rules like other games. You're just being &gt;&gt; You guys, D and D is a game of infinite storytelling possibilities. I can take all &gt;&gt; Thank you, D. We appreciate it. We got this. Yeah, D. We've got this, &gt;&gt; guys. Stop. Look, I'm weird. I'm not normal. I make loud noises. I say crazy stuff. Hell, maybe I'm not even that good at DN D. But if you give me a chance, I can be the hero that the Pterodin need. I can do away with all the jizz and the porno and and the big old ropes shooting through the back of a skeleton like a bullet, like an arrow. &gt;&gt; Okay. Ew. &gt;&gt; What I'm trying to say is Dave, let's get back to Great. &gt;&gt; God damn it. This is the third time. Heat. Hello and welcome to the yard DND episode 1, foraging ing day.

Sorry for um, 3 minutes of cinematic intro and then also this. Okay, bye. A hundred years ago, waring kingdoms bound together to repel a demonic invasion from the unspoken hordes. And all of these kingdoms had to put their differences aside to achieve victory and prevent the eradication of all life everywhere. In the wake of this, as part of the peace accord, an agreement was reached that there would be a peacekeeping force. There would be defenders who would bow to no king and no emperor and be able to travel freely and protect people and help everyone wherever they go. Those people are the Pterodin, our noble heroes. And although this is our first episode, this is not actually your first mission. Why don't we start getting into it then? And I think we will begin with you, Ran Kaladus. Now, I know we just saw during our sweet ass introduction what Ran looks like, but for anybody that didn't see it, could you describe what Ran looks like? Oh, baby. Six-pack abs. Siggy hanging out the mouth all times. A collection of siggies that are around my neck that I've scavenged on the ground because I don't let any go to waste. Two swords. Disgusting. It's gross. &gt;&gt; Uh at both side. Why are you guys scoffing? This is my life. Gross. This is my life. &gt;&gt; Cuz you go outside the the outside the inn. &gt;&gt; Shut up. I'm talking. Two swords uh at both sides uh and some slides cuz shoes uh are uncomfortable for me. &gt;&gt; Ran. Uh as you are getting ready for the day, you hear a knock at the door and a familiar voice echoes out. Ran. Ran. Darling, are you awake yet? Come on, wake up, Mom. That's I mean for the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; I'm not your mother, but I've been called mommy once or twice in my time. &gt;&gt; I want to go to school. &gt;&gt; The boy &gt;&gt; door opens up and you see a familiar sight there. She is small. She is pink. She is about the size of a basketball with multiple tentacles coming off of her head into eyes and a large central eye. Each of which has one little glasses lens over it. This is glasses. Your mission handle. &gt;&gt; I forgot about glasses. &gt;&gt; Ran, sweetie, we talked about this, darling. You were supposed to put on your good shirt today. It's forging day. Get out of bed. You know, and when she's looking at you, you see she's got a little purse that is like kind of draped between some of her tentacles to kind of hang off the side here. And a fresh pack just sort of floats over towards you. Oh, &gt;&gt; she's like, "I I know. I know. You're so easy to please." &gt;&gt; Like a pie on a window. So, &gt;&gt; listen, I got to get you to calamities. The other boys are going to be there soon. Okay. Now, just remember, sweetie. Sweetie. And she looks at you and she doesn't have hands, right? But one of her eyes glows slightly and you distinctly feel like something's kind of grabbing you on the side of your face. Like, look at me. Look at me. This eye down here. Look at me in this eye down here. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; It's an important day today. All right. Don't be yourself. &gt;&gt; So when you say that, you say that I feel hurt. It feels like it hurts. &gt;&gt; It's, you know, but here's the thing. I love you enough to say it to your face. The other ones, they only talk behind your back. &gt;&gt; Cool. &gt;&gt; Thanks. &gt;&gt; All right. Do you have reds, by the way? I don't. &gt;&gt; It's, you know, I'll get you some reds. Come on. It's I'm gonna step out of here because that I got a lot of eyes to cover. You get ready. We're gonna go. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, meanwhile, elsewhere, Leonus, I ask you the same question. Uh, who is Leonus? What have you been up to since the last mission? &gt;&gt; I'm a sea elf. Uh, ranger. And so, you're a seal. Se a seal ranger. &gt;&gt; A seal. &gt;&gt; Now, I swim in the water, though. Sea elf. I was I came up in the water. Since our last encounters, I've had a few I've had a few spats with a few of my teammates as of recently, and it's resulted in them harming me and sending me sending me beyond life, if you will. I've shaken to my core because I'm unsure of how uh how this is going to affect me when we go on our next &gt;&gt; Oh my god, I interpreted Oblivion multiple times. Your friends, frankly, I've seen the void and they have not. And they also sent me there. So, it doesn't make me very confident except for Stone Beard, who I love. &gt;&gt; You think he loves You think he cares about you? &gt;&gt; I love I love Stone Beard. &gt;&gt; That's all that counts. You're the giving tree. &gt;&gt; He thinks you're a cat. &gt;&gt; I feel like my my team as of our last few adventures has has rocked my my trust in them, and I fear for for what I have seen, what is to come. &gt;&gt; Uh, and what does Leonus look like? Leonus is a kind of a thin blue figure. His friends sometimes call him ghoulish, which he doesn't like. Long green almost like sea mossy hair and uh strong strong kind of like a a gymnast but not super particularly cuts if you will. &gt;&gt; It's literally a swimmer's body. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Uh Leonus is you are preparing for the day. Your dragon wing bow uh is laying out in front of you, black carved, crackling with ambient electricity. At the window, you hear I get out of my bed, which is it's it's sweaty. It's a little gross. I haven't changed the sheets either because I sweat every night. I can't change the sheets every day. &gt;&gt; Why even bother? &gt;&gt; I get I get up, pop the window. &gt;&gt; You don't see anything? &gt;&gt; I don't I don't like the fact that I keep hearing faceless voices in this period of my life. &gt;&gt; It's It's personally It's rocking me a bit to my core. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. be honestly honest. Okay. Right. I'm I'm here to help. I'm gonna show you what I look like, but I need you not to freak out. Okay? Like, just don't freak out. Just be cool. All you got to do is be cool. Just be cool. &gt;&gt; I'll be cool. &gt;&gt; Be cool. Okay. Be cool. And across the room from you now, like you've gone and opened the window on the other side of the room standing on a table, you see a very small person. Uh, a little man appears just about yay tall with curly red hair and he's wearing all green and he is holding a bow also and he goes, "Hello, &gt;&gt; hi. &gt;&gt; Hi." &gt;&gt; You can't do that. You can't do that. It's a &gt;&gt; tiny bow. &gt;&gt; But my bow is appropriately sized. Okay, that's that's the first thing. Like this this to scale. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; To scale. You see he like flits over towards you and you see when his wings move they move like dragonfly wings and he comes towards you with a very tiny little hand and shakes your hand. He's like that that also that's insulting. That is it. Sorry. My name is Thimble and I'm here to help you. &gt;&gt; Nice to meet you. I I mean how would you help me? &gt;&gt; You know again with the size, bro. Like what does it have to do with your size? like you. &gt;&gt; No, it's I would say that &gt;&gt; York's not here, but I feel like he would have some very accurate assessments of your behavior right now. &gt;&gt; Feeling the waves feel a vibe. &gt;&gt; I'm being I'm being a dick. I don't mean to be that way. I've I've had a rough time lately. I just I You came to my house uninvited. I'm wondering how you can help. &gt;&gt; First of all, I was invited. a sec. Okay. Not only did you open the door, you might recall recently you were sort of sliding to the great beyond, you know, you were heading towards the Lonesome Valley and a voice, a disembodied voice of a very beautiful woman spoke to you and you, Leonus, said, "I will offer you a pact to help me." You said that. She didn't say she didn't offer the pact. You did. &gt;&gt; I did do that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. In fact, would you check the palm of your hand, sir? And when you look at the palm of your hand, the inside of your hand looks like a leaf. And as you're looking at it, it just sort of fades away. Like it kind of burns. And it goes, "But you know what? She's cool. I'm cool. You're cool. &gt;&gt; Thanks." &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, uh, let's not make it weird. I know your friends. I know what they're like. We've been watching you for a while. So, uh, I'm going to do this. And he vanishes. He's like, "I'm still here. I'm just invisible, bro. It's a thing I do." Okay. So, I'm going to be around. I'm going to hang out. You just like call me when you need me. What's I saw like on the way here, people are setting up for a party. They were like, "It's foraging day or something." Is that a &gt;&gt; Can Yeah, it's foraging day. I I think Can I always hear you? Can you Can they hear you, &gt;&gt; Leonus? I exist. Like, I'm just invisible. And he reappears. He's like, "Yeah, I'm I'm here." &gt;&gt; So they like if we go around, this isn't going to be some weird like you're talking to my head and I feel obligated to respond to you, but I look like a freak all the time. &gt;&gt; Is that a thing that happens? &gt;&gt; I think it's in media. &gt;&gt; Well, scrolls. I've read the scroll. It's a back. &gt;&gt; There's some crazy scrolls where it gets like that. &gt;&gt; It's okay. I mean, I'm just going to hang out like around, you know, and you just sort of like like whisper a little and I'll I'll be nearby, bro. I'll be Hey, hey, hey, man. Relax. It's cool. &gt;&gt; You've been you've been through some things. &gt;&gt; Nowhere to go but up now. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Your boy Thimble's got you. &gt;&gt; All right. I think this sounds nice. It's foraging day. We're going to have a nice day together. I think I'll just accept I'll accept that you're here. Thimble. &gt;&gt; Yes, Leonus. &gt;&gt; It's nice to meet you. It it is not your boy. Your boy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Again, uh I tell you what I tell you what. &gt;&gt; Gorg kind of messed with you last time, right? &gt;&gt; Uh yeah. &gt;&gt; How about that? &gt;&gt; How about we get even with him like just a little bit? Just &gt;&gt; just just a little bit. &gt;&gt; Don't get that. &gt;&gt; All right. Cool. I tell you like that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And you see he like floats over and lands on your shoulder. And again, he's this big. He's tiny, but he's like I'm invisible right here. Okay. &gt;&gt; You're light, &gt;&gt; but I lift. &gt;&gt; Yeah. All right. Um, aren't you supposed to be somewhere? &gt;&gt; Gorg, the exact same question. Who's Gorg? What you been up to since the last mission? &gt;&gt; I'm Gorg. I'm a paladin. Okay. I'm very pious. Okay. I'm very powerful. I'm a toral. I'm a staunch 54 and a half. No one thinks it's a problem. No one ever talks about it. I don't really like to talk about it, but no one else really talks about it either. &gt;&gt; You're also 5'4", 450 lbs. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Like you're you're a square. &gt;&gt; I'm like, it's just it's just like pure raw like pious power. When I thrust my trident into the enemy, it just pulses and pulses and pulses with power. &gt;&gt; It's a thing to behold. &gt;&gt; Uh and it's great. I love you know I I look I I bought a lot of heads but end of the day they need me and they know that and I know that Gorg whereas Ran got a gentle knock. You wake up to &gt;&gt; what? [Music] &gt;&gt; What? Gorg immediately on the other side of the door. Uh you see a face that you don't expect to see. Um on a previous mission, we learned that you had an encounter with a dragon. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; In front of you, you see a woman who looks human, but she's got an odd red tinge to her skin in flaming red hair. Yeah. in eyes that you immediately recognize as Josie the dragon that you had an incredibly wild weekend with. &gt;&gt; Dude, hi. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Hi. &gt;&gt; Hey. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, did you get my letters? &gt;&gt; You f you know where I live. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you're very easy to locate, Gorg. You're conspicuous. &gt;&gt; So fun. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um, also I know you got my letters uh because I sent them delivery receipt. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I they're somewhere in there. What is you know it's the forge face. &gt;&gt; She immediately starts pushing on on the on the door. She's like &gt;&gt; okay. Yeah. No, come in please. I &gt;&gt; She &gt;&gt; I got some total tea. &gt;&gt; I thought she were supposed to be like clean. Okay. Just cuz you can't catch diseases doesn't mean everyone else can't. &gt;&gt; I'm a single like man. Like like what do you like? This is how I live. She walks over and she sits on the bed. And although she looks like a person, when she sits, the bed's like, she just like sits down and she goes, "Okay, I wanted to do this differently, but we need to talk." Um, so, um, I didn't know that we were, um, compatible, you might say. Oh, &gt;&gt; okay. &gt;&gt; Please go on. &gt;&gt; You know, and uh there's been a little miracle. And you notice for the first time she's had this sort of like uh silk att uh carrier kind of dangling off of her. It looks like a purse at first and she reaches inside and she pulls out a very small red dragon. &gt;&gt; It's already born. &gt;&gt; It's about the size of a cat. I didn't even have the chance to like &gt;&gt; talk about it. You had a lot of chances, Gorg. &gt;&gt; Hey, what are we going to talk about? &gt;&gt; I Yeah. What would you do? &gt;&gt; Yeah. What would you ask to happen? &gt;&gt; Well, I wouldn't know. I would I would We would have open conversation about our options. That's all. And I think maybe when I didn't read the letters, &gt;&gt; what spells do I have? &gt;&gt; Like smash cut to like all of you like the Thundercats realize George's doing some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] somewhere. God, is it is it cute? &gt;&gt; It's a very small red dragon. It's almost pinkish, kind of like a rosé. When you have my like eyes when you look and the only thing that is different from being a miniatureized version of its mother is on the tip of its tail, it's got a stinger. It like very clearly has like a hook on its tail. &gt;&gt; And she just walks towards you and she goes, "Say hello to your daughter." The moment you touch this little pseudo dragon, it looks you in the eye and you feel a wave of love. &gt;&gt; Not like you fall in love with it. It's broadcasting love to you. Like you just feel it coming off of it. And she nustles her head up against you and she goes and she goes, "Okay, listen. Um, I gotta put some stuff together, you know, like I gotta move caves now. I gotta relocate my horde. Like, I mean, like, life is different now. It's cuz you and I, we weren't supposed to like &gt;&gt; No, I mean, look, I mean, it's, you know, &gt;&gt; I mean, it's a great weekend. &gt;&gt; It was a great weekend. We didn't plan. Yeah. Also, something like that. &gt;&gt; Maybe you should get checked out for like tortifilis. I mean, but you look fine. You look good. You look great. I said you can't catch diseases. So, great. Fine. Um but um maybe be careful in the future though cuz um you might be a carrier. It's fine. &gt;&gt; But but listen, &gt;&gt; in our culture, the fathers name the babies. &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; so I'm going to let you name our child. And when she's looking at you, her human eyes completely become the red dragon eyes, like in her face. She's like, &gt;&gt; "If you name our daughter something stupid, I'll wreck all this shit." Okay? Like I don't care about foraging day. I'll mess this up for everybody. Okay. &gt;&gt; Foraging day. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So Gayorg Jr. is like out of the &gt;&gt; I I was just &gt;&gt; It's You have a dragon child. Like this is really your chance to like do something cool. My name is Shy. That's a great dragon name, right? Like &gt;&gt; Shy the Magnificent for anybody that's keeping score. That's uh &gt;&gt; Yeah, I didn't was your last name. Um &gt;&gt; that's Well, we I mean we weren't doing names. This wasn't This was not supposed to happen. &gt;&gt; Well, she is cute. Is it like a cat? Is it like or is it like I have to like teach it, you know? &gt;&gt; Like send it to school. &gt;&gt; She Okay, first of all, she's a baby. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; she's a baby. &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; that's good. &gt;&gt; I mean, she's going to learn stuff. &gt;&gt; And And you notice that as you're holding her, she's kind of looking around the room, you just keep feeling waves of emotion. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Like if you um I don't know. What do you think Gorg would have had for dinner last night? There's some leftovers. &gt;&gt; Well, when she looks towards the bowl of slob, like you feel like she wants it. &gt;&gt; She wants a slop. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; She's like, "You can't feed the baby SL." You know what? Let me Let me stop. &gt;&gt; It's good. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to I'm not going to helicopter mom. I'm not going to helicopter mom. Um listen, &gt;&gt; she reaches in her pocket and she pulls out a small red gem, uh which you immediately recognize as a sending stone. You can you can use it to call her. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; She's like, "I'm going to leave you with your daughter for a little while." &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; I'm going to go do some stuff and then if you need me, call. Okay. &gt;&gt; Just York, I cannot emphasize. I will ruin all of this. &gt;&gt; No, I I get it. No, it's forging. It's like we we like forging day, so we'll we'll be cool. &gt;&gt; And she stands up and she looks back at your bed where it's broken and she actually puts her hand on it. You see it glows for a second and you see it comes back together like &gt;&gt; like the sign in Zelda when you play the song. &gt;&gt; She's like, "Okay, &gt;&gt; thank you. &gt;&gt; You're going to you're going to need a crib." I just um &gt;&gt; it's you the dudes you travel with um &gt;&gt; are they going to be cool? Cuz last time we we I mean we didn't have the best you know. Yeah. &gt;&gt; One of them not cool. &gt;&gt; The rest of them chill. &gt;&gt; All right. I you know apologize to Stone Beard. I I'll I'll apologize when I meet him. you get a I don't really feel like transmitting that message around. &gt;&gt; Look, it's and she's like going towards the door. It's just business. You're heroes. I'm a dragon. I Yeah. Right. But it's things have changed now. Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; She goes, "Um maybe um &gt;&gt; maybe once we just like figure some of this stuff out and I get the new cave set up, like we can work out some childcare and you can come back by and we can, you know, I mean, that was a great week. It was a great But again, but more importantly, like I, you know, I would like a shared type of custom. &gt;&gt; We can work that out. Yeah. I mean, you're &gt;&gt; I have the setting stone. So, &gt;&gt; it's it's and and she looks at you and she goes, &gt;&gt; I mean, another adventure, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Another adventure. &gt;&gt; And she like turns and she like looks back at your room one last time and she's like, "Man, you got to move too, &gt;&gt; dude." And last but not least, Stone Beard. &gt;&gt; Okay. Like you see Stone Beard, he's at a pub. It's closed. It has a sign in the front. It says closed for forging day. And Stone Beard's on the floor. He's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. It's like a dwarven salary men pub usually, but no one's there. It's just me. And then my humunulous coots is just trying to push water on me, but I'm just talking. And I'm just like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dragon. There's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dragon and I'm on it. And they're just shooting the dragon. Why you don't shoot it? I fought in war. I fought in war. I was a warrior. And he's beautiful. He's like a beautiful gith Yankee soldier. He almost looks like a small orc. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; That's how buff he is for a gith. Other Gith Yankees are like, "You're a Gith Yankee sometimes, but he's so buff." &gt;&gt; But in this moment, he looks less buff and more like just dell. He looks bad. He looks bad right now. &gt;&gt; And and describe to us what Coots looks like. &gt;&gt; Coots is like a metallic white almost feline looking creature. &gt;&gt; Almost feline. &gt;&gt; No way. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Kind of like if you ever watched uh &gt;&gt; one of your streams or &gt;&gt; was No. Was that guy? &gt;&gt; No. No. Like you know like uh what's his name? Juny from Spy Kids 2. &gt;&gt; Uh and he has that little metallic thing that follows him around. It's like that but feline looking. &gt;&gt; As you are there in Coot's um I'm gonna say the her flamethrower um attachments have also a a water function where there's like little like squirts &gt;&gt; Mario Sunshine &gt;&gt; flood hit by flood. Um, and as you're there on the floor, you hear a pair of boots walking up towards you and a deep rumbling voice that even though he's standing right next to you, sounds like it's off in the distance. Stone Beard, um, would you like some help regaining your wits? &gt;&gt; It was a big dragon. Like, you wouldn't imagine the size of it. Give me around. It's it's you I know you've talked about the dragon a lot. Um &gt;&gt; okay. Um hair of the dog, right? Um can we uh can we get something for him? And off in the distance you hear Oh, sure. Hang on one second. I know exactly what is going to do him right up. And you hear very fast feet like moving around. And right next to you, you get a smell of something that smells like garlic and peppers, like cayenne pepper. Like it just shoots your to your nose like the back of your head as she is like pouring it down your mouth and she goes, "Wake up. Come on. Come on. Wake up." &gt;&gt; Okay. Yes. Stone Beard. Stone Beard pops up instantly does an investigation check on his surroundings. You are on the familiar surroundings of the floor of Calamity's Tavern, which is where you were supposed to meet today. &gt;&gt; And uh Calamity is a cobalt. Uh she is jet black. Um she doesn't make sense because most cobalts are red. She's jet black. You've witnessed she's incredibly fast and incredibly strong. Like nothing adds up for her even though she's only about three feet tall. And whatever she's feeding you, although it tastes like death, you do immediately feel the cobwebs starting to clear. She goes, "Uhhuh. Yeah, boy. You were knocking them back last night, Stone Beard. Uh, I apologize again for that little fiasco with the arm wrestling, but you can't challenge me in my house and have that just go uncontested, sweetie." &gt;&gt; Uh, calamity. I was I was drunk. Just to clarify, like &gt;&gt; it's I understand. &gt;&gt; I fought in war. It's we have heard about that extensively. &gt;&gt; How about men? &gt;&gt; It's I know and and orcs and &gt;&gt; tell me four other githan generals. &gt;&gt; It's personally no it's you are number one. Um and while you look up standing next to her you see the stern face of San Kofa the wizard who's been training you through all of this. Uh he is wearing long flowing robes. He actually looks nicer than usual. Like this is like his dress uniform. And he has a pair of ruby red glasses that he just sort of like takes off and smooths down his beard. And he says, "Well, first of all, congratulations on being the first to arrive today. I guess having slept here counts." Uh, I used like a little bit of my jacket to cover some throw up my shirt. And I go, "Sir, it's um, allow me." And you see he waves his hand in the vomit and everything like flies off of it. You're immediately like beautiful and immaculate clean. He's like, "And your hair is lovely, beard fluffs out, everything." It's like, I just wanted to have a moment with you before everyone arrives here for forging day. I do intend to present you all as some of our newest recruits and I know how your team can be and I just want to make sure you're ready to be presented to the world and more importantly kind of keep them in line. &gt;&gt; Just want to clarify again, Sir Kofa. Uh there's no other group to work with. &gt;&gt; I can do solo. I've thought about a solo career. &gt;&gt; You know, I realize that you are capable of great things. You have done great things and if you retired today, no one could ask any more of you but you know. And while he's talking to you, he just sort of like scoops Coots up and she actually hops on his shoulder in an act of complete betrayal looking at you with her large coots eyes while he's also talking. You can make a difference, son. You can you can't bring back the men you lost in the war, Stone Beard. But you can keep these ones alive, and you can keep everyone else alive. You're a hero, man. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; I'm somewhere else pissed off right now. &gt;&gt; I'll do it. &gt;&gt; Let's let fate decide what happens next. You three, just grab a d6. One of these cubes. Just for the record, in Dungeons and Dragons, when we're trying to figure out chance, we roll dice. &gt;&gt; Let's just see. &gt;&gt; Six. &gt;&gt; Two. &gt;&gt; Four. &gt;&gt; Four. Rowan, I'm going to give it to you. &gt;&gt; Uh, you know, you were supposed to meet at Calamities. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Uh, as you arrive at the door, you see the scene as described. I would say you walk in as uh Sanc Kofa is sort of taking his hand off of Stone Beard's shoulder. You see Sanc Kofa Stone Beard Calamity whizzing around behind the bar and it is otherwise empty. What's up, Chad Beard? I look at Sanc Kofa with pleading eyes. &gt;&gt; He just mouths to you. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Ran Kaladan. Dude, you look like that's not even my name. You look like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] man. &gt;&gt; Like, &gt;&gt; I gotta be real. You look like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; I've been here since 0400. &gt;&gt; Since the year 400. &gt;&gt; No, earlier this morning. It's like 4 4 in the morning. That's true. He was here at 4 in the morning. I can I can verify that. &gt;&gt; I prepared for the day early. &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah. Oh, you still have the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dog thing with you. That's cool. &gt;&gt; Coots. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's felineesque. How have you been? &gt;&gt; I've I've been good. I've been good. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you look well. &gt;&gt; Uh, I really &gt;&gt; rested. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; Soft hands. &gt;&gt; Nope. With a normal hand. &gt;&gt; You lack discipline. &gt;&gt; Working. No, working hands. I have working hands. I'd say they're tough. Like rock climbers. &gt;&gt; I make you a challenge. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Arm wrestling. &gt;&gt; Deal. 100%. Deal. You [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] suck. You need to deal. &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't know that y'all should have done that, but okay. And you see immediately again it's like Calamity was behind the bar and she's just there moving stuff off of one of the desks here and she goes, "Okay, we're going to do this best of three." Okay, just the first first two first to win twice wins and that's going to be the end of it. Okay, &gt;&gt; my rules. If I win, you must refer to me as sir. &gt;&gt; For how long? &gt;&gt; Till the end of our journeys. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's high stakes, darling. &gt;&gt; Or Stone Beard. And what do I what if I win? &gt;&gt; Call me what you'd like. &gt;&gt; I accept the terms. &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. Put them out here. And you see Kofax actually. He sits down. He goes, "Wow, you guys don't mess around. This is great." Uh, so here's how we're going to do this for your arm wrestling athletics check, which you should have on there. Uh, I would also point out to you, Stone Beard, if you choose to rage, you will have advantage, which means you can roll twice and take the higher one. The moment Calamity says that we're about to arm wrestle, I go into rage and it busts out my shirt and like some beautiful pink heart aura starts bursting out of like my like chest area. Not necessarily my nipples specifically, but just like there's like pink hue coming almost like lactation. &gt;&gt; Can I say what I do? &gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely. &gt;&gt; So, uh I I'm a changeling as you know. So, I just turn into that too &gt;&gt; and I'm I'm just You look like me. &gt;&gt; I look like exactly like the way I got the aura. I a little bit actually probably a little bit more aura. &gt;&gt; You're lactating. &gt;&gt; I feel like I have a little bit more aura than you do. &gt;&gt; And I am lactating. &gt;&gt; I don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] around. &gt;&gt; She goes, "That is that is really something. I must." All right. So, uh again, just uh make an athletics check. &gt;&gt; 19 17. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; But it's not quite so much like ran actually it starts to ripple and even stone like there there's a little more to this guy than you thought actually. &gt;&gt; There's a vein in it. &gt;&gt; But but he does go down. Uh, Calamity standing there and she just like reaches out and like squeezes your arm a little bit and she goes, "I thought you were all showing no go, darling." All right, that's one. Come on, do it again. &gt;&gt; Same thing. Athletics. &gt;&gt; I'm actually It's I'm left-handed. That's the thing. So, we do. &gt;&gt; I remind you that you've got an ability called cutting words where you can talk trash to impose penalties on other people. So, what do you say to him? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I look like I look like you. So, I I before we go, I stand up and I I do one of these. I go, "Really?" &gt;&gt; So, roll a d6 for me. &gt;&gt; D6? &gt;&gt; Yep. The little cubes. &gt;&gt; Four. &gt;&gt; So, whatever you got, Stone Beard, take four off of it. &gt;&gt; After he looks in his pants, I look around the room and I go, I don't even use it anyway. And I rolled an 18 minus 4 14. So 14. So what do you got? &gt;&gt; Nine. &gt;&gt; It's, you know, it's the same thing. It starts moving over Stone Beard like this dude might actually have you. And you look on Sanc Kofa's shoulder and Coots is looking at you and just goes, you know, and boom, you know, and Calamity is standing there and while she's looking at this, Leonus, you walk in just in time to hear the cutting words, to hear this exchange and see Stone Beard put him down. Ah, god. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] A. &gt;&gt; All right, dude. I changed it back. &gt;&gt; Wow. I I I run over to Stone Beard and I'm like, "Nice job." I try to give him a hug. &gt;&gt; An arms length away, please. &gt;&gt; I Sorry, Stone Beard. &gt;&gt; Not while I'm lactating. &gt;&gt; That That was a good job, though. That was a good job. I I think your penis is a regular size. &gt;&gt; Even though I won, I feel like I lost. Uh, Stone Beard, give me a charisma saving throw. &gt;&gt; I'm minus one on rez. &gt;&gt; It's not the thing you're doing. &gt;&gt; You have anti- rez ruled a uh four. &gt;&gt; Tell me something. What is your emotional state right now? Like the truth of it though. Like like in your heart of hearts, how Stone Beard feel at this exact second? Uh, coming off rage, I'm feeling overwhelmed by testosterone, masculinity, and having one, I feel great. &gt;&gt; Give me a perception check. &gt;&gt; One last night. &gt;&gt; 17. &gt;&gt; 17. Okay, Leonus, while you're there and you try and hug him and you kind of have this exchange on the opposite shoulder away from Stone Beard, you hear in your ear goes, "Okay, so remember I said I'm going to look out for you. I got this thing I can do. I kind of can know like how people feel like a little bit of what they're thinking, right? He's feeling super pumped right now." You know, normally he's kind of like, "Oh, the war and blah blah blah." But like right now at this exact second, he's feeling pretty good about himself. Stone Beard, you hear that? &gt;&gt; You hear a little voice talking to Leoness that says everything that I just said? &gt;&gt; I go to him closely. When traveling alone or secretly with others, it's best not to talk to yourself like in the scrolls in the media. &gt;&gt; I'm not I'm not &gt;&gt; We will discuss this later. &gt;&gt; Talking to myself. &gt;&gt; We will discuss this later. &gt;&gt; Okay. Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; I I love media. &gt;&gt; Ran, what say you? &gt;&gt; What say I? Uh, I say you cheated probably. Uh, cuz that's in your nature. You cheat you cheat on your wife. We all know. &gt;&gt; And last, but certainly not least, Gorg. &gt;&gt; What's up, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; We all grown like like the scrolls. &gt;&gt; Oh, I forgot about that. &gt;&gt; Claps like a studio audience. &gt;&gt; Laugh track installed in Coots. Yeah. &gt;&gt; What's going on you guys? I have a crazy morning. It's been really crazy. &gt;&gt; Did you bring her with you? &gt;&gt; Guys, &gt;&gt; beast. &gt;&gt; No. No. No. &gt;&gt; No. Beast. No beast. This is my daughter dragon. &gt;&gt; You see on Coot's face just the eyebrows go and the flamethrower goes. This is my daughter dragon, Gueorg Jr. &gt;&gt; That looks like That looks like the dragon that you guys fought. &gt;&gt; It resembles the beast that almost killed me. &gt;&gt; Well, not just almost killed you. Like people and dragons aren't like reduced to their one thing that you think that you interpreted them doing, right? &gt;&gt; It just seems remarkably similar. &gt;&gt; There was a dragon that tried to get this happen and factually happened. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I know. I was there. &gt;&gt; Hey guys, check this out. I turn I turned to his baby and I started drinking a beer. Don't look. Don't look. &gt;&gt; You see it looks at and you get that same sense of like, oh, all right. Like just like wants the brki coming from the little pseudo dragon. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Also that you pissed right all over your tunic. I remember when we were doing that. We were going to do that dragon fight. You had piss everywhere. &gt;&gt; I didn't I didn't piss. &gt;&gt; Anyway, guys, I just wanted to show you. I'm going to take her to uh I'm gonna get the my my friend to take her to the damn daycare, but we can get going for &gt;&gt; Explain yourself. Does it mean she had sex with a woman? &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Dragon? &gt;&gt; Well, yeah. I mean, like a dra like I &gt;&gt; What dragon? &gt;&gt; I'm a single guy. &gt;&gt; What dragon did you did you force yourself upon? &gt;&gt; Force myself. &gt;&gt; That is quite an allegation. &gt;&gt; This isn't war like you dealt with. &gt;&gt; You That's isn't how we do war. You know that, right? Like that's not &gt;&gt; I was like war. &gt;&gt; So, no. I'm going to say yeah. I mean, look, it's my, you know, I I'll be good on the quests and the the defense uh against the demonic uh stuff, but I just wanted to introduce you my uncles. &gt;&gt; While you say that, while you're holding her there, she sort of scrambles under your arm in your shell and like her head just like pops out of your shell like right next to yours. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; she does that. I just thought that is the baby coming on the missions with us. You see, excitement comes from like she like looks at you and it's like excitement radiates off of her. &gt;&gt; Look, only one of us can have a little guy to come hang out, right? &gt;&gt; She smoked. &gt;&gt; She opens her mouth and like a little puff of smoke starts coming out cuz she is a little red dragon. So, she &gt;&gt; That's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cool. &gt;&gt; She smokes. Most of the time she'll be at daycare. Maybe once in a while she'll come come along on a mission, but I'm not trying to, you know, &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to expose my kid to the damn horrors of the world. She got to get in school learn about Horizon. Okay. &gt;&gt; Um would would you like me to arrange for care for a small half total half dragon? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, that would be uh please. I so desperately need that. &gt;&gt; Does she have a shell? I I have a number of questions. &gt;&gt; Oh, she doesn't have a shell. She Dude, do you have a She doesn't have a shell. &gt;&gt; You shared the bed with the dragon that almost killed me. &gt;&gt; Well, dead. You see, she kind of squirms out out of your shell there and literally flies over towards you, um, Stone Beard, and lands on your shoulder, which you see the flamethrowers on Coots actively light up. But as this thing lands on you, you just feel sorry, just regret, just like coming off of it. Well, the be the beast can stay, but it can't come on missions unless you promise to take care of it. Like immediately like just like wraps around your shoulders. It like almost like a like a throw almost like a dragon around a logo and promptly goes to sleep. You all hear &gt;&gt; she does that &gt;&gt; like coming from the dragon. &gt;&gt; She's kind of cute. &gt;&gt; She's kind of cute, right? That's actually a lot cuter than your little [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] thing. &gt;&gt; I'm not allowed to move. &gt;&gt; Uh, and Sanca looks at you and he goes, I I I think it's a deep sleeper. Like, you're probably Oh, you know, um, we do need to get on with uh today's festivities. Again, forging day celebration here in the Nexus, celebrating the end of the war, &gt;&gt; which I fought in, &gt;&gt; the heroes that made that possible. Okay, we're going to be going to the Nexus soon. We're going to have visiting dignitaries coming from all over the five kingdoms. I am going to present the four of you. Everything is going to be fine. Some people are going to give a speech. Everyone's going to go home. &gt;&gt; So, don't embarrass us, Gorg. Don't embarrass us by dying a bunch like you always did. You killed me. &gt;&gt; You killed me. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it was really easy. &gt;&gt; It was so easy. &gt;&gt; Isn't it crazy how easy that was? &gt;&gt; Your hit points are so low. &gt;&gt; See glasses comes floating in and she's like, "Oh, sorry. I just went and checked each of your homes. I didn't expect you to actually be on time. Bravo. Um, I'm going to tell you guys the same sage wisdom I imparted upon Ran. Please do not be yourselves today. &gt;&gt; What the I didn't even listen to that the first time. It hurts again. &gt;&gt; That is why I am repeating it. Sir, please just do not embarrass yourselves and by extension do not embarrass us. &gt;&gt; I will be what the teran need me to be today. &gt;&gt; S Kofa, I refuse to do a speech today. You know I hate forging day. It's I know. I know. It's It brings up bad memories. I I asked them not to do the fireworks display because that really seemed &gt;&gt; Oh, for the veterans. We'll do fireworks. &gt;&gt; It's that was on us. I realized that was that was that was a valid note. &gt;&gt; What next? A flyover. &gt;&gt; It's Would that be a problem? &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. Um maybe we won't do a flyover. And he looks at looks at glass. I'm like, "Hey, no, no fly over this. Why would we do such a thing? Um, excuse me." And you see, she immediately turns like floats away like out of the out of the bar. He says, "Okay, all you all have to do again, meet the visiting dignitaries, shake their hands, act dignified, and then you can go back to drinking yourself silly and sleeping with random creatures and whatever it is that the rest of you do." Random &gt;&gt; singing gods. &gt;&gt; I say myself. &gt;&gt; What? Really? Is that Is that a thing? It really is. &gt;&gt; I wish I hadn't said that. &gt;&gt; Stone Bread, are you a virgin, &gt;&gt; dude? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] way. &gt;&gt; You're older than me. &gt;&gt; I'm born again. &gt;&gt; Don't let them mock your celibacy. I think it's a good virtue. &gt;&gt; That's the guy. &gt;&gt; Oh, String Bean thinks it's the virtue. &gt;&gt; That's cool. &gt;&gt; It's a virtue. They're gonna hang out and drink diet soda. &gt;&gt; And some of And some of us choose &gt;&gt; to be celibate. &gt;&gt; You shows &gt;&gt; are you also celibate? You see, calamity again is like you you hear the and she's just there and she goes, "Honey, if it's just like you busy and you working and you don't get out and you don't meet the right person like I know a lot of people I can get you whatever you want. I mean there's Gon there's a maybe you might want to try Mindflay. I know they're your ancestral enemies, but I mean those tentacles, Lord, darling. I mean, it's I don't know what you're into. &gt;&gt; Calamity, you continue to talk so freely. I won't go easy the next time we arm wrestle because you know the last couple times. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's Oh, we're doing that. Well, hold on a second. And then you see like calamity. Calamity. &gt;&gt; Who Stone Beard chooses and to lay with or not lay with is Stone Beard's business. &gt;&gt; It's a not lay with by the way. &gt;&gt; Specifically not lay with sound like not lay. And he like puts the glasses on. He's like, "Listen, I just need you all to wear your finery. Come with me. You have just a few more minutes." Okay. Do you do have finery, right? &gt;&gt; I disappear. &gt;&gt; No, you don't. &gt;&gt; I want I I I exit the tat room quietly and without a word. I see a 450lb tortoise attempt to exit quietly. Yeah. Knocks over several tables and drinks and I look at Gorg and I say, "God, &gt;&gt; surely you brought your fineries." &gt;&gt; See, you know what? You know what? Let's Let's let fate decide. Let's roll it. I only play with So, roll a d20 for me. I only play with one house rule that a one always fails and a 20 always succeeds, even on skill checks. So, let's see. Maybe maybe you're going to be sneaky. &gt;&gt; 12. It's I think you have a negative to your stealth if I recall correctly. It's okay, Stone Beard. Uh he is attempting to sneak you off. He's clearly right there, but it is uh it's serviceable. &gt;&gt; I come back in. I'm wearing the the finest fineries available to a toral possible, much like Spongebob when he learns about fine dining. And I step in and I say, "Gentlemen, are we ready? Darling, look at you. Don't you cut a fine silhouette? &gt;&gt; I have a little bow tie. &gt;&gt; You see, he turns and looks at you and does that exact same motion and the ambient scum comes off of you where at least you look like clean and freshly pressed here. He does look at you and he says, "Um, I do think it's important though that you show your your face, Ran. You know, um let people see who you are. You don't have to keep impersonating someone else, you know. &gt;&gt; I don't know what you're talking about. Doing what? &gt;&gt; The man with many faces sometimes fears his own. I put away a notepad. &gt;&gt; I I I I'm like leaned into Coots lighting a cigarette with her flame. Not Cloots. What's your baby's name? &gt;&gt; Junior. By the way, who's sleeping with me right now? &gt;&gt; Junior. I lean in. I'm like squeezing. &gt;&gt; She's sleeping. She's sleeping. &gt;&gt; Go squeeze his baby. The line. &gt;&gt; She can squeeze my baby. It's my baby. He can squeeze the baby for this. &gt;&gt; It's you. &gt;&gt; I like that. Strange people squeeze your baby. is a good thing. You're going to get along fine. &gt;&gt; Do either of you change clothes? &gt;&gt; Well, I grab my pack off my back and I reach in. I think it's a nice tunic day. I slip on my a nice cream tunic instead of my typical green. &gt;&gt; You cream tunic acne. &gt;&gt; Save this. Save this for special occasions. &gt;&gt; You knew it was a big day, so it makes sense that you had it with you there. And he says, um, you you are gonna at least put on a shirt because this one now it's all &gt;&gt; don't put on the shirt, man. I'm not wearing a shirt. If we don't wear shirts together, it makes more it looks like it matters more. &gt;&gt; Sofa, I wave. Do the thing. &gt;&gt; What thing? &gt;&gt; Do put make me look nice. &gt;&gt; I mean, I'm I'm I'm not a fairy godmother, man. Like, I mean, I can have clothes flown in if you &gt;&gt; do sign. I got a dragon on me. I don't want to. He does turn and he just like looks and you see his eyes start glowing. And after a couple of moments, you do see a small army of gnomes, comes like trudging in with like uh trunks that they open up and start pulling clothes out of and like holding up and like trying to wrap around your just like bulky frame. You tell me how does it end up? &gt;&gt; It's like a deep cut V with pink frills. The rest of it looks pretty tough. It's like a overcoat with like some sort of animals pelt and uh shorts. &gt;&gt; Sanca does. He reaches in one of his pouches though and he does pull out a sash that is just covered metals and he's like I did bring this though if you wish to display them. &gt;&gt; Of course not. You know that. &gt;&gt; Come on Stone Bread. You're a hero. &gt;&gt; He just like slowly puts it away and he goes I understand. So any questions before we depart? I I I say, "Can I wear this?" And I when you were all looking away, I put on a tuxedo, but it's all mesh. Like, &gt;&gt; dude, we're not going to the Matrix. &gt;&gt; I like this thing. &gt;&gt; A few moments later, uh, glasses comes floating back over. She has a young woman with her. She might be 18 or 19. She's got long curly blonde hair and she is wearing a very fine gown and glasses says, "Oh, did we neglect to mention that this is going to be an escort mission?" &gt;&gt; She's an escort. &gt;&gt; It's Gorg. You see, she looks at you for a second and one of the eyes flashes and the chair next to you just explodes. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; And she goes, "Christ, I didn't hear. What was that?" No, I must have misunderstood the words that you were just saying. &gt;&gt; I was just saying how how happy I am to do this mission right now. &gt;&gt; Who are we escorting? &gt;&gt; You see, the young woman steps forward and she looks at you and she says, "Um, my name is uh Princess Selenia. I'm from Waldane. Uh, I grew up hearing stories about you. Uh, actually about all of you recently, but you especially. It it is a um it is an honor to meet you, sir. &gt;&gt; State your name, young maiden. &gt;&gt; Uh Princess Selenia. &gt;&gt; Yalissa. &gt;&gt; Princess Selenia. &gt;&gt; Yes. And you are uh Stone Beard. Uh Ron Kaladus. Uh Serg uh in in in Ron. Uh uh sorry. Leonus Aul. Sorry. &gt;&gt; It's nice to meet you, princess. I get down on on my knee and I I try to take her hand and and give her like a little hand spin. &gt;&gt; She immediately starts like blessing like full like And in your ear you hear like that's smooth, bro. That's so smooth. So smooth. Oh, that reminds me. Uh, Gorg, give me a constitution save. &gt;&gt; Yes, chef. &gt;&gt; I know that was bad. &gt;&gt; 20. Uh, sorry. 19 plus one. &gt;&gt; Leonus, in your ear, you go like, you hear, "Oh, yeah. Get even hang on a second." And you hear his little bow creek. And you don't see him. He's invisible, but he's right there. here. A saying you know quite well. In Gorg, there's a little like in your neck. She turns and she goes, "Sir Gorg." In Gorg, the whole world starts spinning. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. That's me, Sir Gorg. &gt;&gt; And boom. You see, Gorg just collapses. &gt;&gt; 450 lbs hitting the floor. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And she goes, "Is he okay?" [Music] &gt;&gt; I whisper, "Good shot." &gt;&gt; We all agree this is a little bit better this way, right? Can I do an investigation check? &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; 21. &gt;&gt; As you sort of like look at him, you do see in his neck a very tiny little arrow. It's about the size of a needle, but it is just &gt;&gt; I'm trying to get in character. &gt;&gt; We're doing it live. We're doing it practical. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Am I able to perceive knowing anything else where it came from? &gt;&gt; I mean, you have No, that's with that. That's &gt;&gt; I just know there's a small arrow in it. &gt;&gt; And he leans down and pulls it out. And when he pulls it out, uh, you regain your faculties. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Oh god, what is going on, guys, with you guys? &gt;&gt; You were just unconscious. &gt;&gt; You were attacked. &gt;&gt; No, I was attacked. &gt;&gt; Well, Sanca does show you a little teeny tiny arrow. &gt;&gt; Dude, someone's trying to kill us all. It reminds me of Stone Beard. Reminds you of Stone Beard. Stone. &gt;&gt; You see the princess looks for a second and she goes, [Laughter] &gt;&gt; "You know he's, you know, he's a virgin." &gt;&gt; Stone beard. Stone beard. Show them. It's a regular size. &gt;&gt; You see a cuff? &gt;&gt; Don't let them disrespect him. &gt;&gt; Puts his hands over her eyes. He's like, "Please don't. Please, please, please don't." &gt;&gt; Anyway, &gt;&gt; she goes, "I I am 19." He go, "Nope. Please, please, &gt;&gt; guys, don't don't show them some beard. &gt;&gt; Who is trying to kill me? Someone's trying to kill all &gt;&gt; clearly no one's trying to kill you. Otherwise, they would have done it. &gt;&gt; Leonus, do you believe this? &gt;&gt; Yorg, it's forging day. You can't just start screaming that somebody's trying to kill you. &gt;&gt; It's forging day. &gt;&gt; Just like &gt;&gt; You know what? You guys are right. &gt;&gt; Maybe just &gt;&gt; dude, I don't think you should do that. &gt;&gt; Why did you do that? &gt;&gt; It's fine. It's like my &gt;&gt; He should not abduct saliva is crazy. He just wuanged the arrow. &gt;&gt; I asked you. He pulls it out of his arm. I I I whispered to to my shoulder. Uh Temple, can can he eat that? &gt;&gt; I I don't think he should have. No, actually. &gt;&gt; Is he Is he going to be okay? I didn't want to. &gt;&gt; I don't know. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. &gt;&gt; My stomach feels crazy. &gt;&gt; Uh S is like, listen. Okay. Yes. I just need you all to keep an eye on the princess. She's here as an observer. I figured this would kind of be a twofer that you guys get some practice on a diplomatic mission and on a security detail. &gt;&gt; It's always a twofer with you, Senova. &gt;&gt; Always a two. It's It's efficiency, &gt;&gt; princess. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You say nothing, you do nothing. You follow us. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Uh you said something. &gt;&gt; It &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, &gt;&gt; forgive him. &gt;&gt; So, I'll give you a little a little tip. Uh women don't really like that. So when you get to your first time, maybe maybe you like listen like you let them talk. Where are we going? &gt;&gt; Commanding women to be quiet. &gt;&gt; Well, in the right moments, it's it's excellent. But here, I feel I feel as if it's wrong. Look at &gt;&gt; it's like a military thing. You know what? Don't mind him, but he's right. We just want to keep you safe, okay? We want to make sure you get to where you need to go all in one piece. And you see GJ sort of flutters and lands on her shoulder too and just like starts nuzzling and she goes, "Oh my horizon. &gt;&gt; That's my That's my daughter dragon cat." &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; It's like a cat. Like you don't have to take care of it. You can just like &gt;&gt; That's not It's very much a dragon. &gt;&gt; But what I'm saying is like I don't have to like take it to school. &gt;&gt; It has a stinger. I think that &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's weird. Isn't it weird? &gt;&gt; Do you have one? &gt;&gt; I don't know. Isn't that funny? I can't look back that I can't like turn my head. &gt;&gt; I love the idea that theoretically you've had a stinger on your little turtle knob this entire time and like never known. Uh Sofa pulls out a stopwatch in or pocket watch and looks at it and he's like, "Yes, um let us proceed. Just keep an eye on the princess. I think glasses was correct. Don't be yourselves and everything's going to be fine. You You look snazzy. You look great." Uh &gt;&gt; I I burst the dust off of my bow tie. &gt;&gt; And you see uh right before you all are leaving, Calamity looks and she goes, "Y'all look magnificent." And once you come back, first round is on me. All right. &gt;&gt; I don't drink that often. &gt;&gt; You see? &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah, sure. &gt;&gt; You tell the best joke, Stone Beard. As you all turn and leave Calamities and you enter into the Nexus, the bar is in this area that everyone comes through to travel. There are portals to multiple lands, multiple kingdoms, multiple towns. This is the primary headquarters of the Tteran. There are places to eat. There are places to buy equipment. Anything that an adventure could need is here. And there's all manner of sensients coming and going as you come out here. There are humans, there are elves, dwarves, gnomes, halflings, minotaurs, bird people, anything that you could think of. And today is an especially important day. There are banners hung. There are streamers. Lots of people are dressed up. You even see the odd child through here because there's not usually children because you all are soldiers after a fashion. But there are some people that have brought their families today. There's kids walking around with balloons and oversized lollipops as it is just a very festive occasion. And as Sanca is sort of walking through here with all of you behind, you see the princess's head is just on an absolute swivel taking all of this in. And people do kind of stop to sort of show their respects to Sanca cuz everybody knows he's important as he's moving through and even looks at you guys going by. And you do hear just sort of in passing which one of them is the dragon [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Meanwhile, I'm I I'm in front of our group and I'm just going 4G dead 4G 4G. &gt;&gt; People just like 4G. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's like people just like saluting you with steines and things as you're moving past. And you all get to a large area where there is a stage set up and a little bit of a crowd is starting to gather, but they aren't there yet. And Sanc Kofa sort of leads you all behind kind of the rope there over towards the side. And he says, "Only thing that we have to do, real simple, is you guys have to meet the dignitaries ahead of them going up and speaking." &gt;&gt; And why are we bringing the princess? &gt;&gt; She's just taking it all in. She's visiting. She's just &gt;&gt; is a tour guide. We're tour guides. &gt;&gt; I mean, it sounds so dismissive when you say &gt;&gt; when an escort mission is point A to point B. &gt;&gt; It's &gt;&gt; we're going point A to point A. &gt;&gt; Well, um, here's here's the thing. Just just bring it in. Bring it in real real real quick here. Do you remember your last escort mission? Um, the person you were supposed to accompany ended up dead. &gt;&gt; That wasn't my doing. &gt;&gt; I told you many times. &gt;&gt; You were in charge of the team. &gt;&gt; I was in charge of the team. I didn't team. &gt;&gt; It's Hey, hey, hey. &gt;&gt; You were in charge of us. &gt;&gt; Leadership is ownership. &gt;&gt; There's leaders and there's followers, but I would rather be a dick than a swallower. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; You You see the princess looks at you and she like opens her mouth like she's going to say something and then just doesn't. I put away my notepad again. &gt;&gt; So this time all you got to do is take this girl around and make sure she has a good time during forging day. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Easy now. &gt;&gt; Princess, would you like balloon? &gt;&gt; They also like deep fry a bunch of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] here if you want to like eat some like deep fried grl. &gt;&gt; I'm not clear on the rules cuz you told me not to talk. So like can can I You You may speak when spoken to. Of course. &gt;&gt; Uh uh. Don't need a balloon. Thank you for that. Deep fried [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] though. Yeah, man. Like like &gt;&gt; do you in your in your princess do do you get the opportunity to eat a lot of fried [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Leon's just trying to get to know the princess. &gt;&gt; So much salad, Leon. Just so much salad. They're like, right. &gt;&gt; I've been eating slop for years and I love it. &gt;&gt; My brothers get roast beast whenever they want, you know, but me I have to be like who like why? &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what, princess. cut loose with us a little bit. &gt;&gt; You do have the figure of someone who's never seen better. &gt;&gt; Are you okay with him commenting on your figure? &gt;&gt; It's it's it's a little weird. &gt;&gt; I mean, but the course is working, right? Like I mean, I don't like &gt;&gt; Yeah, you don't Brett, don't do that, &gt;&gt; bro. You got to be subtle. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; but you got to be subtle. &gt;&gt; I don't understand. &gt;&gt; He's cool. &gt;&gt; She She does just sort of like adjust it a little bit. She's like, does does he mean I look sick? You don't look sick at all. You look great. &gt;&gt; You look great. &gt;&gt; We're going to get some slop, some deep fried stuff. We'll get a balloon. You decide if you want it or not. &gt;&gt; Sanca's like, "We're not going to do any of those right now." And like right when he kind of elbows you, you see across the way coming towards you. So you all are kind of like backstage, right? Um before anything else, it is like wind blows in that blows leaves and flowers across the floor. Again, you all are indoors. The Nexus is huge, but it's inside. Um, and there is like uh the light of the various nexuses is kind of like floating overhead that you're very much accustomed to. It almost looks like kind of the aurora borealis of these uh magical energies that are sort of coalescing. But this what you see is strange. You're not used to seeing leaves and flowers blowing over. And as you look over, the first thing you see is two elves, but they look like super elves. So, they're like seven foot. Um, they have very fine um features, sharp cheekbones, like longer than usual ears. One of them is wrapped in a cloak that looks like it's made out of flowers and the other one is wrapped in a cloak that looks like it's uh autumn leaves. Uh and when they walk it is almost more like they are gliding and when they sort of come forward they stop and look at you and they just say well blessings friends and Sofa like immediately just like bows to them. I bow and I put Leonus's head down to fall suit. &gt;&gt; I'm not bowing to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; I also bow because I just want don't want to be different. &gt;&gt; What's up? &gt;&gt; When you don't bow, you see Sanca like rotates his head and looks at you and then he stands up. He says, "These are the twin arch druids of Waldane. This is Landre in Failen. Uh they are here to speak for the kingdom of Waldane." And they both turn and look at you, um, Ran, and they say, "Apologies, Flynn. Have we offended you?" &gt;&gt; Uh, no. I just don't really do the whole bow thing. It's not really my thing. I'm more of like a like I I don't really respect you quite yet until I know you. So, &gt;&gt; he likes to chill and vibe first. &gt;&gt; I bowed because you are very tall and that is impressive. &gt;&gt; You are very wide. You are very impressive. a lovely suit there. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. There's the little turtles on my bow. &gt;&gt; It's You see like they they are as they get closer to you, you can see although one of them is male and one of them is female. They are clearly twins. Like they look very much alike. Uh and the male leans in and he goes, "A turtle bow tie. That is a great Where can I get one of those?" &gt;&gt; Oh, it's a it's there's a shop right near the Githoni brothel. He's never been there. &gt;&gt; Landre looks at you and she goes, "A gentleman? I would never frequent a brothel. Landre, it's a pleasure to meet you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Blessed for you dead. &gt;&gt; And they both turn and look at you, Leonus, and they go, "Cousin," and just kind of like both of them at the same time hold their arms out &gt;&gt; or reach out, hug them both in turn. You know these guys &gt;&gt; and you they they sort of even though again you're tall, you're still kind of like here to them and they kind of lean down and they say, "Have you made your way to Waldane? I know that you are a coastal elf, but the woods will embrace you like they embrace the rest of us. You're still an elf. &gt;&gt; I uh it's been a long time. It's been a long time. When I was younger, my my parents offered me the opportunity to leave and go go study abroad in Wald and I I learned a few things about the plane, but uh I haven't been in in many years. Now, this is one of those odd times that I've already made a mistake on things that I wrote and I made up. And so, I hit a crossroads where I was like, do I just lean into the mistake or do I just say that I made one? The princess is not from Waldane. She's from Tennela. Giving lots of words here that'll be important later. &gt;&gt; I could tell she was giving Tennela vibes. &gt;&gt; She's giving Tenna vibes, right? Like I mean, like she said, but she's just like Tenna. You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; She fit in like straight out of Tennel. You know what? did a Waldane. &gt;&gt; She's a Waldane eight, but she's like a 10 or a seven. &gt;&gt; She's She hasn't been to Waldane. I miss Waldane. &gt;&gt; So, the two of them uh glide off and after they leave, you feel it before you see it. the hairs on the back of your neck kind of start to stand up and you kind of get goosebumps a little where like there's like a a static charge in the air as you see one of the most beautiful beings you have ever seen in your life comes walking towards you. He's not super tall. He's only around 6 foot, but he has blue skin, like sky blue skin and bright white hair like clouds. He is wearing golden plate armor and he has a pair of wings. And Sanc Kofa looks at you and says, "This is High Saraphim Eleon from Ustu from the Kingdom of Heaven." Um, and he just gives him a very small nod like this before he gave the full like bow. He just gives him like one of these. And he walks up to all of you and he's like, "Friends, blessings of the one light upon all of you." &gt;&gt; One light. &gt;&gt; Asher, the one light. Yes. &gt;&gt; You say you think that Asher is the one light. &gt;&gt; Oh, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; That's funny. &gt;&gt; You see, you see, he turns and like rotates completely towards you and he's like, "Are you saying she isn't?" &gt;&gt; Oh, I I think &gt;&gt; Sofa is like he's saying, "Yes, &gt;&gt; don't mind Gorg. You have wonderful skin. Uh he turns and looks at you who are also blue and he says, "What a lovely shade." &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; And he stops and his eyes just like lock on you for a second and he says, "May I, friend?" &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; And he touches your shoulder. And when he does, Stone Beard, you kind of can't help start thinking about some of the battles. not all the bad ones, &gt;&gt; but just memories of fighting the demons. And he goes, "You um you seem so strong, but you carry so much. You don't have to maintain this burden. You know, you can turn it over to Asher. She will ease your heart and your soul." &gt;&gt; Many of us were born with positions to have soft hands like yours. Many of us were not. Have a blessed forge day. I &gt;&gt; Yeah, tell him stone bread. &gt;&gt; I moisturize extensively. &gt;&gt; More like Asera. &gt;&gt; And like right when he when you say this like you see it starts to like float up more and you see like his eyes start to brighten and SOA literally steps in front of you and he goes um hi Sarapim. Um forgive my very zealous friend. Uh he is quite pious in the worship of Horizon. He is often ignorant in his faith. But uh in the spirit of forging day, we all worship how we choose. Yes. He looks at you and you um and he just sort of like rubs his hands slightly and he says, "Well, perhaps there will be some opportunity in the future to correct your heretical assumptions." &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; Perhaps you could visit us too and I will tend to you personally. &gt;&gt; I'll tend to you personally if we you keep talking like that. &gt;&gt; You know what, bro? Okay. Um, right. Yeah. Um, thank you. Hi, Sarapim. Uh, and you see like he very much is looking at you as he's turning. &gt;&gt; No, keep going. &gt;&gt; Walking away. &gt;&gt; We're on an escort mission. &gt;&gt; And Sopha looks at you and he's like, &gt;&gt; "Can you guys can you guys do something about him? Are we &gt;&gt; What do you want me to say? &gt;&gt; Not that. There was a different god like Horizon. We know Horizon like we are all about Horizon in this group, right? Princess, &gt;&gt; you see she just jaw dropped wideeyed looking at him because again he's gorgeous. She's just like &gt;&gt; Princess, &gt;&gt; he's no chill as he's leaving. Like &gt;&gt; he's not that like I feel like I You guys think I look like a little bit better? &gt;&gt; No, even I thought he was pretty, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Even Stone Bread. He was so I bet Leonas liked him. &gt;&gt; He's I bet Leonas liked him, bro. You know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; I did like what he looked like. I did like that guy. &gt;&gt; I mean, Loan, no. You've got this like thing that quite frankly appeals to a certain demographic. I I I did just recently graduate from school and I guarantee you that would do a lot for them. But &gt;&gt; that is my demographic. &gt;&gt; He I mean, Leoness, he's &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh, look, I don't care how beautiful. I don't care how tall. I don't care how shaded pale blue skin they are. If they're talking about as as god or whatever, and it's not Verizon, the one true god, I'm going to have a problem with that. &gt;&gt; What are you not getting about don't be yourself? &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; those those were great notes. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; I fixed my bow tie. I understand the message and I'm a little bit sorry, but ultimately I'm still pissed. &gt;&gt; Important point of clarification because I don't know that we sit. Where is GJ during this? Oh, she's been chilling in my shell. She'll pop in, pop out. &gt;&gt; Perfect. Uh, another man comes walking up and where these other ones are like semi deific. They're like demigods walking in in their presence. You see what just looks like um a middle-aged man. He's got a beard. It's got kind of gray streaks through it. Salt and pepper. He's got raven black hair, which again just has shocks of it. Now he's got armor which you immediately recognize is the real thing. Dinged, scuffed from countless battles. He is holding a small hammer and a small anvil. Uh and he is barristen oaken shield from Tennela. Uh and he walks in and the first thing he does is look at you and he goes tennela's greatest hero. That's what they call you, right? Oak can shield, you son of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] And I dab them. Oh, they got a lot of fun. [Applause] &gt;&gt; They do the widest dab of all time. &gt;&gt; They do the warrior. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. That thing. That's the thing they do. &gt;&gt; You guys know each other. &gt;&gt; And he goes, "You haven't told them about the &gt;&gt; Do you know why it's forging day?" Sons of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that. &gt;&gt; No, you stop it. You know, let me tell you something. I was laying on a battlefield. Demon crossbow bolts in my guts. The skies opening up. I'm seeing the dragon Maracana. I think he's coming to take me. You know who drags me off the battlefield on his back? This son of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] here. &gt;&gt; There's nothing. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't be alive if not for him. &gt;&gt; That's crazy. You're so popular. &gt;&gt; A friend of Stone Beard's a friend of mine. It's nice to meet you. &gt;&gt; He also he tries to give you the warrior grip, but you sort of he's like, "Oh, that's No, it's No, you reached that. You haven't. You didn't show You didn't show him the &gt;&gt; Sorry, sir. He's not yet battle war. &gt;&gt; I start vibrating cuz I can't say Chadbeard, &gt;&gt; you know. Look, man. It's I'm like you guys. I'm just a old worn out fighter. I don't do this like politics and and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] But let me tell you something. If all we got to do is get together once a year and have a parade and it keeps young people like you alive, it's worth it, man. Just look at this outfit. Look at you. &gt;&gt; It's just a stupid The pink frills weren't me. There's a group of No, &gt;&gt; yeah, right. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Trunks. &gt;&gt; I'm just saying I look like a fighting man and you look like &gt;&gt; if I were to choose my attire, you know what I'd be wearing. &gt;&gt; You know, you guys, this is a beautiful thing. Gift Yonke sea elf to dead dude. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Working together though, right? Well, if you ever need to join a group, if you feel so inclined, &gt;&gt; so cool. &gt;&gt; They got me behind a desk pushing pencils. I'm commanding the army of Tennela, though. You know, you ever want to hang this up and just come home? You're out here fighting for everybody. Why don't you just fight for us, buddy? Could be like all times. Hey. Whoa, bro. This is We got a sort of crew going on. &gt;&gt; We do have a crew going. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Do they have a crew going on? &gt;&gt; I have a vow I have to uphold. It's not the crew that I would pick given my choice, but it's &gt;&gt; but it's the crew he loves. &gt;&gt; It's a waiting till marriage type thing for him. &gt;&gt; You You don't like Stone Bread, right? Oak and Shield. Like you you know, &gt;&gt; uh I know how it is. You bust each other's balls or whatever, but I'm telling you, you get into a pinch there's nobody better than this guy that you want that. Holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Is that Coots? &gt;&gt; You still got Coots. &gt;&gt; Of course. &gt;&gt; Coots. And you see he sort of like holds up the anvil and she kind of like hops onto it. You see he takes a little hammer. He just gives her a little ting ting ting. He's like I'm fixing boots. I'm fixing boots. And you see she's like rolls over and just goes. He's like she's all good. She's all fixed. And you see Sopha is just looking at him and looking at you guys and he goes, "Um, counselor, I believe you." And he goes, "Oh, oh yeah, the speech." Yeah, but um it's Look, man, let's let's &gt;&gt; if you'd like to meet at the bar later, we'll be there, too. We could talk about stories. You guys tell me all about the war stories you used to have. &gt;&gt; He's got this scar right here. You know, he probably told you something like he was like wrestling this demon down. That's not how he got this scar. &gt;&gt; Large demon. &gt;&gt; So, we were sneaking into the window of the co-ed dorm, right? And Soph's like, "Sir, excuse me. Um speech." Yeah. And he goes, "I'll tell you later." It was wild. Yeah, &gt;&gt; there's a demon in the co-endar. &gt;&gt; Oh, there was a demon in the coar. &gt;&gt; Don't you know? &gt;&gt; And you see he's like turns he's he's like always a gentleman though. &gt;&gt; Always a gentleman on the record. And he turns and uh leaves and and the princess turns and looks at you and she goes, "Those are also some of the stories that I've heard. I didn't think it was true. That is the scar. That is the &gt;&gt; Oh, you think I haven't lived many lives?" &gt;&gt; Just saying. That's respect. And while you all are talking, you hear a voice just come out of nowhere. All of you hear it. And she says, "That is fascinating that that is how you choose to interact with one another." &gt;&gt; We just hear that. &gt;&gt; You just hear it like you all hear it. Someone just like talks out loud. &gt;&gt; Who is talking to me? &gt;&gt; Oh, look at the weed. &gt;&gt; Forging day is not a day for disguises. Show yourself. Immediately right in front of you, you see a woman just appear. She was probably human once, but she is an odd mix of technological components in being very clearly dead. Her one human eye is kind of like sunken with a dark ring under it, but she's got like mechanical implants all across the other side of her face. in her arm is also mechanical but with like several attachments. It's almost like a multi-tool. It doesn't even come out to a hand anymore. Uh what you can see of her is wearing a very nice gown though. Uh and there's no attempt at all to hide her like pale flesh that is like basically coming out the other side. Um, and Sen Kofa looks at her and he says, "Uh, technommancer Zyra, um, from Mory." And she looks at all of you and goes, "I assume you knew I was from Mory, though, right?" &gt;&gt; Mory is where I'm from. &gt;&gt; Yes. The land of the dead. I I approach the technommancer this time trying not to make a social blunder like I've been doing and I adjust my bow tie and I say, "Why you got gears?" And she looks at you for a second and she looks at the arm and she goes, "Ah, apologies." And you see some of the like attachments and things begin to rotate and like form four fingers and a thumb. She just sort of like goes, "Is this better?" &gt;&gt; No, but I get it. I You're You seem cool. &gt;&gt; Is there Is there a world where I could like do a check to see if I like know her or &gt;&gt; You absolutely would know her. Um so the way this world works is the kingdoms do have their gods. There there is um Horizon, there is Asher, they everyone has them and the gods exist and interact, but they don't rule daytoday. So, all the kingdoms have people that are in charge. Um, and techn is one of the main leaders of Mory. You absolutely 100% would know who this is. &gt;&gt; She's gross. Rome &gt;&gt; door. I'm sorry. Sorry. Did you hear that? &gt;&gt; I hope your travels from Mory were safe. She looks at you and she says, "We are accustomed to reactions like this, but to us, the fact that you are warm and leaking." &gt;&gt; I know, right? Yes, &gt;&gt; it's kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] weird. &gt;&gt; You're not leaking anymore. I went to I went to the doctor. &gt;&gt; It is inefficient. the reason and she like holds the arm up to you and she says the reason why we are capable of such wonders in Mory is we're not distracted by needing to maintain a meat suit. We've achieved enlightenment. I lead in whisper. So it's a little bit of like a nationalist thing over in Mory like they don't really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with the whole like warm body type thing. Yeah. So just kind of let it be. She's like really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a big deal. &gt;&gt; She's a big deal. &gt;&gt; She's a big deal. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, you may say that you don't maintain warm body sack. Have you ever had slop? &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry for him. Uh he's into slop. I remember slop. Yes. &gt;&gt; And she looks at you for a second and she looks at Coots and she says, "Magnificent. Is this your engineering?" &gt;&gt; Of course. Built myself. She looks at some of your other tools in Autramra and she says, "You are quite gifted. &gt;&gt; It's not a gift. It's earned every day." &gt;&gt; The time may come that you also could be blessed with the gift of eternity. Imagine having centuries to perfect your craft. &gt;&gt; I'll leave that curse to you and my &gt;&gt; It's not a curse to us. It is a blessing. Think about it. How much of this? And she motions at all the crowd. How much of everything they do is inspired by the fear of death, of running out of time, of not being able to do the things you wanted to achieve the heights that you wanted. We are free from this. &gt;&gt; She's spitting. &gt;&gt; I feel oddly enticed by this speech. &gt;&gt; Leonus, you have seen the creeping knight, the god of Mory. He was the first one to appear to you. Uh, so you've seen him. Uh, she doesn't know that you've seen him, but you know that you've seen him. &gt;&gt; Technommancer Zyra, I understand why you and Mory enjoy your eternities, but I find that progress comes from death. And so I will gladly accept it when it comes. &gt;&gt; Oh, he's talking about death again like he knows stuff. &gt;&gt; He would know more about death. R knows. &gt;&gt; I've seen a lot of it in war. She pushes her hair back and she says, "The one advantage that we have in Mory, well, one of our many advantages we have in Mory is we are not in a rush." Stone Beard, I hope you have a long and fruitful life. I hope all of you get to a great advanced age having done everything you ever wished in your heart. And perhaps when that day comes, you can be blessed to join us. &gt;&gt; And I hope you have a good forging day. Carry on. &gt;&gt; In You see, she looks at Coots one more second and you see her hand rotates and like a little piece of parchment like flips up and a little pen comes up and starts writing something on the parchment. And she pulls it out with the biological hand and it's small, you know, like a post-it note size. She says you can increase her pressure efficiency by 34% if you make these modifications. &gt;&gt; It's it's super right, Stone Beard. Like it's super right. &gt;&gt; Cool. &gt;&gt; Until next time. And she says, um, Ran, one thing. &gt;&gt; Remember, you're not just a reflection on Clan Kaladus. You're a reflection on all of us. The living distrust us. They look down on us. We should try to get along. &gt;&gt; If you say it's important, I'll make it more important to me. &gt;&gt; Not with [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the turtle. I won't respect the turtle. &gt;&gt; And she like looks at him and she says, "We don't have many turtles where we are." &gt;&gt; Yeah, because we live super long already. She stops and she like sort of scratches her head and you actually hear like a metallic kind of creaking and she says, &gt;&gt; "Well, it's more like when you die, there tends to be not enough left of you to reanimate." And turns and walks away. &gt;&gt; That's chilling. I don't like her. &gt;&gt; Last but certainly not least, you all hear an argument like, "Get out of the way. You get out of the way." Like people want to see a real pirate. Like look, I have been running rings around your sorry ass for the last 10 years. I don't even know why they invited both of us because they didn't think you'd show up. And you see two people come around the corner who very clearly are from Leo, the kingdom of the pirates, where Gorg and uh Leonus hail from. They are in their captain finery, but you immediately recognize Captain Allar Stormchaser and Rook Tidewater. Two of the most notorious pirates from Leo actually uh actively like elbowing and pushing each other. &gt;&gt; So me and Ron or me and Leonus, upon seeing this, we yell pirate fight and we'll do it on three. One, two, three, pirate fight. And you see both of them pull out a a rapier and a pistol and like look around and they're like &gt;&gt; ah you guys [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; You guys, you know, and they come and they do actually dab you up like properly there, you know, and like bro, you've been working out like look at look &gt;&gt; swimming a lot. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; swimming. Get my laughs in. Uh, and leans over and she's like, "Look, man. I got brought in to speak for Leo. I don't know how this sorry son of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] must have like uh intercepted the communication." And Rook is like, "Yep." And he pulls out a scroll. He's like, "See what's that say?" Rook Tidewater. Rook Tidewater. Right there. &gt;&gt; Right there. Right there. &gt;&gt; He's like, "They misspelled it because my name's Rude Tide Walker." Whatever. That's not important. You know, but that's proof I didn't forge it because they spell my name wrong. Look at the size of this guy, buddy. &gt;&gt; Rook Tidewater. I've heard of your uh thieveries. &gt;&gt; Okay, first of all, it's not stealing if they're not using it. Right. &gt;&gt; I' I've always said that. &gt;&gt; Right. You know, I've always said that &gt;&gt; you're has a poor moral compass, but it's comforting to see someone from the homeland. &gt;&gt; All looks at you and she goes, "See, that is a common misconception that pirates are just stealing stuff all the time. Like, we like do other stuff. We like protect people. Who keeps the coast safe from the demons coming back? Huh? Us. &gt;&gt; It's a pleasure to see you both. &gt;&gt; And you What's up, dude? Hey, what's up? How you doing? I'm &gt;&gt; doing all right. How are you doing? &gt;&gt; You want to go? I mean, you ever been on a real pirate ship? &gt;&gt; No. And although Ran is objectively dead, like there is like a little red comes to his cheeks and she goes like, I mean, you know, maybe like after this is all over, I take you for a little ride. &gt;&gt; It's fun. It's a fun It's like fun. &gt;&gt; You're total blocking. You're torto blocking. &gt;&gt; You guys are cool. &gt;&gt; You could come by anytime. Like we literally got all these teleportals, you know, like come back. &gt;&gt; Okay, we're busy, man. This is my crew. We're with the crew. me and Leonus. I mean, our crew, the crew, collective crew, you know, and Rook's like, "All right, I'm going to go talk before she embarrasses all of us." And she goes, "You son of a" and like they literally look at each other for a second and like take off running towards the podium, like trying to like push at each other to to get up there. And after they're gone, Sanca looks at you and he goes, "Okay, all right. Well, that went well, right?" York embarrassed us a few times, but I think it went great. &gt;&gt; While you're standing there, uh, Princess Selenia looks up at all of you and she goes, "This is an even better day than I hoped for." And then you hear an explosion start going off all over the place. And that is a good place for us to stop. &gt;&gt; Rotten damn princess.
