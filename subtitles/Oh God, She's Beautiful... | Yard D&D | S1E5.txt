 I would like to pick them up and walk them to the portal and throw them in. &gt;&gt; And they're gone. We've been instructed to bring you all to our lady. Or if you don't want to cooperate, we can have fifth cuffs here. &gt;&gt; We'll go, but we're leading. &gt;&gt; Selenia looks at you and her eyes turn purple. There's still time. Can we talk? &gt;&gt; You want us to turn on who raised us? &gt;&gt; She's fighting me and your ex starts to rattle. Hello and welcome to the yard D and D episode five. So you all have been in pursuit of the kidnapped princess Selenia uh who was taken away from the forging day festival in the Nexus your headquarters as the Pterodin uh infiltrated. Every time I'm about to say penetrated and I know you'll laugh and then in my head like if you say I always hesitate because I make penetrated infiltrated &gt;&gt; things get penetrated all the time &gt;&gt; and you end up in dudes. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh Cokehead seems to have possessed the body of Princess Selenia and is holding her at knife point. And when Leonus said, "What is it that you're not telling us?" Her hand began to tremble and she looked down and said, "She's fighting me. That's adorable." and Stone Beard's acts of warning begin to ring. In that moment, Ron, at the back of the group of these mindless hordes that somewhat are between you and your friends, actually, um, who were facing Coke Strea in the princess's body and Minkx and Rampart who have sort of spread out to the sides and 50 zombies. &gt;&gt; You said Rampart, not barricade. That's funny cuz it's a synonym. &gt;&gt; Barricade. You know, it's &gt;&gt; that's funny. &gt;&gt; Full disclosure, I wanted to name the dude Rampart, but there's a Rampart in the Bad Batch, so I'm like, I can't call him Rampart. I'll call him Barricade. That's where the name came from. &gt;&gt; And then my brain wants him to be Rampart. &gt;&gt; That's makes more sense. Yeah, that's that where it came from. But his name is Barricade. Barricade. &gt;&gt; Cool name. I wish I picked that name. Um, Ran, while you are looking at this, everything stops. The only thing you can hear is the breeze on the wind, but even the sort of ambient shuffling of the zombies stops. The voices of your friends stops everything. And you hear what is becoming a familiar, heavy footfall coming up behind you. And you feel that he's right behind you before you even see him. And he says, "Wrong, Catus. What's the difference between smoking a cigarette and going down on your partner?" Crass. um a disembodied voice behind me that I I don't want to believe is real or behind me for real. Um I don't know what is the difference. You see the creeping knight walk up next to you, towering, armored, menacing. His burned face is objectively horrible uh with his burning red eyes, but he is literally your god. And in that his presence is comforting to you. uh that you know, no matter how terrible he looks, he actually is pretty chill. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he sort of takes a step forward and he looks at some of these mindless zombies here and he says, "The taste changes when you get to the butt." &gt;&gt; That is my god. He sort of leans down and he looks at some of these zombies very disapprovingly and he goes, We work long and hard to build up the reputation of my to make sure the shortlived ones see us more than just mindless beasts and then one of these dumb bastards will shambble into a village and eat a baby or something and then it's our problem. &gt;&gt; You can't eat a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] baby in this country anymore apparently. Well, we not supposed to let them know when we do the baby eating. But listen, all of these mindless [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are literally bad for business. We going to have to do something about that, don't you think? &gt;&gt; Well, you want to take them all out? &gt;&gt; And you see, he walks, but when he walks, he just moves through them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. kind of walking up behind your friends who are just frozen. And he says, "No need to say anything to them this time, but this one." And he points at Coette. This one's interesting. She's not one of our, but I think she's on to something. She could be useful. Now, I'd never asked you to mislead your friend, such as it is, but maybe you could use that big brain of yours to get a little closer to her before uh this sequence of events is about to go where it goes. You understand? Maybe be a uh a little bit of a double agent. No, no, no, no, no. I'm not one of those other stuffy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] God's wrong. I want you to do what you choose to do. Don't do it cuz I ask you to, sir. &gt;&gt; See, I was trying to I was kind of trying to avoid the uh the blame for all this. Hoping I could put that on you later. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; accountability is kind not really my thing. Man, listen. Whenever you get into some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you always can be like, "I did it cuz the creeping night made me." Of course. &gt;&gt; Okay. As long as we agree on that. &gt;&gt; No, I'll I'll take all of those for you off my shoulders. Of course. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I would love to betray them. That I would I'll do that. &gt;&gt; The greater good. We just need to get some insight into right &gt;&gt; what she's doing and what she knows. She's not going to tell everything. Who would? She's not a dummy. But uh and he comes and he stands next to you and he says, "I think it's time for at least a minor demonstration of the true power of undeath. Don't you think?" &gt;&gt; So without saying anything, I think I uh turn undead here. &gt;&gt; Perfect. When he says that and he sees the look in your eyes, he just walks past you just out of the building and you sort of hear his footfalls sort of like fade off into the distance. So, turn undead is an ability that we've not used yet, which you as a grave cleric have the ability to do where you can terrify undead, lesser undead, and make them flee away from you. Uh when you get a little stronger, you can destroy them outright, but at this exact second, you can't do that yet. So, it is almost like time begins moving again. She's holding the knife, looking at it. The axe starts to rattle. What does it look like when Ran terrifies these undead hordes? &gt;&gt; So, so my skin is already pretty gaunt, but it gets even colder and you can see like a wave of uh like chilling cold skin, like blue skin covers my whole body. My eyes start to glow white and uh my hair sort of stands up a little bit more. Not like that like like zapped by lightning, but like almost floating in water. Although you three are not undead, it is unmistakable feeling this like wave of menace wash through the room and you see these undead or I don't think three is going to be enough to resist you. &gt;&gt; Okay. Is that easy? And their ranks just break and they begin sort of fleeing in all directions because they're kind of mindless. Some of them running out of the building, some of them just as far as the fortress will get. And you even see as it's coming both uh Minkx and Barricade turn and look right at you and go and you see their vampire fangs come down. And Coette standing there, the wave hits her and you all see driven out of the princess, what looks like a purplish outline of a woman made just out of energy. And she just sort of looks down at her hands as the princess collapses to the floor. And she looks up and she just looks at you and you see it swirl and sort of fly back towards the back of the room. And a moment later, another pair of eyes opens in an el cove. Purple. She goes, "Surely you must have known I'd have a spare. All you roll initiative." &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; 14. 16. &gt;&gt; 16. Uh, what is that? That's &gt;&gt; 21. &gt;&gt; Taiwan. &gt;&gt; 21 for Rome. &gt;&gt; Seven. &gt;&gt; Close. The the true fighter waits and observes before striking. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; you're not going last. You're going first in the second round. Uh Gorg, &gt;&gt; uh 14. &gt;&gt; All right. Uh it is very fitting that you would go first here is you were the one that knew that this was about to happen as these terrified zombie hordes are fleeing. Uh and you clearly have these other two vampires. Um, at the far side of the room, you see what now is apparently a third coette. She is tall and pale with sunken cheeks and like black ringed eyes in the glowing purple, but she has what looks almost like a funeral veil over her eyes, though. You still see the glow slightly behind it. &gt;&gt; Badass. &gt;&gt; Uh, black lipstick. And you see her fangs. and she has a form-fitting black gown who comes forward and she says, "I would like the record to show, Stone Beard. We did not start the hostilities, but it is your turn, Ron. &gt;&gt; Wait, my hit." &gt;&gt; And you see Minkx just says, "I did I I I Yes. and he looks at you and he's kind of like wildeyed and fearful now, but walks right up to you and he says, "You can have the one." Yes. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Stone Beard pulls out an iPad. A steel chair. Oh my god. Stone Beard with a steel chair. &gt;&gt; The turnbuckle. &gt;&gt; So, I just roll damage then. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, theoretically, you still need to roll to attack him. He said he'd just stand there. Doesn't mean it could still go wrong. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you could miss your free shot. &gt;&gt; No pressure. Just cuz everybody's looking at you, it's fine. &gt;&gt; It's a 12. &gt;&gt; Uh, was it your intent to hit him with your fist or with your weapon? &gt;&gt; With my weapon, my great axe of warning. &gt;&gt; You. And he just looks down at it and he says, "I understand why you wanted that free hit as it seems like it does not even break his skin." &gt;&gt; That was one. &gt;&gt; Oh, Thimble. He's just so off today. He's not He's I I just You know, okay. Like, and before I thought he was holding back because he like wanted everybody else to feel like they were cool. Like he wanted you to &gt;&gt; Wait, but &gt;&gt; I'm raged. I get two. &gt;&gt; You're not raged yet, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm not raged from the previous battle. And &gt;&gt; last a minute, &gt;&gt; Ron. You lost your friend. And he does hit him and he doesn't move. &gt;&gt; Heavy rage all the time. It's kind of like next time I won't hold back. &gt;&gt; He looks very nonvascular right now. If I move closer to Stone Beard, does the uh the monster have to move away cuz I'm undead. &gt;&gt; No, the the the fear effect is gone off. Everybody who's scared is scared. &gt;&gt; Okay. Um so it's my turn. &gt;&gt; It is your turn. &gt;&gt; Um &gt;&gt; instead of having 53 enemies, you've got three. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; he's really weak. &gt;&gt; Uh I'm going to attack the I'm going to use my guiding bolt on the one closest to Stone. &gt;&gt; That's Minkx. &gt;&gt; Perfect. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] snake. M on minks. &gt;&gt; So you can roll to attack &gt;&gt; uh nat 20 &gt;&gt; plus four 24 &gt;&gt; more than enough. So you roll double damage. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; You can roll twice as many dice. You can roll it and double it. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Am I doing this right? &gt;&gt; Probably in that 31. &gt;&gt; I I love this. You hit him and it's just nothing. And he's just like, &gt;&gt; you know, normally I would give you another just &gt;&gt; I'm just wait like blows his hair over. Like you see like the burn on his face from the radiant energy. &gt;&gt; Oh, Ran to Ran bailed Stone Beard out. &gt;&gt; That's crazy. &gt;&gt; Okay, I'm usually like the funny one. We all know that here. These guys are no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] joke. Like suit up. And you see as he takes this shot in the face and he's just like looking at you and he goes, "Excuse me." And like very much looks at you. Uh but anything else that is just your accent? You bonus action move anything? &gt;&gt; Bonus action. Bonus action. I uh where where's that where's that one in space? &gt;&gt; You could give uh inspiration to someone else. &gt;&gt; Oh, who's second? &gt;&gt; Uh the next person is going to be Leonus. &gt;&gt; I'm going to give inspiration to Leonus. Uh, which means you have a D6 to basically use when you want to. Uh, what do you say to inspire Leonus? &gt;&gt; Look, we should fix the thing where it's weird when it's just us two in the room. &gt;&gt; You're making eye contact with me right now &gt;&gt; cuz right I feel like it's we're both thinking about it a lot and if we could just get past that. &gt;&gt; Oh my god, he gave you inspiration. &gt;&gt; Don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tell. Don't make this a thing. &gt;&gt; Ran usually makes fun of me all the time. &gt;&gt; Be so nice to you. I feel like &gt;&gt; shut up. Shut up. &gt;&gt; That was really cool what he did, too. &gt;&gt; Just Just do something. Do something. &gt;&gt; Thimble is normally invisible, but you very much see him next to Leon. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; Evil [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Grimace is here &gt;&gt; still. If you could just do maybe hit her. &gt;&gt; I'm going to do it. &gt;&gt; So you have Coette Streak at the far side of the room, say ft cuz she had to to fly and get her hold out corpse. Uh you have in the center of your room in the room is you all uh sort of surrounded by Minkx and Barricade kind of to your left and right although Minx is basically right next to Stone Beard. Actually, you just sort of shot from where you were. So I'm going to say about 15 feet back uh is Ran who has just dispersed hordes of undead and then just absolutely blasted Minkx. So you know Ron's looking pretty cool right now. Leonus, &gt;&gt; he's going beast. &gt;&gt; Yeah, but it's your turn. &gt;&gt; Ron's got me amped right now. So, I am going to use Hunter's Mark on Minkx. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; There's sort of a I take a moment. It usually comes uh like from from my chest. I have to kind of like pump myself up and then and then shoot it outwards with uh with my hands. The hunter's mark uh travels across the room to mark Minkx. And uh I now get to do extra damage and I think I still get to &gt;&gt; You will know where he is if he leaves. Let's just stack attacks on uh I'll lead the charge. I can hunters mark whoever we want to stack attacks on and uh just go one at a time. &gt;&gt; The whole talking thing. &gt;&gt; You do know that we can hear. &gt;&gt; We need more. We need more battling. &gt;&gt; Like you can't just say I'm laying the plan out. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So my eyes start. &gt;&gt; You're like a James Bond villain. Got me amp. &gt;&gt; You're laying it. &gt;&gt; I feel like making a plan. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I whispered to thimble cuz Stone Beard's not making any plans right now. &gt;&gt; You know what? Someone's making plans. That's like This is such a hard carry. &gt;&gt; Ran, do something. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. Um win. &gt;&gt; I add the D6 to my my roll on. &gt;&gt; You can roll and see how it goes and then decide like you just have it. It's like you have just like a bonus in your back pocket in case something goes wrong. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's serious now. The guns are out. &gt;&gt; It's a six. &gt;&gt; So maybe we Oh, but plus my 10. So 16. &gt;&gt; Uh 16 will be enough to hit him. &gt;&gt; Okay. And then we do &gt;&gt; plus 10. &gt;&gt; You really got to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it to not hit. Um, do I get to attack twice? &gt;&gt; Um, should I do &gt;&gt; give me Yeah, give me the attacks cuz I'm going to find out what Gorg's going to do. You give me the damage separate. &gt;&gt; Oh. Uh, 25. &gt;&gt; Uh, also going to be more than enough. So, just give me the damage when you got it, but remember to add the hunter mark to both shots. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, one, &gt;&gt; uh, in the meantime, give him when you got it. Yorg. Uh, everybody's blasting MX. Apparently, Coette is looking menacing at the other side of the room. Uh, nobody's done anything to barricade. &gt;&gt; So, what some people don't &gt;&gt; And there's hordes of zombies that are actively trying to get away from Rome. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What a lot of people don't remember about me, Gorg, is that I'm a paladin. Okay. And undead, they're kind of my bread and butter. I do extra damage to them. &gt;&gt; You absolutely do. &gt;&gt; And I'm saying this out loud so everyone knows it down there. Hello, Co. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm saying. Communication. Mhm. Cuz that's my guy. &gt;&gt; No, but you're just like giving everything away like like we're aware. &gt;&gt; But when I hit you with my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] trident, it's not going to matter what I said or did beforehand. &gt;&gt; That has worked so well up until now. &gt;&gt; I am charging Coette. I'm not listening to to Leonus. I don't care about Hunter Mark. I believe I can oneshot her with everything I got. &gt;&gt; You see, she just holds her hands out like this when you come running forward &gt;&gt; because you guys forget about something. It's something called Horizon. Okay. My beautiful big breasted tortal god that I can't see in my mind typically, but I did see once. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's not at all. &gt;&gt; Right. We're all talking a lot. &gt;&gt; Uh, we're f You guys realize we're &gt;&gt; I'm doing a speech. I'm doing a speech cuz I am going to one-shot her and I want her to know that. &gt;&gt; I just said I was skipping my villainous monologue, but this is like a heroic monologue. I don't &gt;&gt; I roll my damage. I queue up two thunderous arrows at the same time because I'm feeling a little feisty from ran and I fire them both off at Banks. I do 29 damage. He goes from sassing you to like boom bam boom like pretty quick like looking down and you can see his like undead flesh with the holes in it and he's like but he is still up. &gt;&gt; Damn. &gt;&gt; So I see that and I'm like maybe she's a lot stronger than I thought. &gt;&gt; She literally killed you all this morning. though &gt;&gt; I have I've turned my focus to minkx and I also uh right before I roll I do this motion which is to indicate that like a small penis &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; I'm &gt;&gt; it's zero &gt;&gt; oh wait no plus six I was about to say plus zero &gt;&gt; um yes that is enough to hit him and give me the second attack &gt;&gt; nine &gt;&gt; uh nine is not going to be enough. Uh so as you come and you hit him with the first one, when you swing to hit him with the second one, you see he basically explodes in just a cloud of vapor &gt;&gt; and the sword go and it like reconstitutes right in front of you. Yeah, &gt;&gt; but do give me the damage for the first one. You got it. Are you going to smite him? &gt;&gt; Uh I am. &gt;&gt; You only have so many spell slots and you still got to fight coat. &gt;&gt; I'm going to save smite. I'm not going to &gt;&gt; say that for Kat. &gt;&gt; Perfect. Just give give me the damage when you got it. Uh, it is, however, Kat's turn. &gt;&gt; Uh, and she looks up and she says, "Well, I had hoped that we would be able to cooperate. Instead, I shall simply have to settle for reanimating your bodies." And you see, the chain lightning gets ready to come out again. the chain lightning that she killed you with last time. But this time, something different happens on the ground. Princess Selenia is laying there and she goes and you see the chain lightning just fizzles out and Coette looks down at her hands and she sits up and you see her blonde hair has black streaks through it and the pupils of her eyes have turned purple but not her whole eyes. And she has very small vampire fangs. She goes, "Huh? Hey, hey." And she starts to stand up. She goes, and you see over her hands like this like shadowy energy is kind of beginning to play over her fingers. And she goes, "Guys, guys, what is this?" &gt;&gt; Can any of us make like a knowledge like a knowledge or history check to like &gt;&gt; Morakana? I won't even make you roll. It's just as Coette was taking over her body, she apparently got some of her power. &gt;&gt; Oh. &gt;&gt; Oh, sorry. I thought you were talking about Coette. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I thought so, too. But this is the princess. The princess. &gt;&gt; Oh, that makes so much more sense. I was like, I thought Kat was talking like I don't know. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tell me, bro. &gt;&gt; Nope. The princess is like gotten some of her power. &gt;&gt; Damn. Okay. Hey, are you princess? Are you in there? &gt;&gt; Do you feel evil right now or good? &gt;&gt; No. I feel great. &gt;&gt; You feel good? Do you feel malice toward everything? &gt;&gt; Do you like us still? Yeah, I only feel malice towards her and that's great. &gt;&gt; That's good. I love that. That is good. &gt;&gt; You're beautiful &gt;&gt; in dude. You see, Coette just sort of looks at her and she says, "Huh, a little dump here. That's adorable." However, because she got counterpelled, that is it for her. So, Stone Beard, it is your turn. &gt;&gt; Wait, I did damage. I did damage. Oh, yes. Give me the damage. So, I accidentally rolled a bunch of d8s. I'm just going to take the lowest one. Uh, so it's it's one plus &gt;&gt; a d6 plus three. So, it's six plus four total 10 damage. &gt;&gt; Perfect. &gt;&gt; On Minkx. &gt;&gt; Uh, &gt;&gt; please tell me Minkx dies. &gt;&gt; No, he's still up. He's beat up and he's on his feet. &gt;&gt; My saucy little Minkx. &gt;&gt; Mhm. You can do this all day, you know. Uh, Stone Beard, it is your turn. &gt;&gt; Good man. &gt;&gt; Princess Selenia is getting to her feet. &gt;&gt; Go, I understand why you do this, but to force the undead to fight on your behalf, when do they find peace? Is respecting the dead truly gripping onto them like sands in a beach? And then I go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rage mode. My nipples burst out of my shirt. &gt;&gt; Is it? &gt;&gt; Tell me, go kid. Is it? We all smell the liquor now. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; dude. Have you been drinking more? &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; You see, she just looks at you and she says, "When do any of us get to find peace?" And like you see her fang sort of like slide down longer. &gt;&gt; Spend enough time with me and you'll find out. And then I take a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] swipe at good old Minkx. Go for it. &gt;&gt; I'm attacking recklessly as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Perfect. &gt;&gt; I rolled 22 is my high. &gt;&gt; That is enough. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. And then I hit him with that damage. &gt;&gt; It's just a one damage roll. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh, yes. &gt;&gt; And I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like, you see my X and I swipe and it and and everybody quiets down cuz this looks bad. I do I do like a shot put. I do a double swing and then I strike down. I'm a little too far back. I realize &gt;&gt; I'm a little too far back, but I fall through anyway and it just leaves a slice across a flesh wound. It does four damage, &gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; He just like looks down. You see, he touches it and he goes, &gt;&gt; "Well struck." &gt;&gt; Freaky bonus action. &gt;&gt; So, my action was &gt;&gt; lead the attack. &gt;&gt; The attack. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. And then you raged. So, that that was your bonus action. &gt;&gt; So, I don't think I have Do I have anything else? &gt;&gt; Nope. That's it. &gt;&gt; I don't run out of dick. He's he is standing there in front of you uh grievously injured by the two of you and he just sort of looks back and forth and he says and as he's standing there in front of you, you see the wounds start to heal and he says, "You all were nearly there actually." Um fascinating. He doesn't heal 100%, but you like clearly see some of some of the injuries start to close up on him. &gt;&gt; God damn it. &gt;&gt; And he says, &gt;&gt; "I know you think you are the proud leader that you would sacrifice anything for your companions, but to me, you're merely an inconvenience. It is he who has to die." Uh, what is your AC? Uh, my armor class. &gt;&gt; I should have smited. I'm so sorry. &gt;&gt; I think it's 16. I remember it. Top left. &gt;&gt; Fine. &gt;&gt; 16. &gt;&gt; You see Minkx goes crawling along the wall like a &gt;&gt; to leave my area without &gt;&gt; an attack of opportunity. You can't roll to see if you can hit him as he's leaving. &gt;&gt; You got to go through me first. &gt;&gt; 20. Nah. A dirty though. &gt;&gt; Uh, that is enough to hit him. &gt;&gt; Filthy 20. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Give him a spank while he walks away. And as he walks away, I flip my axe to the dull side and I hit him in the ass and I and it's and it's a powerful hit. It hits him for six. &gt;&gt; You make a weirdass noise and when he goes over to Rone, he he like he looks bad doing it. &gt;&gt; It's like he's got sandals on. &gt;&gt; I didn't mean to let that out. Uh, Ron. Uh, that is a 16 on the die, which is going to be enough. Uh, you see, he comes with his claw and grabs you by the shoulder for eight points of damage, but unfortunately with a natural 20, he he grabs you for a second and he says, "So, you're the master of the undead, right? and bites into ran. Can &gt;&gt; I can I react with cutting words? &gt;&gt; What you can do is you have an ability as a grave cleric where you can just cancel out criticals. Uh so where he is going to very much be coming for your jugular. You can make it just a normal hit instead. &gt;&gt; Let's do that. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it. &gt;&gt; Uh what does it look like when like he very much is headed for the jugular? like you like Fang's distended like jaw open a little too wide. &gt;&gt; Uh time for me at least kind of slows down for a moment right before he bites. Not slow enough for me to like really change it. But uh all the veins in my body sort of rearrange so that he just slightly misses. &gt;&gt; And as he bites down, this is already happened. I yell out, "Rone, watch out." And I'm like, "Too late. Way too late." And I am thinking about you being in the guy earlier and then this happening and I'm just I'm just putting stuff together in my mind. &gt;&gt; Oh, this sucks. Don't lose your tongue. &gt;&gt; And I'm like it's like ran shouldn't be suck. &gt;&gt; You see the fangs just very much sink in and it's like &gt;&gt; supposed to be a jugular thing. &gt;&gt; Whoops. All meat. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um but it is going to do some damage. is going to do six piercing and seven necrotic. &gt;&gt; Wait, how do I count? Is it just all the same? &gt;&gt; Yeah, 13. I give it to you different cuz you might have like resistances or something. &gt;&gt; However, what you do see even though he bites onto you, your hit point maximum goes down by seven. And you see his wounds start to heal. Like he's like taking some of the life out of you. &gt;&gt; Oh, he's sucking you dry. He's sucking you down to the bone. &gt;&gt; Sucking you down to the bone. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Don't ignore the tip. &gt;&gt; It's all right. &gt;&gt; While he's doing this and you all sort of like look and see this is what's happening. Barricade just says, "Oh, scared now. Delicious." And he sort of looks and he goes, "I think it's time for some tortal soup." &gt;&gt; I hate when people say that. It's messed up. He rushes over and is going to claw you, Gorg, for eight slashing. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; I brace. Wait, does it matter my armor class? &gt;&gt; Well, I I know what your armor class is. &gt;&gt; I brace. &gt;&gt; He brace successful. &gt;&gt; You're like, &gt;&gt; yeah. Uh, and he also sinks his fangs into you, Gorg, for six piercing and seven necrotic. &gt;&gt; He doesn't have a lot of issues. one. &gt;&gt; Oh my god, &gt;&gt; that heel was clutch back then. &gt;&gt; Oh dear. E, I can't believe you like this, Ran. E, this sucks. &gt;&gt; Right next to you, &gt;&gt; biting into your neck, and you feel fear &gt;&gt; coming off of GJ. &gt;&gt; And right next to you, he says, "Don't worry. I'll take good care of her." &gt;&gt; Oh, dude. Uh &gt;&gt; uh &gt;&gt; you're weird. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you guys realize that Gorg is in pretty bad shape. Just because I will say for no reason in particular, I just kind of want to say out loud, if it drops you to zero, you will die. You will not go to death saves. &gt;&gt; You so bad &gt;&gt; bypass straight into being no longer alive. &gt;&gt; Why is that? Do we know that? &gt;&gt; I say you know that. &gt;&gt; This sucks so bad. At least I'll have a death save. Yeah. Yeah. You'll be fine, man. Don't worry. Just &gt;&gt; stone beard. &gt;&gt; It's just a coin flip. It's fine. &gt;&gt; They're healing. &gt;&gt; Our friends don't look so good. &gt;&gt; Maybe we should leave. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Maybe we should try to escape. &gt;&gt; Oh, I can hear that. That's crazy, dude. &gt;&gt; Leonus, you know, you are the only one of our group who has managed to save all of us. If you leave, we're surely done for. Now, I won't. &gt;&gt; I won't leave you behind here, but we might have to leave together. Oh, while you all are talking, you see Princess Selenia looks down and in her and she's sort of like playing with this darkness and a sword forms in her hand and she says, "Um, Stone Beard." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. What up, &gt;&gt; uh, &gt;&gt; oh, damn. &gt;&gt; Uh, &gt;&gt; where'd you get that? &gt;&gt; I just I I thought about I was like, "Oh, I wonder if I could stab somebody with these shadows and and here it is." Um, should do you want me to help him? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, if &gt;&gt; what do you want me to help? Because I mean I think that guy looks pretty weak. Like I think I can I can take that guy. &gt;&gt; She's pointing at Ms. Barricade doesn't have a scratch on him. &gt;&gt; As much as this sucks and I don't uh you should probably help him. That's a great ran between us. &gt;&gt; Yeah, help Ran. He's more important in this fight. &gt;&gt; Yeah, a ran. Got it. Um and she comes over uh and you see she reaches in her belt and she pulls out just a little dagger which you knew she had. I mean most proper ladies would have. Uh, and she very much is just walking towards um, uh, you said to to help him. Walking towards me. &gt;&gt; I'm at one HP and she starts walking towards me and I'm embarrassed cuz I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] my shell. &gt;&gt; She goes she's like, I don't I don't know what that Okay. Um, &gt;&gt; don't worry about it. You should help her own. &gt;&gt; She walks up to Minx and she goes, "Let him go." And Minkx just sort of, &gt;&gt; I'm going to need more than that, princess. And she goes, "Oh, oh, well, they told me that I'm always supposed to try diplomacy before." No, no, &gt;&gt; a move some sort of Okay, please. &gt;&gt; And she holds the dagger back and it erupts into green flames. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good. I like that. &gt;&gt; Okay. Um and and you see he hisses and then she goes and goes forward with the shadow blade uh in stabs right through his chest. She goes and he slumps to the ground. &gt;&gt; Let's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] go. &gt;&gt; Oh, I definitely hated that. Good job. &gt;&gt; It's okay if you like that. &gt;&gt; Guys, give it over for the princess. &gt;&gt; You look so good with that sword. &gt;&gt; She goes She goes, I super did why you guys do this. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; This the shadowy blade remains in her hand, but it's like the dagger erupts into green flames and she hits him and then like the flames go out. Like she's just holding the holding the dagger. Uh, but that does bring us back around to the top with you, Ran. Minkx is dead. Barricade is actively killing Gorg. Uh, and Coette is unharmed. &gt;&gt; Can I use uh Path to the Grave? &gt;&gt; Um, yes. Path to the Grave will make them do double damage on a hit, but they'll take double damage on the next hit. So, probably what you're going to want to do is hold, let Leonus go before you, then mark him with the path to the grave and Gorg can hit him. &gt;&gt; I don't know. What do you guys think? Should I do that? &gt;&gt; I'm so powerful, dude. I can smite. I do extra damage. I'm dead. &gt;&gt; I trust you. &gt;&gt; I trust your judgment, bro. &gt;&gt; What I would say, just strategically, it's probably better let Leonus go first. Let Leonus soften this vampire up, then you path to the grave and let him try and kill it. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Probably the best thing tactically. &gt;&gt; So, I'm holding my turn. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And you go. &gt;&gt; Yeah. To attack the barricade. All right. Uh I'm going to use uh Hunter's Mark again. &gt;&gt; You actually don't have to cast it again. You can move it. You can you can keep it going. &gt;&gt; From the dead. Oh, I can just move it from &gt;&gt; Yeah, it does take your bonus action, but it does not take another spell slot. &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. Um &gt;&gt; because you pretty much know where that corpse is. It's right there. So, you can move it to the next guy. Uh, so I Yeah, I I start I just like transfer quickly. Transfer move. You can do it onehanded when you're just transferring. &gt;&gt; So cool. &gt;&gt; Uh, flip it over to barricade. &gt;&gt; Other hands on her thigh. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Thinking I'm thinking about how cool the princess is, how good she looks with her new sword. &gt;&gt; She is just kind of making swishing noises under her bre like &gt;&gt; I'm going to bail Gorg out. &gt;&gt; Uh, I guess I'll just use my long bow &gt;&gt; like usual. &gt;&gt; Okay. And I'll use uh it twice again. So first one &gt;&gt; give me those attacks &gt;&gt; uh 23 &gt;&gt; more than enough &gt;&gt; and then second is uh 17 &gt;&gt; uh also enough. &gt;&gt; Okay. Um &gt;&gt; then give me the damage cuz this could be relevant. &gt;&gt; This could be very &gt;&gt; if I if I die don't let him make me into soup, man. &gt;&gt; Uh 14. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be soup, bro. 25 points of damage. So I I this time I'm I'm a little less confident than I was before and I just, you know, I queue him up one at a time and I fire the two at barricade. &gt;&gt; You hear And he does kind of grunt, but you can hear him right next to you, Gorg. And he's like, "It won't be enough." &gt;&gt; You're gross. &gt;&gt; Dude, you're so gross and weird. I hate you so much. &gt;&gt; You'll feel differently when you're one of us. Oh, I want to be a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] undead. &gt;&gt; Technically, this works by the letter of the law. Uh because technically you could hold your action to path to the grave, which you could do. Um so this would be the chance where you could do it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So I'm going to use path to the grave. &gt;&gt; Okay, perfect. &gt;&gt; You're going to use what? &gt;&gt; Don't worry about it. &gt;&gt; I don't like the way that sounds. &gt;&gt; Look, earlier you asked if there's undead turtles. There's about to be. So if if you can just uh relax and let me kind of do my thing, that'd be great. I just don't like how it's called path to the grave, man. &gt;&gt; Gorg, you see uh while you're there fighting cuz remember he's got a hand on you and he's biting you. You see GJ's head pops out of your shell and just just bites into his hand. &gt;&gt; Like shaking at him, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Take that, dude. &gt;&gt; Trying to help. Um, so Gorg, &gt;&gt; you need a big head, sir. &gt;&gt; Uh, so I roll. There we go. Oh, it's 18. &gt;&gt; That is enough to hit him. &gt;&gt; He's got a not insignificant number of hit points left. &gt;&gt; How does the vulnerability work from Catholic? &gt;&gt; It'll be double damage &gt;&gt; while he's amping up. &gt;&gt; I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] my shell. There's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] everywhere. &gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] It's like when the hippo with the tail thing and gross, dude. I'm so I'm almost dead. &gt;&gt; Do you have to do that part? &gt;&gt; Yes. right here is like this is hallowed ground s. &gt;&gt; So I'm going to be smiting. &gt;&gt; Do you have any higher level spell slots left? &gt;&gt; Um god under your spells. &gt;&gt; I I haven't used a &gt;&gt; Every time you smite it uses a spells a spell slot. So you've used up quite a few. &gt;&gt; I've done I think two smites. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I remember two. &gt;&gt; So I have four. &gt;&gt; Uh go to your spells. &gt;&gt; Spells. Yeah. And then all when you go down, how many level two slots have you got? &gt;&gt; Uh, two. Two of them. &gt;&gt; So you can hit him even harder twice &gt;&gt; with a level two smite. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It'll be an extra 4 D8. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; Plus another one, right? Cuz I'm dead. &gt;&gt; That is including it. &gt;&gt; Okay. So 4 D8. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; This is number one coming up for you, dude. &gt;&gt; This is what paladins do. &gt;&gt; There's a zero. &gt;&gt; That's That's 10. That's good. &gt;&gt; Oh gosh. Oh my god. &gt;&gt; 10 12 16 + 9 is 25 plus another 5 plus uh three is 33 cuz I get three plus on my d6. &gt;&gt; And then you double that. &gt;&gt; Was that already doubled or is that &gt;&gt; the total? 33 here. So 66 [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] damage. &gt;&gt; He had 53 left. &gt;&gt; So tell me what it looks like. is your child is like trying to help you. &gt;&gt; And I just I'm just co Oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I took off my mic. I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; For the audio listeners, he's removed his mic and excitement. So excited. And so I'm like I break out and I take the trident and it goes silent for a sec and I go and her and like what I consider Horizon as like a giant vision behind me which is a turtle with giant beautiful breasts and she's in like a gown and she's like she appears behind me as like some sort of like familiar &gt;&gt; it's like rest them on your shoulders. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I and I just I do a simple and it's kind of like a one-inch punch. I just go with the trident and it just it just like it's just like six inches of of power. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It feels like seven &gt;&gt; and it just goes and and um barricade is just kind of like like I I don't understand. And then white lights just start blows up. It says KO. And then I I like do a flip and I like stance down kind of like Neo. And then right below me, I'm in the I'm near a wall and the camera pans down and it just says &gt;&gt; and it just says Bon was here. &gt;&gt; Perfect. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; That was like a That was just like a video game, right? It was like two weirdly similar. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. Still bread. &gt;&gt; I'm writing it down. &gt;&gt; I don't know what you're right. I don't know the context of what you're writing down that much, right? You won't. I'm still probably up there. &gt;&gt; I agree with that. &gt;&gt; Selena looks over. She goes, "Oh, there's a list. Am I in the list?" &gt;&gt; I great Gorg is you have this amazing &gt;&gt; dude powers are so cool. &gt;&gt; You see, Cokehead looks at you and she says, &gt;&gt; "Why don't you do that for me? Give me a wisdom save." You want me to do a wisdom save? &gt;&gt; I do. &gt;&gt; You want me to show you how smart I am? &gt;&gt; I believe you. You're very wisdomist. I believe in you. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. You want to see how smart I am? 11 smart. &gt;&gt; When she says, "Why don't you do that for me?" You're like, "Okay, &gt;&gt; okay." &gt;&gt; Yeah. She goes, "I'll let you decide which one of them to kill. He's undead. Start with him. &gt;&gt; Cuz you have been charmed. &gt;&gt; You're on Coat's side now. &gt;&gt; Oh no. One hit point left. &gt;&gt; Gord is within an inch of his life and just turns and looks at you. &gt;&gt; Am I Am I like more Am I sentient? Am I like kind of myself but on her side? &gt;&gt; That is exactly it. Okay. You you were yourself but you're on her side. There is another level of this which is dominate which you're just a you're an empty vessel but with this you're you're you but you're like you're like I can kill room. That's cool. &gt;&gt; What's up so red? Listen guys, change of plans. I'm going to be trying to smite you guys cuz you guys feel like the enemy right now. &gt;&gt; What just happened? &gt;&gt; Where are you attacking then? &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm attacking. Do I have to choose? &gt;&gt; She said it was up to you, but then she was like, he's undead. He can die, but it's up to you. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Really strongly that it should be ran. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; I feel like in like &gt;&gt; don't agree. &gt;&gt; Maybe some sort of past life, he was mean to people like me. &gt;&gt; Can I offer a suggestion? &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Leonis. &gt;&gt; Leonus feels like a good idea. Feels like a good pick. &gt;&gt; Appears. He's like, "Hey, screw you guys." Not Leonus. Always Leonus. You You killed Leonus last time. &gt;&gt; You know what, guys? 1 to 10, it's Ron. So, do we know however do we know he's been charmed. &gt;&gt; You very much heard her say, "That's impressive. Do it for me." And you saw him be like, "Okay." &gt;&gt; I'm pretty sure he's charmed. &gt;&gt; That being said, &gt;&gt; while you're quickly, &gt;&gt; Stone Beard, it is actually your turn. Your friend is charmed with one hit point remaining. &gt;&gt; How far is Coette from me? &gt;&gt; Uh, what' I say? 40 ft. Yeah, &gt;&gt; 40 ft. So, out of running distance, &gt;&gt; I'll put her within running distance. &gt;&gt; So, I use I use I use Misty Step and uh my Misty Step looks like kind of like a piouette. And then I And then I'm right behind her. I'm like I'm like, "What's up? Feel big still?" &gt;&gt; She doesn't turn around, but she looks over her shoulder and she says, "It's up to you whether he lives or dies." Meanwhile, I'm just I have my trident pointed at R. I'm just going &gt;&gt; But it is your turn. &gt;&gt; Unfortunately, it's not up to me. It's up to Horizon. All right. I'm just going to do an attack. It is not reckless. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to swing my great axe. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; From behind her. 22. &gt;&gt; Uh, that is enough to hit her. &gt;&gt; Uh, I take my axe. I specifically use the butt of the axe. And then from behind her, just right in the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] skull, it's 12. It's pretty big. &gt;&gt; It's going to leave her sore as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You all hear this inhuman like she's like, &gt;&gt; "Ow." &gt;&gt; I whispered to Thimble, "I feel like he hasn't been hitting that good today." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And you whispered this to Thimble and she's like, "No, no, no, no, no. Screw these guys. They want to attack you. No. Screw these guys, man. Like, I don't understand. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Why do they Why are they always so mean to you, man? Why are they always so mean to you? You know what? Jealous. They're jealous. That's what it is. Look at me. That stuff Ran did earlier, that's a pretty boss. That's true. It was great. But hey, wait, wait, wait, wait. He wants to kill Ran, right? If you save Ran, then maybe Ron's going to keep being nice to you, though. &gt;&gt; I can hear everything you guys are talking about. &gt;&gt; No, I'm invisible. No, it's No, &gt;&gt; I have a plan. I'm invisible. You can't hear me. &gt;&gt; I have a plan, bro. I have a plan. Is Tor is a toral a humanoid? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Okay. I can recharm him. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; I can charm York. I'm conflicted on that cuz I like uh I like the the demon lady. &gt;&gt; She's like, "You think your magic is stronger than mine? &gt;&gt; I can give it a try." &gt;&gt; Like right there with you right behind like hitting her stone beard. Like she very much kind of like slapping the belly. She's like, "Let's see if you can do it. Let's see." No, I'm I'm interested in watching. I go wicked smile. &gt;&gt; Uh what is so what is your save DC? &gt;&gt; It's 12. &gt;&gt; Since her charm is a higher level, I'm going to give I will give you another save to see if you can get out cuz just beating his doesn't automatically mean you beat hers. So another wisdom save &gt;&gt; big four. &gt;&gt; You feel this coming off of Leonus. It feels good, but he's not he's not a her though. I mean like he I mean if you're into elves but &gt;&gt; I'm trying to send out these like little like a light blue like kind of dancing sort of like like a mist towards him. That's &gt;&gt; I might try to at ran's neck &gt;&gt; and it's just I feel like if I touch him he's going to die and I'm not I will do that. &gt;&gt; Start the spell Leonus when you're ready &gt;&gt; the spell. &gt;&gt; I'm doing the spell. &gt;&gt; That's the spell. &gt;&gt; I'll distract. Okay. &gt;&gt; She's like she's like Leonus strong fundamentals. &gt;&gt; Refreshing &gt;&gt; strong fundamentals. That was nice. &gt;&gt; Anyway, kill that guy. Although it's still no short turn, but she's like she's like, "No, kill him." But yeah. No, good job. Oh, great. &gt;&gt; Um, how healthier are you right now? Like, &gt;&gt; I have 10. I have 10 health. &gt;&gt; Wait, hang on. We just got out of order somehow. Like, cuz Stone Beard is still at the bottom of the round. Minkx and Barricade aren't doing anything. They're busy dying. Uh, but Princess Selena theoretically can do something. &gt;&gt; Shoot. &gt;&gt; Okay. Uh, let's &gt;&gt; let the women go. Yep. Let them speak. Selenia, can you &gt;&gt; Oh, now you want her to do some stuff. &gt;&gt; Help us out. &gt;&gt; She's like, and like kind of like looks back and forth and let's say, "Oh, oh, I have an idea." Um, she goes, "Um, Ran, no, you're you're you're all you're all, you know, um, that's okay. I'll just do it." You see, she holds her hands out in between her and Coette, a green strand of energy forms and she says, "Okay, so anytime I get hurt, she gets hurt, which I think that's good, right?" Like I if we're like stuck connected that &gt;&gt; anytime I get if we hurt her, does it hurt you? &gt;&gt; I don't know. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. You really kind of made this harder, I think, than I I'm telling I think I think that's not how it's going to work. I think I think it's if she hurts me, it's like why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself? That's what that's Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; yeah. I I never I've never I don't I've had powers for like &gt;&gt; So, if we kill you, it kills her, &gt;&gt; maybe. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Uh however, this does bring us back around to the top and ran, it is your turn. To be clear, &gt;&gt; if you drop him to zero, he goes into death saves. It was specifically the vampire sucking the life out of him that would have just killed and killed him. You can just knock him out. &gt;&gt; I feel like we knock him out and then we just once we finish the fight off, we get him back up because I don't think we're gonna unchar him. &gt;&gt; What if you tricked him? &gt;&gt; I'm thinking what you're thinking. &gt;&gt; Okay. I would like to shape shift. &gt;&gt; You are right in front of him, though. &gt;&gt; I'm charming. I'm not stupid. &gt;&gt; He's pretty stupid. &gt;&gt; I'm not stupid. I would like I would like the shapeshift into his vision of horizon which I still have. As he shiftious I go I go here boy. &gt;&gt; Give me deception. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh versus your insight &gt;&gt; 15. &gt;&gt; Dirty 20. &gt;&gt; You know we actually haven't shared with our friends here what he thinks Horizon looks like. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's was that in the pre- episode? It was &gt;&gt; graphically describe what Horizon his god looks like. &gt;&gt; Right. So, so what we determined &gt;&gt; this is like the record to show they thought of this, not me. &gt;&gt; This is the first thing that he brought to the first thing. &gt;&gt; He had images for every god in the image was like he was like I don't I've never DM' before but I have thought of this character. &gt;&gt; Listen, I was I was trying to sell the show. Okay. &gt;&gt; I was like, I know what'll work. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Um Okay. So, uh, what what I vaguely remember was I saw, uh, in in Gorg's stuff a drawing that he made of his god. Uh, it was like almost like fan art. And it was a a turtle woman wearing a long beautiful gown with like comically large breasts, like extremely large breasts. What what a child thinks when they think about breasts, basically. And I turn into that turtle &gt;&gt; and it has a caption exercise says nothing personnel kid. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So here's what happens. You're you turn and look at Stone Beard because again the nature of the charm is you don't necessarily bear them any ill will. But she's like will you kill that dude? You're like yeah of course. So you look away at Stone Beard. Look back and your god horizon stands before you. &gt;&gt; I really hate doing this but I &gt;&gt; the main character. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh uh. Gorg. Gorg. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Horizon. &gt;&gt; You can't hurt me. &gt;&gt; Of course. I would never. &gt;&gt; I'm Horizon. Of course. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's cool. &gt;&gt; This is God. &gt;&gt; So happy to meet you again. &gt;&gt; That's great. If you think so. Can you do me a favor? &gt;&gt; Oh, yes. Anything anything for you? &gt;&gt; So, like the what the thing you're about to do to me? Can you do it to like the purple one over there? &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I was going to Well, I was going to attack Ran. I don't know where he went. You look amazing. &gt;&gt; I Thank you so much. Anywhere. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's enough of that. Can you attack her? &gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely. Yes. &gt;&gt; So, Gorg, I know this is very confusing and I'm going to let you adjudicate this, but magically right now, Coette is your best friend. &gt;&gt; Got it. Okay. &gt;&gt; Uh I don't know if for you that means attack someone else. I don't know if it means do nothing. I don't know cuz you have dueling charm. &gt;&gt; It's a lot of emotional conflict. Yeah. And and I turn to her and then I'm like, &gt;&gt; look, look, Gorg, she's like, you understand what's &gt;&gt; Yeah. No, I I have to I have to &gt;&gt; look I understand it's confusing for you. It's like you she's like really close friends with you. Does that really work? &gt;&gt; Could you maybe just go over there and just go think on it? What you want to do? Go over there and think for a little bit. &gt;&gt; Spend some time thinking, can I go think for a little while? &gt;&gt; What is there to think about? I &gt;&gt; You're right. You're right. There's no there's nothing to think. &gt;&gt; I'm Horizon. &gt;&gt; Yeah, she's Horizon, &gt;&gt; you know. &gt;&gt; Yorg. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Look at these. &gt;&gt; All right. I'm going to give you another wisdom save with advantage that Horizon has deployed uh the proletizers there to &gt;&gt; an age-old tactic. Maybe the first &gt;&gt; maybe the first religious &gt;&gt; it's a 19 &gt;&gt; more than enough to break the dude. &gt;&gt; She literally What is there to think about? Kill her. Him them that. Uh, [Laughter] &gt;&gt; there is no way that worked better than my charm spell. &gt;&gt; I don't like that it worked better either. 100% the thing that would work better than your charm spell. &gt;&gt; Horizon, I'm so glad you're here. Ran's gone, which is weird, but guess what? Coette soups on [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and it's turtle. &gt;&gt; And she just looks at you. She's like, who are these people? They're the worst of the terodin, but also my loyal friends. &gt;&gt; But uh anything else, Ron? Having used religious pornography to help your friend? &gt;&gt; Uh I I I snap I used to go back to Baron and then I just get as far away from God. &gt;&gt; I was looking at Stone Beard while he said that. Yeah. And then I look back and I'm like, where'd she go? What a blessing. Anyway, &gt;&gt; she she told us she had a meeting in Ward Ward W &gt;&gt; dress store. &gt;&gt; The dress store. &gt;&gt; I spent years studying that spell. Tough life for a god. You're always busy. Rome, welcome back. &gt;&gt; It is It is Superman and Clark K. Leonus, it is your turn again. You can use your bonus action to move the hunter mark to her if you like. &gt;&gt; I will do this uh quickly quickly. &gt;&gt; I will say this in the strictest technical sense. Casting charm would have cancelled the hunter mark because you can't uh concentrate on both. But I didn't say that. So I'm I'm gonna let it go. &gt;&gt; I can let that ride because I would have chosen that option having known that. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you can only concentrate on one thing at a time. &gt;&gt; I think I'll go uh &gt;&gt; It's like real life. &gt;&gt; Now that &gt;&gt; Hey, for the new viewers who found us from D and D, that was really funny. that if this is the first time you're tuning into the yard, &gt;&gt; that one hits, if you're a yard, &gt;&gt; 100 episodes in, check back to this and you'll be like, &gt;&gt; I now that we're all on the same page and my magic means [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nothing. I I am going to attack Coette with my my long bow. So, I'll I'll turn around, give it a &gt;&gt; The charm would be your action. &gt;&gt; Lock the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in, Leonus. Uh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; You really put it all on that D charm dispell. But you all would have been cheering if it worked. &gt;&gt; Yeah, 100%. &gt;&gt; Leonus, am I close enough to anytime, &gt;&gt; dude? I literally can't do anything cuz I used his spell. &gt;&gt; Yeah, use his spell. Yeah, there may there may not be a relevant &gt;&gt; I'm just kind of frozen with indecision grappling with the fact that my spell that I have spent the better part of my adolescent years practicing did not have any impact. But Ran changing into a big breasted turtle that he saw from a drawing succeeded where my drawing look like doodlebish. &gt;&gt; Perfect. Gorg again with one hit point and Coette goes after you. Uh, it is your turn. &gt;&gt; I have had such a confusing day. &gt;&gt; But Coette, your time is up, you dumb bastard. You ready for this? Are you afraid of me smiting you? I still have a level two spell slot left. Do you know what that means? &gt;&gt; She turns and looks at you. She's like, "You do know I'm going to kill it, right?" No, you won't. Devil, come on. Let's do it. &gt;&gt; Let's do this. Mhm. I'm going to roll. I'm going to attack Vicious Trident. &gt;&gt; You technically You have two attacks. &gt;&gt; 19 total. &gt;&gt; Uh &gt;&gt; I'm a little woozy. I'm one HP. &gt;&gt; You go in the first one. The trident is going straight for her face and she just holds her hand up and an energy field appears in front of her. She goes down. &gt;&gt; That's crazy, you guys. &gt;&gt; 19 is a lot. &gt;&gt; 19 is so much. Here we go again. &gt;&gt; My head wasn't that bad though, huh guys? &gt;&gt; Horizon, I know you were just here, but I need you one more time in spirit. Here we go. Nine. the second time like trying to correct for the shield to like hit her. She just drops it and the trident just goes past her head and she goes and she literally just sort of like touches it and she says when I bring you back from the dead I'll let you keep this keep me dead dude. &gt;&gt; She says I distinctly remember you asking if there was any tor undead and he said there's about to be. He's right. And she reaches out and she just goes to touch you. &gt;&gt; Oh. &gt;&gt; Um, &gt;&gt; don't dude. &gt;&gt; Uh, what is your AC? &gt;&gt; 19. &gt;&gt; Uh, she reaches out and she just puts her hand on your chest and she says, "You remind me of a guy I used to know. His name is Bon. Wouldn't shut the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up." Then you see electricity just jolts through Gorg's body and he just collapses as she does the absolute weakest spell she has and still does eight points of damage. &gt;&gt; He's smoking like shell is just smoking and burnt. &gt;&gt; Okay. Ooh, that was almost a crit. You think she just drops him and she turns her back to the two of you to just look right at you, Stone Beard, because it is your turn. and she says we can keep doing this dance. It's not going to change anything. So you can take your friend and go or you can watch the rest of them die. Guys, I have a plan. I'll attack her for the front. You levy arrows into her back. Those back shots should be enough to take her down. I I can hear you. She's like, "Oh, you know, back shots are my weakness." I thought she didn't remember meeting me during the war. &gt;&gt; Okay, there's a lot of dances I've danced that people have said aren't worth dancing to. &gt;&gt; Bear in mind, I'm a lot dumber when I'm in rage. He's like, you &gt;&gt; But when it's all said and done, what's the dance that matters the most? &gt;&gt; The last dance. &gt;&gt; Dude, &gt;&gt; you saw that scroll, huh? I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] swing my great axe. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; It's 11. &gt;&gt; You see this time? Last time she caught it. She caught it by the blade. &gt;&gt; This time while you're saying all this, she takes one step forward. You swing where like, you know, it's got that indent. It sort of like hooks around her neck. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; And she just like stands there right in your face. And then as she stands in my face, I say and I pull out a Pokéball from my pocket. I go, "Go Eldridge cannon." And an Eldridge cannon appears behind her. &gt;&gt; Uh and it's of course the Eldrich &gt;&gt; Flamethrower probably. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'll go flamethrower. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; And how does it work? &gt;&gt; Uh it is a save from her. There should be like a number. &gt;&gt; Uh and she got a big old two. So she very dramatically. She's like, "Steone beard, you don't know the As the fire hits her in the back." &gt;&gt; Mhm. And it and it it literally incinerates her back clothing and hits her for four and all the clothes are revealed. And I go, "The perfect spot to strike." &gt;&gt; She lets out the ancestral vampire noise of when this happens, you know. Uh per uh anything else, Stone Beard? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You see, um uh Selenia is like, "Am I am I supposed to pardon the back shot?" Oh. Yeah. Okay. and she like comes running up and also does the same thing and hits twice again where she like holds up the dagger a little bit and she goes like I don't know how just stabs her with the green flame blade and then stabs her with the shadow blade and she goes, "Okay, you guys, I know we're kind of in the middle of something, but can I stay with you forever?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. No, we're down. We are down. Uh, and she's going to hit her twice. Uh, which brings us back around to you, Ron. Oh, I should point out something important about your grave cleric abilities that I keep forgetting. Because you are a grave cleric, you have two abilities, um, that you can use. Uh, you have one called spare the dying, um, which is a cantrip, but you can do it from 30 ft away. You just stop people from dying. It doesn't heal them, but it gets them out of death saves. So a they'll stay unconscious but they won't die. &gt;&gt; That's one thing you can do. &gt;&gt; The second thing as a grave cleric is whenever a person is at zero, anytime you heal, you automatically do the maximum. &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. &gt;&gt; That's just a grave cleric thing. So if a person if a person is out, whatever heal you use is always maxed out. &gt;&gt; But unless I should definitely just heal. &gt;&gt; Well, that is Yes. Okay. However, let me do one thing. &gt;&gt; Did you know this and you didn't do it last time? Well, some of that was my fault that I I'd undermined. &gt;&gt; I'm pretty sure I remember you explaining this and him being like, "No, I don't &gt;&gt; I wouldn't call anyone out here." And &gt;&gt; Nick, I'm a child of divorce, man. Give me a break. &gt;&gt; That being said, Yorg, you've visited this in between realm a few times now, and you've had a number of gods appear and speak to you. One of which said it was Horizon, but Super wasn't cuz of course &gt;&gt; wasn't wasn't Horizon. I don't know why you'd lie either as a god, but whatever. &gt;&gt; But you are back in that same room that you saw before. You hear explosions going off. You hear people screaming. You hear people saying things like, "The eastern wall's broken. They're overwhelming us. They're going to launch the hammer on us." And you see Coette look and she's like, "They they can't. We we haven't had time to evacuate." And they said, "There's no time. We have to go. they're going to do it. And she's like, "What about the anvil? We're not within the zone. It's going to happen now." And you see her stand up and she says, "All of this, they didn't care. Our lives didn't mean anything to them." And you see just from off in the distance, a blinding flash of light like a sun erupts in the distance. You see her turn and look at it and just anger comes over her face as the energy that washes over. And presumably Ran was going to heal. &gt;&gt; Yes. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. Did you heal me yet? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. You're good, man. You're What? We're talking. &gt;&gt; Wait, I'm alive. &gt;&gt; Yeah. What do you heal him for again? It's max. Whatever the spell is capable of doing is what it does. It's a d8, so it would be eight, right? &gt;&gt; He actually he's capable of even doing it at third level if you wanted, which would give him 25, &gt;&gt; dude. Juice me big if you wanted to. &gt;&gt; Juice me, Ron. &gt;&gt; Juice me. &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; yeah, I juice you for 17. &gt;&gt; No, 25. It's max. &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh, right. Yeah. Then why even do third level? &gt;&gt; Because that much more. You know what I mean? You can give him different level. &gt;&gt; It's not max of his whole health. So, eight times three. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. Yeah. It is either 8, 16, or 24. &gt;&gt; Plus one. Yeah, &gt;&gt; plus one. &gt;&gt; I will say since the healing works different for you as a grave cleric when he's dying basically, what does it look like when you heal him? &gt;&gt; I just hold my hand out and sort of like the opposite of the effect that when I go undead, like a very warming color comes over their body. Let's pause. And &gt;&gt; and they sort of just like come back to life. Like their skin, you know, &gt;&gt; it's good for his skin and his hair. Yeah. Well, welcome. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ, that was scary. Horizon Christ. &gt;&gt; She was betrayed. &gt;&gt; Who? &gt;&gt; She was betrayed. Gohead, I saw it. You were betrayed. I understand. The the the anvil, the plan, they they they nuked everyone. It wasn't fair. I get it. You see, she turns and looks at you and then she looks at you and she's like, "Is this a trick?" &gt;&gt; No, I I was in the afterlife. Horizon wasn't there. I would have remembered. And I saw it all. I betrayed you. &gt;&gt; You see, she walks right over to you like again knowing you could hit her again. And honestly, Selena could too. Uh, and she just walks away from both of you. &gt;&gt; I went up for a hit of opportunity and then I'm like a bad time. &gt;&gt; It's like when when when you do it, Selenia does it. It would have been a 20 too. Like she's like, "I got it. &gt;&gt; I also want some of it." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um and she walks right over to you &gt;&gt; and she looks you in the eye and she says, "You know, &gt;&gt; I saw I saw it all." &gt;&gt; I surrender. And just holds her hands out. &gt;&gt; Forging day. [Music] Dude, that's crazy to yell. She doesn't like Fortune. &gt;&gt; It's like It's like yelling 9/11 to like New Yorker. &gt;&gt; I don't know. I don't know what happened, but I'm down. &gt;&gt; Uh, well, I can explain, guys. Coette Stone Beard, I don't know why you don't remember. Oh, you got sent away. &gt;&gt; I wasn't there. &gt;&gt; Oh my god, this is all making so much sense. Beeron, what was his name? &gt;&gt; Uh, Jackson. Jackson. &gt;&gt; Jackson Ran. A different guy probably. There were all these people and they enacted the hammer and anvil plan and they just killed everyone. They didn't evacuate. I get it. You're saying I was there. It's it it looked definitely not like you. You were also nice but kind of not nice &gt;&gt; to me. You look like a lot of the undead. &gt;&gt; So it's like a hurtful stereotype. &gt;&gt; This was me. I think that's kind of another racist thing for me. Like Strike 2. &gt;&gt; Is that a race? Cuz we all kind of can be there. No, &gt;&gt; it's a good question. It's a spiritual question. &gt;&gt; I don't watch anime. Don't &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I didn't know. I wanted to stay. I remember. I wanted to stay and fight, but I I didn't know. &gt;&gt; Didn't know because they didn't tell you. &gt;&gt; Who's they? &gt;&gt; All of them. They've told you that after the war, everyone just agreed to this peacekeeping force. Everyone just agreed to all of this oversight, right? &gt;&gt; The terror was created by all the nations. &gt;&gt; It's never that simple. That watch. I guarantee you. Watch what happens when you take me back. When I'm supposed to go on trial, watch and see who objects. No, I give up. Take me. Why do you give up that easy? Because I need you all to see what happens next. Cuz the truth is, I don't know who decided to still unleash the weapon on us when we were still here. I don't know who decided our lives were forfeit. But I would love to find out. &gt;&gt; Why didn't you just tell us all this? Why'd you have to kill Riley? It was okay. You killed Bejorn. &gt;&gt; I didn't kill Riley. &gt;&gt; You kind of killed Riley. You have to be We admitted when we were killed a lot of guys named Riley. I It's &gt;&gt; But also at the Nexus and the forging day, people died. You didn't need to do it. We would have listened. &gt;&gt; No, you wouldn't. You didn't until you saw. &gt;&gt; We didn't. She's right. &gt;&gt; That's pretty true. That's pretty true. &gt;&gt; That's the proof immediately. Sucks. &gt;&gt; You guys trust me. &gt;&gt; How do we know what you saw is real, &gt;&gt; right? Like you don't. But you trust me enough. &gt;&gt; I trust you. &gt;&gt; But it's a vision. &gt;&gt; Could be anything. &gt;&gt; I mean, I saw a vision of Horizon. That was pretty cool. &gt;&gt; Not a good backup. &gt;&gt; Well, I know a lot of people I know what Horizon actually looks like, don't I? Actually, all of you at this point have seen Horizon. We've all seen Horizon. &gt;&gt; That's not a good Horizon doesn't Well, Horizon is his beautiful god. &gt;&gt; This is This is a tool that keeps working for us. We cannot spoil it. Now, &gt;&gt; there's no reason to harm a pious man. &gt;&gt; I like when you say stuff like that. Also, you got sent away, but I'm sure you heard of some stuff. What did they tell you? &gt;&gt; Died because they underestimated the size of the horde. But then we were able to kill the horde with our anvil attack. &gt;&gt; Yes, that but essentially that there was um a weapon. The details were always vague that stopped the flow of these things coming into the world, but the war raged on because so many of them were already here. &gt;&gt; It was sold like this is the final solution, like we're going to have this wrapped up this weekend type thing. And later it was like actually no we turned off the faucet but there's still a flood and the war actually went on for years after that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's when I became the goat. &gt;&gt; Gohead. Do you act alone? &gt;&gt; She's like no many of us stand at the crossroads. &gt;&gt; Who leads? &gt;&gt; And you see she just says I think I've said enough for today. &gt;&gt; Are you taking me in or not? &gt;&gt; Book them stone bread. &gt;&gt; Wait. &gt;&gt; I want this. I want you to parade me through the streets. I want &gt;&gt; I want to find out the truth, but I don't want it to be at the cost of your shame. &gt;&gt; You can go into different people. Can you go into objects? &gt;&gt; I don't think so. I've never tried. She's like, also I really like this one. I don't You don't like this is &gt;&gt; it's a good You look good, &gt;&gt; but you just look like an evil person. &gt;&gt; Oh, we could put her back in the princess. &gt;&gt; No, that's crazy. I kind of like this. &gt;&gt; I want to see your search history later. &gt;&gt; Your scroll search is like my hair. Like look at this. Like &gt;&gt; no weird scroll searches on my end. &gt;&gt; I have the ability to make an item. I can tinker with an item and I can make it and you can be in it. Would you prefer to do that and then we can find out the truth or do you want us to parade you? Is that what you really want? &gt;&gt; Self flagagillation as someone who is extremely religious can often be good but I don't think in this case it will be. How about we split the difference? In the name of my god, Aden the live scroller. I will let you go ahead, but I swear I will come and turn myself in when you say the time is right. And she looks at you and she says, I swear on the blood of everyone who died defeating those bastards. I swear. &gt;&gt; Well, I swear on Elias's name will uncover the truth. You see, she looks down at Minkx in barricade and she says, "Soldiers die in war, but hopefully it won't all be for nothing." And she reaches in and pulls out a purple sending stone cuz otherwise you guys are just going to have a box of these things be like, "Hello." No, that's not hello. Just you hit them all. She hands you a purple sending stone and she says, "When you say I will turn myself in, but you need to ask them to tell you how they founded my and how they founded Leo. The answer is not what you think." And that is a good place for us to stop. I was so close when you were like forging day. I'm like, we're done. Yeah.
