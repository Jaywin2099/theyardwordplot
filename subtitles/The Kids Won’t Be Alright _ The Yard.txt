Did anyone We had a bet last episode. Did anyone see anybody famous? Dude, yes. I had a dream that I met Jack Black. Does that count? That's so interesting. You know what? Personally, I don't think that counts. What happened in the dream? I wasn't able to get a pig with him, so it doesn't count. Imagine you took a picture with Jack Black in your dream. You wake up, look at your phone, it's there. Oh, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Was a pic part of the deal? Yes. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Well, who's yours? I saw Nick Croll this morning. You know what's funny? This morning? Yeah. You know what's funny, guys? You know who we were all with, but I was the only one who noticed. Jack Black. No, he was at the movie at Good Fellas. He was at the movie last night and I saw him and I said, "Don't tell Lewig and Aiden that he's here. I'm going to try to get a picture with him." And I failed. I couldn't I couldn't find him after the movie. You had to. But he was there in the beginning and I was like I was like he just walked right in and I was like, "Don't tell them." Whoa. Dude, it's so funny, too, cuz he I love that. Shut the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. You were You were Babe Ruth calling in shot. It's like we all said he would be the easiest cuz we all knew and then he and he showed up. There was one more famous person. Who's the bald guy in Sarah Silverman show? Sarah Silverman show. The tall [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bald guy. Yeah, I know you're talking about Justin something maybe. He was also there last night. He uh it was packed. Was Jack Black at Good So Shake invited everyone to go watch Good Fellas at the at the movie theater and at the Quinton movie theater at the Vista. At the Vista, which is Quinton Tarantino [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bro? [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] come in my mouth and call me a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] girl's name, bro. Is that what you said last night? When you didn't like the show going, kick his ass. No, he was pretty normal. He was kind of being go loot box. Oh, dude, dude. When [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Hey, spoilers. when they die. Did he go chicken jacket? Okay, that's uh he was alone. He was alone. That's pathetic. That's pathetic. It's not pathetic. He's Jack Black. So, it's fun to watch movies by yourself. Yeah. And also, guy who didn't go by himself. Well, I did go by myself. What are you talking? Yeah. What's going on? All every all the We have zero. He's the king of information. He's uh Bakashori Gajin.

I'm repping your You randomized the whole costume. This is not random. So, we're not going to talk about anyone else's fits. I think this got that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on. Hold on. I think this episode has the this might be the first episode we've ever done where if we were ranking all of us by outfits, you guys are arguably the top two. Lwig's in top two with Armor King's dark upper pants. Dude, I think Budwig looks so have that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on. Okay, we got to we got to fix the top half, Aiden. We got to fix the top half. Take the jacket off. Let's see with no jacket cuz I think it's better. You're wearing some sort of mesh peasant shirt. You have to blur that, Archie. Yeah, the shirt's money. I like the shirt. I like the pants. I like the shoes. Hat don't love. Why do you not like about the hat? Oh, dude. You're Justin Bieber without it. Oh my god. Show. I mean, fine. That is money. Now shoots up to number one. You're so handsome. Fine. I'll freaking do this for [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] looks. It is pretty freezing in here. Uh, it's Chili Bears. Also have the the orb of coffee. We can also kill AC. Can I Can I Eric Revince? May I? Maybe one would call it my job in a way. Thank god you saved it for now. You really held back on Aryan Grievances. I'm talking. I don't know what he's going to whine about. Imagine Aiden takes that off and reveals a giant dreadlock nest. Oh, yeah. That'd be so funny, dude. Oh, Archie. Uh, Photoshop that. But they do it for us. And can we just put just an unfathomable amount of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Finn and and Minoxidil? And can we just It's not about your hairline. I want it to get as long as possible. You just want it to grow faster. And I want to give you a perm. Okay, dude. Aiden with a perm would be sick. I mean, I think I'm about to do that. About to get a perm? I don't think you're long enough for a perm. About to get No, I'm about to start medication. Let's send you to Turkey and get it down to like here. That's what happens when you hang out with Atriarch for more than two weeks. You're like, Jesus Christ. Convinces you to get finasteride. Got to do it. I've seen I've seen it. I think I think this is Doug's fans also call him bald and I and I had this realization this week is there's no there's no winning if Doug's bald I'm I will be bald forever there's it doesn't matter the amount of hair that I have I think bald is uh now anyone over 30 without long hair yes that's not what bald is or a visibly snatched hairline when you turn 30 will they turn on you they've turned on me and I'm not 30 so yes I'm 29 and I'm still being referred to as 30 I mean I sat next to Josh who's who's bald now, bro. He looks like Kratos. Middle of the movie. Middle of the movie. Josh reached over. I'm holding a box of candy. Josh reaches over and grabs my hand, grabs the candy. So, I think he's just taking the candy to Bites home. But then he puts the candy down in my lap, takes my hand, and puts it on his belly. And then he leans over and whispers into my ear, "Now you have to make a wish." during the movie. During this is the like halfway. It's called It's called Wish Maxing. He's been doing it for a week. Good fellas. He's so bored all the time, dude. It sucks, bro. He can't watch movies. He can't do anything. No one else cancels in Good Fellas. Like, I fell asleep at the towards the end of Good Fellas cuz I watched it a week ago. Oh, so you didn't have to Google the ending. No, that's good because I watched it. Hey, I showed up so late cuz I was doing this shoot with Pokey that ran super late. Did you get a picture with her? I didn't get a pick with her. So, I also lose. Wow. Oh, by the way, I met the guitar tech for Cigarettes After Sex. Did you get a picture with him? I didn't. We all lose. We all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lose. But we all met somebody really. You know what? I saw a picture with Jack. You're the smallest loser. You know what I mean? Smallest loser. I saw a picture with Jack Black. Yeah. You actually had the intention and idea. You should have filmed him like a creeper. No, just film him for a minute straight. Say chicken jockey. Breathe heavy. I said I said that's Jack Black from the Minecraft movie. All right. So, you're hanging out with Pokemon, not getting a picture. I show up super late. The movie started. It's like an hour plus into it. It's after the heist. Have you seen Good Health? Okay. Is after the heist is when I show up and they're just talking about how much money they have and how it's going to so late in the movie. It's so late. That's not even half. It's more than halfway through. It's a chunky part through. Which heist? Lithansa heist. And and so what a few heists the big one. The big heist for the six millie. There's good 1994 Good fellows spoilers by the way in this episode. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All which is also based on real events and real people. Yes. Uh and so I walk in the theater and all Shake sent me is he was like I'm back right. I have a seat for you. And I said great. And I get there and I message him. He doesn't answer. Makes sense. He don't have his phone out. Watching a movie. He's watching a movie. They explicitly, you know, how normally the movie has like a screen that says like take please silence your phone. They had a person come and be like, hey, all phones need to be off. And so it felt a little more intense at the Quinton Tarantino foot job theater. That person told us, you know. Yeah. And then they said foot jobs will be coming through the aisles. Please flag down if you bought the deluxe package. And also there will be a set from Drizz after the show. Drizz. It's Drizz set and Quinton Tarantino comes out, says the N word for an hour straight and then he remixes that live with a repeater. Let the Skrillex drop. Uh, that's Hollywood. I I go to the back right and I saw someone who I thought was yingling. It was just a guy with some facial hair and a and a hat. Didn't look like a baby breastfeeding from its mother. Yeah. Was it a guy playing with a gummy figurine? It's a guy who just kept saying, "I don't know a number above a thousand." And so I I go to this guy. I go I go, "Where's Shake?" And and then when he replies, I instantly know I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up because he goes, "What?" The guy. The guy I say to the guy, "Where's Shake?" And the guy just goes, "It's not even like a human's name." No, it's not Daniel. So So I realize it wasn't Yingling. And you from the other side of that, are you just are do you think this is a weird guy wondering where like milkshakes are? No shakes at the venue. And only when I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stand up, look at him again cuz there's a bright flash in the movie. I see it's like a girl is like cuddled next to him. Oh, so it's not Shake. It's definitely not Shake or Yingo or anyone who works in this office. So I just sit and I watch the second the last third of Good Fellas by myself. Really all you got to watch. Wow. Yeah. So good. You got to watch the the first 20 to 30 and the last 20 to 30. What I realize is like if I watch it from there and then you go and then you watch another it might be good. Yeah. Yeah. I think so. Guy who watches YouTube shorts only now. Oh no. I watch a 10-minute YouTube video about a 79year-old who's going to dunk again and then you said you showed me it and you're like banger video. It is a banger. Like it's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like you're trying to hurt my feelings. Well, no. I I thought actually it's a genuine banger. Okay. Love. Do you think adults should have toys? I Okay, I listened to the primo. He hated it. I know everything. Isn't that funny? I didn't What? He He bitched and complained that we talked about something for more than 10 minutes. This is the most insane psychopathic. So, you know slime well enough. Now that we've we've now that you've collected all the contextual conversational clues, what do you think actually happened? Okay. So, I would like to hear you piece it together. Yeah. Um cuz I'm confident you can. Maybe. Okay. So, maybe Lewig had just said something like, "I know I wouldn't have sex with you something to set him off, something to get him rolling down a hill that you can't pull him out of. And then and then he goes, "Yeah, you don't want to have sex with me. And also, I bet you watched the last episode and you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hated it." And Lig is like, "No, I just said that I listened to it." Uh, and then Slime just kind of made something up. That's remarkably close. That's remarkably close. What happened? What happened is they they did the premium episode without me cuz you scammed. Go ahead. I did. Well, I did not scam. I was owed just to be clear cuz you said I scammed. I was owed a premium pass because you laughed when I showed you my butthole. And the deal was if you laughed, I'm allowed to skip a premium episode. Is this not true? You weren't on Did this not happen? This did happen. I hadn't even considered this angle. Actually, I know. He said this today and I was like I think on paper he might have a you had such a strong reason without pulling out that card that you could save that card for later. No, he did not have a strong reason of the card. I'm cool with my get out of jail free card which I've had stored. So, if I didn't laugh at your butthole when you showed us your butthole and spread it open in front of my face and eyes, you'd say sorry. I would apologize or I would have communicated ahead of time before leaving. So, so this is in your mind's like I can take the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] off. He laughed at my ass. I got the week off and I get to choose one. I use it and I use it. I think that he's right. He's just right. This one's tough. And what happened is I said I listen to the primo cuz me and cutie did a road trip and every time there's a lull in what we're listening to she goes theyard she listen like fine cuz she's caught up she listens a so we listen to an episode I was on that we listen to primo and and he was like oh you listen to it what it was about was like 40 minutes about trinkets and he goes oh 40 minutes oh 40 minutes about oh cuz what we should do is make get in shorts can't talk about something for 40 minutes and explore an idea. That's what I said. It's like we explored an idea. What I said is that you talked about drinking for 40 minutes. Is that wrong? You said it in a way. Let me let me emulate the way he said it and he's like he's like eating food and he's sunburned. He looks kind of like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] He looks kind of like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Yeah. And he kind of like from a and he ate like a bunch of pastries earlier. So he's like a little bloated. Bloated [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] So he rolls into he rolls into the room. I'm talking. You were eating pastry while I was having Oh my god. I took two bites and then I ate four. I don't think you rolled into the room. My perfect body digested it, used it for energy. And he was like I was like, "Yo, I you listen to the Primo?" He's like, "Yeah." I was like, "What's it about?" He's like, "Yeah, you guys talked about drinks for like 40 minutes." That's how he said it. He's acting for stage, clearly. That's how he said it. I was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] there. We can also, as Ben told me, I was also there. Well, what's the verdict? Do you think And again, there's more than the conversation than trinkets. Lovely. We talked about adult toys, too. Yeah. You talked about how you want adult toys to be separate from sex toys, which I actually think is the smartest thing that was said on the podcast. Thank you. Well, in your head, what's an adult toy? What would be an example right now? An adult toy would be like the amaranth [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like a bad dragon that you put up your ass and it hits your heart. What? Yes. Oh. Oh, sorry. If we made the split, what would an adult toy then be? Rainbow. I think Nick then lost the plot cuz I do think it is dangerous weapons toys like BB guns, paintball guns. I think that's No, that's part of it. That's time to innovate. We need time cuz that's all we got right now. I think the gum that when you pull it, it shocks you should be considered an adult toy. But no, children can enjoy a shock. I think they're intense. They're intense. Yeah, children can take that. No, don't say that sentence. Children enjoy electricity. Guy who tes children in his free time. I pranked kids all the time. What? Uh and then also I No, now. Oh, now I realized Japan's already done this. Tases the kids. Adult toy. Well, probably, but adult toys. Taser party. Kids only. Oh, well, I guess so. They What do you mean, I guess? Can you think of like a a Japanese adult toy that is not good for kids? That is not sexual in nature? Yeah. Yeah. Wait, wait, sorry. That's not good for kids. Yeah, I would say like the more intense model cars, model trains, like those the Gundams. You have to brought this up in my example. We talked about this. Yeah, I brought this up. The the painting Gundams, all those things are adult toys cuz they take too much effort for children to do cuz they have low attention spans. That's right. Chicken jocking. That's right. What's chicken jockeying in Japanese? Chicken joy. Hamiki. Okay. My Please let me a grievance, dude. Okay, let me guess. It's about the freaking office. You're freaking mad. You freaking don't get to come in and act like hair. Okay, hold on. Don't move. Don't move. So So your hair It's being pulled back by the hat. Can you actually tilt your face towards the camera? Need to take a picture. So, it's being It looks like you're way more balding than you really are because it's pulling it into a horseshoe shape and then it's creating a shadow that looks like thin hair. Dude, you look like Chris Martin if he was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. Okay. Wow. It's really funny looking. All right, continue. Air your grievance. I have been coming into the office. We've been talking about it a little bit on the podcast. Little bit. A little bit. Wow. Some would say it's dominated. Every early segment of the podcast is slime office terrorist segment. Arie, can you just put up a little graphic of where to skip to if you don't want this? That's not like that. It's good. I've been coming to the office. It's been great. Everyone's been enjoying my company. Kelby is here, etc. He looks kind of like Aiden looks now with the hairline. It's very beautiful. I think a beautiful mature man is a beautiful thing in this planet. Thank you. I mean, I I've just turned 30 and I've I'm learning a lot about myself. Don't chop. Okay. So, so, so I'm coming in the office and Aiden takes it upon himself. I'm taking up Brian Herren's desk, who hasn't come in in a while. He works from home a lot and that's fine. And I put all my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on that desk. I put a little computer and I work on the little computer. And I play Street Fighter. I play a little computer. He puts a desktop PC. It's mini ITX. Suck me in my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nuts. Desktop PC. It's still miniITX. Setting up a desktop PC. You what you did is you hijacked a table that someone else had and then when someone brought it up you said suck it from the back. No, what I did is Aiden cuz this guy's never coming in. He doesn't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] care. He just works from home. Brian's a cool guy. Whatever. He works from [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] home. Aiden finds out finds Brian. He corners him at basketball. Rips off his shirt. Rips off his shirt. Rips off his pants. Play plays with it. I'm going to I'm going to read back the court record from what you told me before the podcast started, which is you on all fours, face down, ass up next to me. Yeah, his face was down ass. He actually had un unbelievable sexual. His arch was insane. It was just like to better visualize this scenario, the office has been like there's only been a couple people in the office the last few weeks because of the Japan trip and people taking time off post the Japan trip. There's like nine people in the office today. This is packed a bunch of people. I want to cut your head with sword. You're doing downward dog. So downward dogs. And after doing downward dog, he goes to me. He goes, "Uh, slime says, "What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is Brian Harren doing here? What is he doing here? Why is he here? Get him out of here. Why is this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] here?" Headphones on, ignoring all of this. Brian is literally in a meeting going, "Yeah, so I worked for a few years in the game industry." And then Slime's just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cursing him out for doing his job. Oh, Brian's locked in doing his job. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Sucker. He's been He's been doing his job just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happily fine for 6 months. I'm so glad you said that. From home. I'm so glad you said that because that's another grievance I need to bring up cuz we had a all hands meeting. My first one in 3 weeks. Okay. So, it's not really all hands. Uh well, some of the hands meeting. Some of the hands. And and Kelby on the meeting. Uh first thing he says to me, he goes, "Slime called me a cocksucker." Dude, that's crazy. Okay. Why is it crazy? That's crazy. I don't know what he did, but I didn't. Pause. Pause. Viewers at home, do you think that was crazy? Go to your phones. We'll find out. I called him. I feel like I've heard you say [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Kelby so many times. And you know what? There's a distinction there. Adjective, not a noun. And that's different. That's what we're drawing the distinction on. I think it's important. So, you did call him [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but in I didn't call him a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You called him crazy. What was the context? [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Kelby. I I feel like the adjective is worse. That's why the adjective definitely implies he's doing it. You know why we keep this this gun locked up? Because if Kelby sees it while he's here, it's over. No, you crack this narrative. Anyway, so Ryan Herring doesn't come. I saw him. I showed up to the office. So you just walk into the office. First thing you say, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Kelby. That's the first words out of your mouth to him. Yeah. Yeah. That's crazy. He said it was fine. What do you mean he said it was fine? Did I mince my words? So you said [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] over Kel Kelby and he went thought about it and he was like you know no that's fine and that's what that's how the interaction what's your grievance this what is your grievance trying to get there but you have to start [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Donald Trump does to Ronda Santos he calls him Ron he calls him [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Ron and then he loses the election well meatball Ron needs Donald Trump's endorsement I don't need Kelby so you know what I mean you need Kelby I don't need you need him more needs you. Without him, what would you do? What would you talk about? Who would you would you bully? I guess the Batman does need a Joker. Yes, man. Anyway, so I basically Aiden has con he he cornered Brian at basketball rib shirt off. His mesh shirt. He was wearing a mesh shirt. Crazy. And uh and he to he basically convinced Brian to start coming into the office to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with me to basically stop me from achieving my goals. So now, so now, shut the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. So now what I have to do because the agreement was if if I want my own desk that is not just kind of like taking a space up that no one uses right now, I have to pay $200 a month, which is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy. I would never charge my friends anything and I have to buy $200 a month. So I did. I had to set up a new desk and I went and got it and I moved off of Brian Herren's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] territory like I'm a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Latin king and he's a pyou. Yeah. What are you talking about? And you're and he's a a talking about gang violence. He's an a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] gangster [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Mhm. And so I don't know what he's talking about anymore. So I have to do all this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] because you convinced a guy who is happily sitting at home in his underwear working to come into the office and that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. Is that true that you reach out to Brian to tell him to come here? No. No, it's just not. So, where do we go from there? It's totally fabricated. It's almost totally fabricated. When did When did the conversations about Sorry. Hold on. Let me look. The judge is here. Aiden, when did you first ask Brian about coming to Friday, which is after Slime had started coming into the office? Is it also after you mentioned this system to him where he would have to pay? No, it's before. It's And how many of Brian's shares are diluted? How many? 99%. Wait, how many of Slime's shares? 99%. Uh, so so you're saying before you ever mentioned it to him, you had talked to Brian? No. No. Absolutely not. So after you mentioned it to him, when he was told the original offer, Brian was still coming into the office a couple months ago. I I I brought up the the rent thing. Brian hasn't been in the office in maybe a month and a half, I would say. Right. Probably closer to two. And the offer the offer Well, the offer was given ages ago of whether or not he had to pay for a permanent desk or take advantage of empty spaces while they lasted. Now, what if on Friday? What if compromise? Please. You don't have to pay anything at all. But your desk is in here. In here? You already pay for this room. Where would we put it, Nick? Right on that wall. Right back there. Where the chairs are? Yeah, where the chairs are. That's a fire hazard. I could never I could never. I think that'd be dangerous. What if we put you in the house? I think personally it'd be dangerous. In your little closet. It's just literally here's what I think. First off, what if we put you in the What if we put you in the editor office downstairs? There's plenty of space in there for free. For free. No, he'd go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy. Cuz we know what slime was. He doesn't want that. We you think we know what you want. We know what you want. Huh? You don't want a desk to work. You want people to harass. No. I don't want people. Hey, if you don't want to charge me and you get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Kelby to take it downstairs and all my gear and put it downstairs and set it up, I'll take it. I'll stay out of your head. You want You want an anchor point that's within AOE range of people that actually work here. That is what you desire. I'm telling you right now you put me downstairs and you make Kelby [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] carry my my two monitors down there because that's not his job. That's what friends do for each other. Yeah, I'm office manager. You want the office manager to do it? Yes, I would have Christian do that. That would be his job if we had to move something. You don't like sending a message, do you? No. But what is he What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is he talking about? Exactly. There's no winning socks like Benjamin Franklin. He won't. That is Dude, that is crazy. What do you mean from unique that shirt? Two straps. Two straps under there. Yes, sir. In a metal pole. Anyway, I I maintain that he a part of him talking to Brian was about making him come in and making my life [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] miserable. I acknowledge that in the in the meeting. I think I maybe said verbatim because me and Brian were waiting for LD and we were I said Brian Brian you don't understand what Slime's done with your desk. Please, I'm begging you to come in. I think I said on it. What are you talking about done with it? I I I look I'm a great negotiator. I just finished hard of the deal. So I have a deal for you. Yeah, sure. You can work up here rentree, but you have to either fill yourself or give the money to fill Bosu coffee. I knew you know what I I thought about this on the drive. I was like I sipped a lot of his coffee. His coffee. I mean, that's the thing you tax is the offic's resources. And you love you love cracking open containers and drinking most of them. Have our own. You could go in here. I mean, sure. So, I'm saying I'm saying we'll fill it for you. We'll get it. We'll keep it stocked. I want to also point out, notice how there's only one man on trial here, but there's a man sitting to his left, my right, that has also started working upstairs in the office recently. Also, who also doesn't work at Mogul, but but I'm not breaking the law. But but he's not breaking any laws. Well, actually, a welcome member to the environment. I actually do have a problem with Nick, too. Let's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hear it again. Apparently Nick, cuz I listened to the premium episode, was pulling up thousands of instances of the n-word that in the office. That didn't happen in the office. That didn't happen here. It didn't happen here. No, that happened at home. I'm sorry. So then he's just a guy who pulls up slurs at home. If you I just don't know if that's what I do off of company time is not your problem. uh your concern. Yeah, if you don't know, it's in the premium episode, but Nick was coding and then one of the one of the codes I found old Call of Duty code that I needed to use, but the person who wrote it had used the nword as a custom function like is that syntax? Thousands and thousand syntax is like the the whole string of all and uh and uh and we had a an ethical quandry, you know, can I use the code? Do I have the pass to use the code? We determined probably not. Um, but I didn't do that on work hours. I didn't do anything to be honest. I just opened it. Well, the thing about I just played the Lil Wayne song. I didn't, your honor. Your honor, I ended at 6' 7 foot. Yeah. And then and then you showed up today and you said I am going to dress like a founding father. It's just long. It's just my shorts or my pants. If these were lower, it's all right, man. Now you don't care. Four years ago. Go a summer in France and sleep with many beautiful women. Me and Aiden have like the same socks on except his says Balenciaga. Is that why you don't like you're wearing like these like loafers that Sure. There's a vibe happening made by like a you know a child in the street. Your shirt. You have a Tanack shirt on and it's money. It's money. It is money. Okay. Well, I guess I can't wear truck fit jeans and don't act like before this. I'm ling out. Okay. I'm mad now. That's what it's like to be me all the time. Yeah. Have that anger. It's good to be It's good to be in good standing. I feel comfortable. bomb against. Anyway, me and Aiden were forever beefing until he [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] until he fixes this problem. And I know he doesn't care, but I'll make his life [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] miserable. That's all. 70° if you guys are wondering. 65 BPM. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Should I bring my Apple Watch in? I'm an Apple Watch guy now. Bring mine in. Are we all just kidding? Oh, wait. Did you just Why Why did you get this? I got Cuz I'm trying to run. I'm I'm back on the freaking marathon train. I'm back. So, was yesterday running for running for 2 minutes and then you'll run for 3 minutes? No, I'm done with [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] training. Like, run one more minute every day. I'm I'm just running. What was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about that? Well, I thought it was good because you just added one more minute every day. It got it got bad by about minute 40 or that was when it got rough. So, 41 you're like, "Ah." Yeah. When you do 39 to 40 to 41, you're like, "Oh, damn." Give me a break. What if we hung some awesome mochi from a string in front of you? Would you run forever? Does it have freaking show's face on it? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. It's just snarling at it trying to reach it. You got eaten alive for thinking he's more famous than Jack Black. It's the most push back we've ever gotten. Wait, what? Yeah. Really? No, I stand on that. Joe is more famous than Jack Black. No way, dude. We can't rehash. I'm only saying this. I actually have evidence anecdotal, but uh I was with my sister this weekend and I said, "H show Otani." My sister's very athletic. She doesn't watch baseball, but she like she's like plays soccer and all that stuff. She says, "Who's that?" No way. She's never heard of it. But lesbian and she's watch a lesbian. So interesting. Yeah. And famously, they do not recognize the nation of Japan. Yes. They don't know. They've never heard of it. But I think they do know baseball players. I think it comes in the same DLC pack. You learn every baseball player's name. Uh, you can bench press slightly more. Maybe more. I can tell you the softball goat. Yeah, probably. I don't know a softball player. Maybe that's Yeah. Anyone name a soft, weirdly enough. Show Otani. He dominates. He probably would. He would do quite well. I think he'd be a good softball. No, I actually don't think I could name a soft. Damn, that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. Could you name a women's basketball player? Caitlin Clark. Go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yourself. It was I am surprised. I I'm actually like impressed that he I'm surprised he learned that before Messi. She was in the crossword. So that's how I got really the full thing. Caitlyn Clark. No, Clark. Yeah. And then I was like, "Oh, right." And I've heard her name obviously and that's that. Slime's been doing this thing with the crossword where he finds questions that he think I he thinks I should know the answer to and if I don't immediately know the answer, he calls me a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] idiot and asks, "What am I? Do you want to know the one he didn't know? Please. It was I couldn't get I probably don't know it either. You probably don't. Oh, there's the lemonade stand next to I didn't even back that up. I didn't need him to double down on what I said. I said it already. You have to be like, you probably don't. Wait. Oh, yeah. You don't. Uh, he doesn't even remember last. He's so Well, cuz I was looking at the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] screenshot of the Lemonade Stand podcast with a big swastika and then Lewig's face next to it. Oh, yeah. Anyway, that's real. Yeah, dude. I thought someone made it on the subreddit and I was like banned them for making it, but it's a slide where Atriox explaining like how how World War II affected tariffs and he's like there's and he's like there's the Axis powers and then it's U3 photoshopped as the three generals of the Axis. Did you know this? Uh you know what? I actually listened to Lemonade Stand and I heard you guys laugh but you never explained the picture cuz you're not good podcasters. Bad podcasters. Interesting. podcast years. I know something we need to get better about. Honest to God, I thought it was Aean. I have a whole new level of self-consciousness. Hundredths of a Swedish crona. Three words or three letters. What? Hundreds of hundredths of a Swedish crona. Oh, so what is the penny called in the Swedish currency? It's like the the denomination is so small you never use it. He just didn't know. And then and then he didn't find out. And then I told him the answer. What's the denomination of the yen? smaller yen. But does it go lower than the yen? I thought it was just called yen. Well, that's what it mean. But that's the you know how we have dollars and cents. Ichien. Anyway, what was it for? What was it? It's it's o r e or I had no idea. Uh yeah, Christian's a a cross word fiend. Oh, really? Yeah. I mean, I just do it for slop for my mind. It's slop. It's word slop. Is it slop when it's like old people? Like if a grandma's doing it, is it slop? Yeah. Yeah. They're g It's What makes it slop? Isn't it good for you? You would think so, but I've been trying to write more lately and I looked at some older writing and I'm like, dude, I was way more clever and now I feel really rusty. And if you're if you're doing crosswords, it's like, well, that should help. And I don't think it has. I watched too much the Elrand of Time randomizers. I think it is funny. It is funny to be like, I should get better at writing. I'll do crosswords. It's like more like I should get better at basketball. play 2K. Yeah, it's more like it's it will help you a little bit more than playing Elden Ring, right? Sure. Yeah, it's it does have word. Hold on. What is What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is this? What? Dude, you have a Yeah, this is the sample. This is our [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Okay. I thought you bought that. There's a big tag on the back. No, it's a sample. Like he's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Woody in a in a toy store. Pull it. Don't pull that. Pull it. Anyway, uh I almost got in a fight at basketball. It was my first almost real fight. Was it you in stands? No, I thought it was No, it was with a stranger. That that happens almost every week. By the way, this is not a surprise. Can I say that Aiden gets heated when he plays basketball. Oh, yeah. Too heated, maybe. Oh, you get heated. I would say too heated. I was heated as Stans. Stans has a different level. Stan Stans Stans has a sense of justice that he seeks and if he sees something, break it. He gets really hot. Aiden just gets hot when he's competitive. M. So you say no. Oh, the things you were saying to those CSGO CS2 randoms on train. I don't want to hear it. When you're trying your heart out, you don't like people to interrupt that. Yeah. Oh, absolutely. So, what happened with this guy? With this uh paint picture. In pickup basketball, the way it works at these courts is you have to somebody has to call next for like the next group of five to replace the losing team. You're putting your quarter down. Yeah. And uh I had five uh five people. We had just lost and we get off and presumably we're all playing together again. I know this because I've asked the people and then I say we got next and one of our guys is off further away and I haven't talked to him but I'm just assuming he'll be our fifth for this game. A guy you don't know. I don't know any of these people. Okay. But the fifth guy is over on the other side of the court with his friend. And I'm like I assume he'll play with us. Uh and then we wait like 25 usually wait like 25 30 minutes for the next game to start. We step out onto the court, our whole team walks out, there's six guys, and everybody's like, "Oh, wait. What's going on?" Like, "Why do we have six people?" And one of the people, the guy who was further away with his friend says, "My friend's here. We called next. We're we're playing right now." And I'm like, "No, you can't you can't do that. We said we're all playing together and you didn't say anything. You can't just sneak somebody in." Yeah. Oh, so you're a squad of four and man's wanted his man to man. Mans wanted a man. And he may have said like I have next but didn't specify two people. Exactly. And he never talked to us or came over to our side of the court. It smell like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] when he walks. And he's in he keeps saying that he called. Do it smell like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] or didn't smell like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yet. Okay. And he's insisting that he called next and one of his other friends that comes a lot is is backing him up on it. And I'm and I'm like, "No, that doesn't make any sense. you can't just pull your friend in. We have six people. Like, you have to sit out or he has to sit out. And he's like, "No, you have to sit out." And and now I'm I'm mad that I have done everything correctly. You know, this is the Aiden. This is I've done everything right. I'm getting punished. And I'm also mad that as the guy who stepped up to say something, cuz the other three people aren't saying anything. They're just waiting for this resolve because I've said something. I'm now the one that is expected to give up my spot. That's crazy. That doesn't seem right. And I'm like, I'm not going to do that. You can't just you. And this guy, my big frustration is like he knows what he did. He intentionally didn't speak to anybody. He tried to sneak his friend in and now he's insisting that he gets to make the team and that I have to sit out. And I'm like, I'm not sitting out. This is stupid. There are other people around us except for his friends who think he's in the right. Everybody else is gener I would say generally on my side, but you know what they care about more than this argument. They care about playing basketball. So people start suggesting that we shoot for it. But I'm frustrated. I I'm not going to shoot for it. This is not the way you do this. I've been in the other seat before. What you do when your friend comes to play and there's a bunch of other people that are waiting, you wait for the next game after that. And I do that all the time when I come with friends. And is there a part of you that was you didn't want to shoot for it because losing would [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] suck? Of course, because then I have to sit out for another 30 minutes if I lose that and I shouldn't have to shoot at all. Sure, but it it like in my in the gambler's mind, it's like let's shoot for it and like and you kind of like mog. It's it's just anti to the principle of the situation. All right. So, which is my big my big problem with it. And uh as this is kind of he is insisting that he called it and he's getting more frustrated that I'm not just accepting and like stepping out and I'm like no you can't do this. It's like you can't and and then he starts to get angry and then I start to get angry and then from experience at basketball something the men at basketball don't like very much is you call them soft. It makes people very angry. And I think that's hilarious because the amount the reactions you get when you call somebody [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] soft at basketball is insane. People are so I I think they're very fragile about their masculinity. And I I admittedly I like poking the bear a little bit. Oh, she's a man. So I I I said like you can't just do like you can't do do this. like you're and then at some point in this conversation I say, "Dude, stop being so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] soft about this." And then and then a silence echoes over the part. He And then he whips around because he's trying he won't make eye contact me with the whole time. He's looking ahead and he won't look at me when he's arguing with me. And then he turns around, he's like, "What did you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] say to me? You call me [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] soft." And he and he comes up in my face. And I'm like, "Yeah, you're being [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] soft right now." Let's go. And then and then he comes he walks up to me and shoulder checks me and he so he whips me in the chest with his with his shoulder. How tall is this man? He come dude dead ass. He probably like his head probably comes up to my mouth. Like five 510. He's probably like 57 or 58. Oh the top of his head. Yeah. Yeah. He's he's shorter than guy. and he he hits me and in my head I'm like, "Dude, this is so like it's so sick cuz in my head I want and I look at him and and I say, "Do it, man." Like like and uh cuz I'm angry and I think it's really funny that he's hit me basically. Yeah. You've also you've won the interaction so hard because he got so mad that he like didn't even swing on you. He did the the high school like Yeah. Yeah. you know, and he he but he contacted you and you're like, "Yeah, right here. Come on." And he's a he's a shorter but like strong guy and I'm tall and skinny, right? Like I'm not I'm not confident. This is how they set up fights in Street Beast. I'm not exact. I to be honest I think I'd probably lose the fight. Like I I I it's not really about You s You've soul read him. You soul read and you're like he's not he's not about it. Yeah. But in my mind taking a swing ever. Yeah. Not Not like in my adult life. No. Uh, are you trying to let's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] take it to the yard after this. Take it to the yard. Uh, so all of this D and the problem is he he has his friend and he won't cave. He will not leave and I'm not going to cave. But I can see how impatient everybody else is getting in this interaction even though people are on my side. So I'm like, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it. This I'm m I'm super mad, but I'm like I'll shoot for it. So I take it and I drain my three. Let's go. Oh my god. So crucial first try and then he shoots and he doesn't he's super short. Like he hits like the front of the rib and he's like so and I'm like there it is. It's like come on let's play that. Yeah. And so he walks off the court with his friend and then I this is this is my problem. It's like in my head cuz I'm still angry that I had to resolve. I'm I'm angry that I had to shoot and in my mind this whole thing is so stupid. It's like you tried to cheat basically. I would never do that in your position and I know that because I never do. And then the game starts and I I I like but I'm checking the ball up and I look over at him and I'm like, "Hey man, hey man, make sure you call next." But now but now I've lost because he gets really upset and he starts walking towards me and his friends are like trying to hold him back and then everybody else I've I've like lost the court of public. They're like, "All right, now he's being a dick." the core. Like I I know every pretty much everybody I play with there. Like I even know the guy who got mad at me like through showing up all the time and everybody's like, "Come on, man. Now you're instigating. Like now you're trying to make him mad." Like and I'm like, "Yep, you're like you're totally right. Like I'm crossing the line. I already got I already got everything like I wanted, right? And I'm trying to make him more mad." You know, you know what I should do? You should listen to our advice episode we did yesterday about Oh my god, we did a whole section on this. Getting mad. Hey, so I'm 5 foot seven and I got this. I got mobbed by a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] guy who's really into Swedish. And I called next quietly for my friend. Uh, did you win that game? And uh, my team Yeah, my team did win that game only and I got sucked off on a quarter. He comes with a group of people all the time that are his close homies and I I play with a lot. They're uh, and I I feel end of the game like I feel bad. I go up to him like, "Hey, man. I'm sorry. That was too far." And he was like, "Yeah, man. Like it was over." And then what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you saying something to me about? Go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yourself. And the I would say the nice thing about basketball at least at these courts is like people actually squash pretty quick like when anything comes up cuz I don't I contrary to the narrative I don't this does not happen very often. Uh like it's happened it's happened twice big ass. I and when I and when I say it happens often first off I mean it. Second off it's usually people you know and it's very quick. It's funny cuz every time I hear a beef story, he's in the beef story. I know the interaction grid is crazy. It's only having three. Well, it's only it's having three total and you've been in all of them. It's like a drop of water in a hot pan, you know? It It sizzles, but it go away quick. It goes away quick. And you usually chop it up. So I that was basically the whole thing is I I've never I it's funny because I think I get like this in video games and I think uh I just have a strong sense of justice like stance and it's like things should be done in a certain way because I think I respect people's time and uh I mean I'm honestly like you you should hear when nobody entries on Nuke, bro. You should hear him talk. See the important thing is I play I played with Squeeze this week. Breath of fresh air. That man knows how to play Counter-Strike. He's just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] amazing. He's good. He probably has some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to say about you. About me? Yeah, I imagine. Ask him. I'm a good teammate. No, they were they were it was love birds. He was amazing. They were I just the way what Aiden was saying on the mic, I can only imagine it was heavenly. The be the beauty though, Aiden, is is until from the eyes of a spectator, until you shot for it, everyone was just like, I don't know. They're just arguing this is dumb. But because you made your shot, it doesn't matter what happens after that. They could have all jumped you and you still win. Yeah, cuz that guy's been remember forever. The nerd that he hated at the court took the shot and hit. He was wet, dude. He must have been so embarrassed. That is so awesome. His he was he was like shaking. It was It was funny because like I I I'm not an intimidating I don't think I'm an intimidating person at all. And his girl was there, but I'm just I'm just confrontational and I'm also not good at fighting. like I would I would probably lose the fight. It's also like you know you're 30, right? Like getting in a in a spot like this is is always embarrassing. It's like oh god what are we doing? It was funny cuz his close friend who was backing him up on him calling next who played on the other team in the game was like uh uh we we talked about it a bit after like I made one of the first shots and he's just like yeah man you settle it on the court like and he that's why everybody's so quick to like to to let it cool off. So sure. Also they just want to play damn basketball. Damn people just want to play. Uh oh. And then I got my karma. I got my karma cuz I played for two more hours and then I got my I sprained my ankle and it's all bruised and swollen and I So Oh yeah, you missed basketball this week cuz it's all gross. You're trying to come back too quick, too. H You're trying to come back too quickly. I'm not I'm going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that. You know what? Thank you for telling me your facial weakness. Oh. Mhm. I think we should all punch each other in the face. Okay. All right. Sure. Ooh, it is. That's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. Wait, are you seeing that purple? That looks really bad, actually. Wait, it's soidenidoners. Don't look. No. No. Show that camera. Purple and yellow. Yeah, you really did [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it up, huh? It It looks like it's going to fall off. Give me a little zoom in on that. Maybe. I don't think it will, but it looks like it. That is so much worse. I got it checked. It looks ugly as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] It Okay, it hurt a little bit. Genuinely disgusting. Hey, you know what? Come on. Don't talk with your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] black toe, dude. That shit's nasty. Don't bring up the black toe. You know he's sensitive about the black toe. literally has stink lines when he takes off his face. It [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] looks like a Spongebob close up. You know when Spongebob Yeah. when like he like eats too much ice cream. It's got the green bumps on it and like the stench. That's what your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] look like. Whatever, dude. Man, you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Do you really think we should all punch each other? Who do you Who do you want? We shouldn't all do everyone, right? Well, okay. I think it's important to be punched. To be punched just to know what the punch is like. Sure. And so you might as well get punched by someone you love. Do you? Sure. And I did this, but it's Have you been punched? Well, I did this exact thing in college. It's been 10 years. I have gear in my car right now. I with the head thing. You mean punch? Do you mean punch with fists or punch with like in boxing? In college, my me and my friend Anders would punch each other. Kissing on each other. And we'd practice We would practice punching first, right? And then with our swollen lips. You'd have to make it all better. We kiss like the Kardashian kiss. Uh, we would punch each other in the damn face and we'd increase power. We'd we'd punch and be like 20%. How where in the head were you hitting our face? Like nose? Like Yeah. Okay. So, like a one of these? Yeah, sure. Punch to the face. I suck. I have mouth guards, too. I just want to lose a tooth. Skip all that. I don't want to lose a tooth on some dumb [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] So, that's that's just being responsible. You got to be responsible. I may I may have brought it up. I don't remember. But when I went to my high school reunion like a few months ago or whatever, uh I confronted the guy who punched me in high school. I was like I was like remember when he punched me and he's like nah I don't remember that mugs at all. He was in front of his like girlfriend he punched me in high school in the face for no reason. She was like why? He's like I didn't do that. Didn't happen. That's crazy. I'm like I didn't make this up. It never happened. I don't know. So anyway, we do it to each other. Okay. I would want to punch Nick. Why me? I think Nick, who do you want to punch? I want to punch Slime. What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Slime, who do you want to punch? Well, you have to punch Aiden. I have to punch Aiden. He can punch you. So, wait. I can't get Well, no, cuz it needs to be chain, right? Be a chain. Cuz if he punches me, who's punching Aiden? Does that mean I punch? Punch Aiden. Aiden punches himself. Aiden punches himself. Uh, if I punch Aiden, he's not coming to the next episode. That's the problem. No. One swing. Maybe not. He Maybe not. He goes sleep. Do you still have it like that? I mean, I know how to throw punch, but you But you before you would sleep any woman. Yeah. Rodrigo, you you used to say you could sleep any woman and Aiden in one punch. I'm wondering if you said to be clear, I never said that. Um, now I'm wondering if you think it would take you multiple to sleep any woman like you said. I don't think I've lost any strength. Have the women gotten stronger? No, nothing has changed. Love it. The women the women have gotten stronger. Olivia Rodrigo wants to get in the ring with a guy like me, I will I will [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] her up. I don't know what to tell. I don't know what to I just don't know what to say, but that'll never happen. Those are crash. I just want I'm sorry. It's true. I don't want to do this, but I would sleep Olivia Rodrigo. Yes. All right. Gun to his head. He He would He does it. He gets the job done. That's just the way it is, man. We should do the yard boxing, but we should make all our fans fight and then we're the refs. But it should be like king of the ring. So it's like not like we set up the fights. You just have one in the middle and it's like who wants it? Who wants it? And then they come in. We don't check anything. We just throw them in. You remember Swank? Hillary. Lewank. Yes. Yeah. One of the Lwig old heads. He's an Indiana melee player and he was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] gigantic, bro. He was a stacked man. He was he was probably like one of the biggest men I've ever met in real life. And I just imagine like what if we have like a swank out there and like the god's strongest yard warrior. We definitely have someone who's enormous. If you're on trend, can we get like a like a Archie or Ben? We need like a Discord server to see who's the biggest yard. Just post on post on the subreddit if you feel big. If you feel if you think you're big, if you feel big, you need to have a yard logo in the picture. There's going to be somebody who's just enormous. A yard logo in the picture. Whether you draw it, print it, wear it, it's just got to be in the photo. Got to take your nuts out. Blur that though. The yard take your nuts out challenge. The yard. Go to the sub. #pull the bag out. Your nuts. Let's go bag. #beat it like Lwig. Yeah. # jerkit like augren challenge. #my balls are normal size. Dude, I've been driving a Chevy Silverado. Is that what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] That's who that is. It's a giant electric Chevy Silverado. It's like ice blue. It's like a Gatorade. I've been driving a Chevy Silverado. It's It's massive. And I've never especially It's all-wheel drive. Yeah, it's No, not we're not sponsored yet, but it's not an ad, so say something about it. Comfortably fits the whole family. Disparage it now. 400 miles per charge. I'm getting there. Okay, I'm getting there. It's a It's a big car. It's electric. Okay, cool. and uh and it's for a shoot coming up, but they wanted to give it to me ahead of time to get some reps with it. So, I've been driving it everywhere. So, right. But there's some there's some small streets in LA. There's some narrow streets that are two ways, but they're they feel like one ways. People park on each side, too. Yes. And so, I'm in one of those streets in this car and and then I meet what what lo and behold, another [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Ford F-150. Big ass truck. Uh, you give him a little nod. And well, no, cuz we are trying to go opposite directions and one of us has to buckle. Dude, you one of us has to buckle in reverse. This is like Aiden situation. This is exactly drive. You have to go fast and furious. Yeah. What the hell does that mean? The scene where Vin Diesel and they're just driving their cars at each other and then they just gay chicken and they don't give up. Yeah. Uh well in on the streets the the word of law is that downhill has the right of way. Is it flat surface though? It probably is easily tell if you can ever you know check the yaw even if there's a little downhill and checking getting the level out of your right downhill. If the person going downhill is right away. Okay. So I was going downhill but they weren't buckling. They were staying there. That's what you get out of the car. You downhill and I thought I saw a place they could exit right to. So I was like waiting for them to do it and they didn't do it. And so and so I went into the spot but it didn't give them enough room. Sure. Cuz like they would have had to gone like Japanese direction past me. Ah I basically went to the you have to go Japanese direction. Of course I know what that means. And so then I reverse it and then he honks at me. What? And then and then I just put you I do this. You put it in park. I do I put in park. I do this. That's badass. We all had confrontations. I do this. Wow. Okay. What he do? He backs his ass off. Let's go, dude. cuz he wants to get somewhere. And I had more time on him. I had more time. And I had a giant Chevy Silverado. You think if you got out you could take him? You see him? You uh He was older. His car was very nice. It had like a carbon fiber hood. He was like 63. Oh, you're you're killing him. I probably could have taken him. He probably could have maybe sued me or put a bullet through your brain and explo white collar crimemed me out of existence. Yeah, that's cool. He could not white collar crime you. He looked like he could have white collar crimes you, it's going to be yourself. It's kind of already happened in a way. I know, right? What? What? White collar crimeing yourself? How have I white collar crime myself? Well, you've gotten close. I've never white collar crime myself. But you've gotten close. We've grazed it. Damn this watch. I know. It's annoying, right? How does it shut up? Did you just turn off all the beeps? I only have mine showing my heart rate. That's all I use it for. I need the beeps to stop. I'm getting the uh I'm just getting constant notifications of cutie asking Gingley how to work a shower. Black mirror. Black mirror logo on top of this. the technology. Stop hitting it. It's not going to work. God. Okay. New Black Mirror. Anyone want to watch New Black Mirror? That [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is ass. It is the most It is the most butt poop TV in a long time. That is like I I'm like watching it and I'm like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are they thinking? All I know is Tommy in it is in it. He is. No, I haven't gotten there. I'm in it. Black Mirror. He's in it um in a spaceship. I don't know. Bad guy is what? Let's go. Is he trying to be an actor? He's trying to be a comedian, too, right? I don't think he was an actor or sorry, that's not fair to say. I don't think he had a line. A what? A line. Was he like Was he cameo? Was he a creator on like a computer screen or something? A line like a I didn't watch how they do a Pokemon in like the freaking It does kind of suck to be like the top of your field. Look up Tommy in it black mirror to be like the top of your field. Just look up Tommy in it black. Let me see. Let me see that. Yeah. Yeah. Can I get a hat wobble? To get to become like a blue chip creator like the top of your field like the Pokemon mains and the Valkyries of the world and at the end of the day in like traditional Hollywood media you are reduced to like a cameo. Yeah. So we want to put you on a screen basically. We want you to say you're images. No way my man. That's badass. And as DanTDM on the left, who's that? He's just another Minecraft creator. He looks old as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] It looks like he put him old as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] comparatively. Is DanTDM younger than me? No, I think DanTDM's older than you. That's crazy. I know. There's still time. Well, he just turned 56. Well, if there's a chance that we could put that The yard would maybe go in Black Mirror season 8, I personally I love this season. I think that uh it's approaching dystopia in an awesome new way. Even though it's seven seasons, if they offered it, you shouldn't take it. Why? Cuz it just it's going to be bad. No, you don't want to be part of something stinky. It's No, it would be awesome. As a as a novelty, I don't think you lose anything. You only pump out bangers. Yeah. To be in something that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lame once is kind of funny. And the Black Mirror is your phone. So, like, okay, if you had the opportunity to do a cameo in a Brent Rivera YouTube video, would you do it? Yeah. May I ask who that is? Yeah. I want to eat slime. He's a He's a a kids YouTuber who makes videos that get like 10 to 20 million views. What if it's King Zippy? Who's that? Did I Were you here when I showed you guys? I don't know if he was here. No. Uh it's a Can you just really quick King Zippy Fortnite? Okay. Yeah. What if it's King Sketches? Yeah. No. That's cool because it's six hours. That's what makes King Zippy cool. If you had a cameo, no one would know. You'd be so buried in it. Yeah. Well, imagine the cross of the ven diagram of like a guy who watches the yard and also watches King Zippy. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy. We were talking about this with uh me and Huey, one of our Oz Melee friends was visiting and we were talking about the crossover between the yard and Bundon and how it's when we talk about Bundon basically he's so big but nobody in our audience seems to know who he is and it's like that's how separated those like age group. It's also weird though too like cuz shorts uh viewers are so uh they don't even know the damn person sometimes. Everyone's pumping out long form low Roblox videos now and they're popping off. Really? Yes. He's a Roblox YouTuber now. Hold up. Zipper, can you look up Bundon? Roblox. I love when Ludwig gets to crack open the Bundon like like a like AI robot face YouTube. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Dude, he mogs Ludwig. He clearly does very well. Can you go to video? Well, only 29. Holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bro. He's I let a Roblox kid control my stream for 700K views. Dude, Bund's making lot of money, dude. What does this mean? I let a Blox fruit admin train me. What does that mean? Wait, I streamed until Do that one. Uh, 2 million. I stream until I beat Roblox's hardest game. Dude, is there a shame being a kid entertainer but pretending you're not? Uh, yeah, 100%. Anytime you pretend he's pretending he's not, though. Uh, I think he is. I think Lewig does, too. Oh, wait. What? So, you think I'm a kids YouTuber? I I think the Do you think you're a kids YouTuber? I don't think so. Oh, wow. That's brave. That's fun. That's brave of him to say that. We have a totally separate audience on the yard. They don't They don't know about this Ludwig thing. It's just the kids who watch that. I do. I don't think I think about this. But like your biggest like Amazon stream videos Uhhuh. Do you like what do you think the demo is? Uh I think I think it's consistent. I don't think it's like changing wildly if it's an Amazon stream or if it's tipto tip or if it's Do you think there's a difference if you started doing Roblox content is clearly like for children? Uh look I don't this is a bad thing. I haven't watched his video and I'm not going to but I don't know if I could do Roblox like genuinely. Sure. You'd have to love it. I've never played. Is this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] awesome? Roblox is awesome. Yeah, of course it's awesome. But the issue is everyone who watches Roblox is a child for sure. And that means everyone who you're playing against is a child. Uh yeah, it's just a different level. Tiger Woods. Did he just fling Tiger Woods head at him? It's Tiger Uppercut from Sag. This is the coolest [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ever joke. Oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dude. Yeah, he was I think Bundon knows. What is this projectile audience? I don't think a kid made the joke. You know what I'm saying? No, I think an adult developed this. Yeah. Well, adults are the Yeah, of course. I think kids are also developing though. Yeah, but like uh Roblox development is just like a huge ecosystem. Like people are making millions. I wish kids liked COD 4. They play COD 4 in Roblox. Yeah, they have COD 4 and Roblox. Let me see. COD 4 and Roblox. I need to see it. Yeah, you can look up Call of Duty Roblox. That's the thing. It's like all the all the games we thought were sick growing up have just been remade in Roblox. I don't buy this. I think maybe look up uh Call of Duty 4 instead of COD 4. No one calls it Call of Duty 4. No one calls it COD 4 Call of Duty Roblox. But I I Well, anyway, I I think his audience is is not kids. It's not really kids. I just love that slime lives in this world. So correct at the moment. Well, I I look, I spoke too soon without thinking, but I I I do think that the I don't know. I the demographic can't be that old. Or is it? I think tip to tip is way different. That's like it just isn't though cuz it's like the same channel. There's a lot of returning viewers. I mean, it can be slightly different, but like the additional viewers aren't changing the core. Maybe think about this. Somebody could be 15 years younger than you and they're not a kid. It's true. That's crazy. I know. Yeah. You really shouldn't have put it that way. I said the other day, a good way to put it, dude. What when does kids start? Is it 12? Well, like when I say kids are watching Bundon, his viewers are like age 10 to 14 and maybe younger. I think kid is technically 0 to 17. That's kid. No, I think kid is when you teen is not kid, right? Teen's a kid. It depends. No, but it's not. The 15-year-old is not watching toy unboxing. Seven-year-olds are. And that's the difference. That's a huge difference. I think a a kids toy and a and a toy for teens. I guess teen toy. I think Careful now. I didn't want to say that. Toys for teens. They we've drawn a few lines. So like COPA copa is like the child's whatever protection act. Yeah. That is for under 13. So that's what the line they drew. Okay. So it's like 13 is the line. Kids under that age. They don't have Keen in their name. Just draw a 12. That's what I'm saying. It's 0 to 12 is kid or a child, I guess. And then 13 up is like adolescent. Yeah. I think you should make it zero to 15. I think we should be a kid till we're 26 and we shouldn't have to work either. But maybe we can went car earlier. Do you think Lwig there is an age that someone reaches and they say I watch Lewig and that might feel embarrassing among their peers like old be too old for Lewig? No. You don't think so? No. I think that's actually the the true litmus test. if like if someone doesn't feel embarrassed by listening or watching your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] which is why I I feel comfortable about our show cuz it's like I feel you can listen to this as like, you know, as up to up to the age of me, which is probably our upper limit. Our show isn't the age, it's if you're not a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] white dude, it's embarrassing. If you're a woman and you listen to the yard, it's a little shout out. Our woman fans are fervent and they are loyal. Yeah, I'm It's embarrassing for them. They probably don't go to the girly circles and go, "I just listened to They have to be like, I know what they have to preface. They have to preface like they're watching an anime with [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] porn in it." I feel it's good, but it's good. But the first episode has this like whole scene and it's I I promise it's not all the Baldwin's funny, but he comes off aggressive and horny. The nicely dressed one's going to be the funny one, though. You'll get there. I'm wearing a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tanack shirt. I'm trying to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm trying to change my image by having a tampon wearing tampons. I acknowledge that tampons exist. That's not something that people didn't think you Thank you very much. Thank you, men. And why are there different sizes? I don't know. What are the different sizes? Is one for a butt? Can you name him? Name the different sizes of tampons. Butt. Biggest. You're wearing a tampon shirt. Give There's none of them for butt. That can't be true. Butts leak. Just give me a couple names for size like a sizing chart. Plus Yeah. Unfortunately, you've got uh you got Muffster, dude. I was watching Super last night. Someone in the chat was like was like, "You know, Super with that haircut gets no snizz." And he was like, "Snizz." And I'm like, "That is gross. That's that's a new one. I don't like that." So that's that's a new uh tampon size. Tampon size is is for amount of flow. Amount of flow. It's amount of flow. Heavy. Medium, light, heavy. Kind of like Street Fighter buttons. That's correct. Yeah. That's where Street Fighter got it from. Yeah. And then you can get the EX tampons, but you have to spend bar for it. It's tough. It's tough. It's invincible on wake up. You use too many EX tampons, you start bleeding out your nose. What's the water line? Uh the water line. Yeah. Hold on. One more. Uh I I put that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in block stun. Okay. Nah. Come on. [Laughter] Over here. Ding ding ding. Good job. Yeah. I don't know, man. I feel like it's more likely to go the other way. Like the example you were giving, I feel like if you if you're in sixth grade and you're hanging out with your friends and you tell them you watch Lewig, it more might be more embarrassing in that context than it would for somebody older. Yeah, I think it there's a lot of context in which you can be embarrassed by saying I watch X or Y. Sometimes it's online where everyone can kill you for any reason. Sometimes it's among your similar peers. sometimes among older people. Um, but that's I think that's the litmus test. Is this content embarrassing at X age? And if it's no age, then you're kind of cruising. But I think Bundon stuff, it's like he's making Roblox videos. And if you're 27 and you're watching a Bundon Roblox video, Yeah. you might give it might give you pause. Oh, I think so. And that's okay. It's just not. I remember a girl I was dating, she was like really embarrassed to confess to me that she watched Minecraft like like Minecraft YouTube, casual Minecraft like for kids. I think I watched Minecraft YouTube until I was like 17. Yeah, but that's that's the kid line. If you told the boys that in when in high school, would you be embarrassed? Would they roast you for it? Or were the boys also pumped about the new texture pack syndicate? Was I could ask one one of my boys from high school's here. I could ask him. Yeah, you could. I could go see. I I feel like I feel it's okay to like what you like. You shouldn't be embarrassed to like it. No, you shouldn't. But there is a culture of like making fun of choosing what style what your content says about you is personal taste and making fun of that. That's like how the world works. And you can't just ignore that either. I ignore it. I was I ignore it. I didn't give up about all that. Ignore it. I hate this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] thing. Dude, you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] freaking out. It's tilting me. He got mad. He called me an idiot. He was so cruel to me. He came in with his pastries and his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up chass hair and he made some bird's gone already. I'm so impressed by it. I'm telling you, I tan quick. Okay, next. He tweeted out, "What are cardio zones?" What an idiot. Who are you talking to? Yeah, it was crazy. They were dumb as hell. What are cardio zones? Slime tweeted out. He just asked that. Is he dumb as hell? Slime. Slime tweeted out. He's like, "Can you pull up son's Twitter?" You got to bookmark, surely. He was like, "What? What are what are what are I said our cardio zones cap? I just figured out about them." Figured out what? And I still have it. What are they? Oh, is he not the chop? You're the chop does for going to Twitter to ask the question. Can I intuit it? Can I try? Does it have to do with the level of your heart rate? Yeah. Like your you enter a new zone when your heart rate passes a certain threshold, right? And what do those zones mean in those zones that they are right? Like why do we distinct wish between them? To be honest with you, I thought this was going in more of a CrossFit direction like, "Oh, I'm going to cardio zone this week." Oh, like a place to get like your heart replaced like youth zone. Okay. Yeah, the the zones are just like basically uh like amount of effort based off I think your resting heart rate tweeting too much. and general fitness that bad. Are cardiozones for losing weight cap or real? I just found out about them. I just think that's a Google. I But I like the idea of people. The reason why I ask on Twitter is to get people's thoughts and their anecdotal experiences. I think that's interesting and also important about something I'm thinking about but not like trying to solve a real problem. You want to make sure that they keep their Twitter jobs because they're getting outsourced. Cardio zones are more important for the health of your heart than for weight loss. It's not I mean that's not like the point. It's more like if you're in zone 2, you're burning fat as a resource in your body. If you go up in zones, you start burning carbs and protein because your body's really trying to like it's using a much more accessible source. So that's like the the idea, but it's more of a minmax thing and it's kind of cap. Uh it at the end of the day, you just want your heart to be healthy. So if I tweet, don't eat pastries. Is more RAM better for my computer? Is that cap? I think would that be chill? Yeah, that'd be fine because you're asking an honest question. You're like I I think being vulnerable and saying I don't really know about this. Can Can I get people to talk to me about it? Maybe you get called dumb because you like maybe RAM should be more obvious to you, but maybe not. I think it's still fine to ask. Nick Enger earlier asked me um how do I tell what lens I have on a camera? And I thought he meant like, you know, he has a picture and he wants to know like what lens the picture was taken from, but he actually was just holding the lens like like a detached lens that's like like on a camera and he just it was covered in the text that says what the lens is. It says the brand. It says all the numbers. He could have read it. He could have just looked at the lens. He sent me a picture of it. So I just read the numbers back there. Dude, that's my go wait. You know, maybe he's on to something here. He's on to something here. What do the millimeters mean? Who knows? I don't know what the millimeters mean. No one knows. He doesn't know. Focal length. What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is a focus? I did I did something worse in England cuz I did I tell you guys about the translator for the tip to tip trip. Yeah, twice. No. Did I? Oh, no. Once. Yeah, you did though. How I paid? You paid and then they translated it back and stuff like that. It was a good story though. I thought it was funny. Embarrassing. We're all freaking It's me and you are freaking stupid, man. Yeah, you both drink from the same bowl of water. It's the only way we can get it in our mouths. Well, does it so that he knows it's safe? Cuz Ying will get scared, dude. Are you training your new cat? One of those machines that Yingling can just paw at and it drops a treat down cuz he like does enrichment. It drops out a little like RX bar. We can't. We can't. He's regressing from a a dumb guy into just like a true beast animal. We have to feed. I tweeted out some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I just lied about what? My merch prices. Oh, you just lied. Yeah, I just lied. I don't think that was a lie. What did she say? I just tweeted out that you said a sweatshirt was $260. I was like, "Hey, I checked our pricing after the new tariffs and it sure cost $74 and sweatshirt costs $293." I just made up numbers. I was just I thought you asked him about it. No, I have no idea how much a blank costs before or after the tariffs, right? I was just on a run and I was like, I'm going to lie. I like that. And then I just tweeted out the lie. What's the t-shirt cost now? T-shirt? What was it before? What was it after? He doesn't know poster ter I don't know the t-shirts yet. Those could be cheaper. Do you know any item? Yeah, that jacket. That jacket is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. That jacket. I mean, he's not The problem is far off. Uh, is it equal to the percentage increase in tariff? Is it like 100 or more? I mean, not not quite because you're the tariff only applies to the cost of the good. But that jacket was probably going to sell for something like $110, $120 cuz it is a really nice down jacket. And now it might have to sell for something like 200. Oh my god, he is not going to sell it. That's tough. Uh wish I don't I literally I don't know what to do. I already dude you grew up with pull up my Twitter zipper. I already figured this all out. That tweet went crazy by the way. I know. I tweeted I told the people you just made up numbers to create political change. All you guys are wearing these stupid [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] watches and they're and the whole podcast. You're like it won't stop. But why do we just say 3:05 p.m. Because someone said serious and so they they thought it serious. What a piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] product. Just got back the estimate for our merch with the new tariffs. Not that bad. 74 for a shirt, 293 for a sweatshirt. You just made that up. I hope you continue. I wrote I'm going to community notes you. I wrote I hope you continue to give your money in these uncertain times. And you know what? 110,000 people liked it. So I think they're going to give us You also roasted Yingling to an 11K like tweet. Remember when you were like, "You guys got to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] chill out on him?" Someone said, "Have it made in America." And I said, "I'm trying. It takes a long time. I have to teach Yingling about supply and demand." And and then someone asked if there's free shipping and I said no. So I've already taken care of all the optics. Deal. This is bad. This is a this is a for me. What if we made you know that picture of Hassan and it says like it what does it say on the shirt? Make the rich pay. Says yeah. It says make the rich pay. What if we made like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tariffs and the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the f is like the anarchist like kind of it says [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tariffs. And we and we have our jack like our like our buttons jacket like this and it's like we pose like this. Yeah. And it's like the same posing and we sell them for $180. Yeah. Yeah. We sell we sell them for a dollar for every percent that tariffs are. So it can fluctuate in pricing. Well, also instead of saying [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tariffs, we say [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the Chinese. Whoa. Whoa. Cuz that's like how cuz that's they're the problem. It's not cuz they make all they make the shirts and they're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and they're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] us somehow. No, it's that we Donald Trump said they're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] us, so we have to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] them back. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the Chinese. What if it's Jesus, man? You know, that's what the shirt should say cuz I never get the point across. That's what the shirt could say. You make it in America. America. It's It's one of those like uh paintings that has scary face and happy face. And this and the happy face is it says, "Fuck Donald Trump." The scary face goes the the Chinese behind it. And it's both. And it's both. Donald Trump's lowkey Chinese. I don't think your phone cuz it it changes in his hand. Dude, what do you think's going on in the world right now? I'm just I just read the news. You need your watch to tell you what time it is. You know, you seen that clip. You seen that clip of Ronald Reagan getting circulated by the embassy of China where he's talking about how tariffs are really bad. Reagan was a Chinese plant, dude. Look in Hold up. Pause. China instated Reagan. He was a Chinese plant. Lemonade stand talking points. Yeah. To interpret. This was a lemonade stand talking point. Oh, they already said it. No, you don't get to do that. You don't get to do that because every story you tell on this podcast, you recycle on your goddamn chopped tug stream. That's But that's fine cuz it's a oneman show. He's bringing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] from the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Oh, I'm bringing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Crime or cringe? I'm I'm smoking on Chinese plant. That's what I was thinking about. Dude, I really want to smoke opium. Okay. God, you're such a weeb. That's cool. That is not Japanese. What do you smoke it at? It's like a bowl, right? It's like a crack pipe. How do you smoke opium? I think it's a pipe. Yeah, you can smoke. You smoke it like we should make so good. Shit's so good. You do it for 100 years. I want to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] smoke opium so bad. Will you do it with me? Thank you. Zipper will do it with you. Zipper will do. I won't join you on the I was saying it's crazy he don't go to Coachella with his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with Crimson Blur and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Lick Toad Venom and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ape ape wild about it. Dude, you should join Opium like with Playboy Cardi and you should start dressing in all black and play at Coachella. What is Opium gang? You know, none of you guys follow. Is this a artist? Sorry, guys. Hey, I'm off the train. Sorry, guys. I don't know anything. That one's on me. Hey, if Alex is listening, which he's not, he'll really like that. I'm just a stupid guy, man. It's fine, man. Who doesn't know? I think Coachella blows, dude. I'm not going to Coachella. Just he just makes that surprise. He just says, "I can't believe you're going to Coachella to not do toad Venom with the Crimson Blur." Why are you thinking about it? No. Were you offered? No. Is it cuz the blur's not going or the Toad's not there yet? Like what's the issue here? They ship a whole truck full of Toads for [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for just a lineup issue, you know? It's like if I'm going to do Toad Venom with Blur, it's like I could at least listen to some artists I'm really big fan of. It's a chopped lineup, not going to lie. Coachella. I Yeah, I looked at all the band like damn, there's like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so few that I care about here. I just don't know what I'd do with my body if I went to Coachella. I think I'm actually on your wave where I don't think I'm capable of locking into festival life for three days. Even when I go to EDC, I leave a day early cuz I'm like, I'm done. I just don't understand. All the influencers who go, I feel like they're fake and liking it or just doing drugs. No influencer likes music. Let's get that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Amen. Music. So, at least you're not going. You're not faking. I'm saying all these influencers go to Coachella. They're going cuz they want to hoe out and get pics hoed out. Say it louder now. Or they want to go do drug, you know. So they're going to freaking do drug and you can kind of do drug in Coachella. That's what people go to Coachella for. Yeah. You get the Toad Venom. You camp out. You You visit hell. Am I wrong? No, you're not. Is there a third reason I'm missing? You should go to like Burning Man. Some people do drugs there. We should. Yeah, dude. Something you could go to with to do Toad Venom with the Crimson Blur. You could go there. What year did all those people get trapped at Burning Man? Was that that happened, right? Two years ago. Two Burning Man. Is that a Firefest thing happening? Didn't that come back? It's coming back. That's crazy. No way. That's crazy. I guess it actually kind of make you buy out the IP for pennies on the dollars. You use all the high is so they sure. Yeah, they just drank the name. Oh, is Jaw Rule still going to be involved? I hope not. Fire festival, dude. Fire. Dude, festivals are weird. Go to how it works. Imagine how awesome it would be if they rug it though. Same thing. It's like, well, that's my bad for buying it again. Wait, is there a lineup? Can you scroll up? I saw it said Phoenix. Was that Arizona or the band? I feel like this is such a good idea cuz it everybody knows about it now. I I think it seems like lineup has not been announced. Wait, why are these bad? Just cuz it's known about. I mean, it's going to pop off, right? Yeah. No, but you just the 25K. 25K. Dude, these are expensive. That's the black medallion. I guess it's artist access and their website runs like butt. Can you hover over fuego? Dude, this is crazy how bad it runs. But this is taking all up the RAM, which is a source of memory that is used when the Yeah. Okay. Uh and there's no partnership happening. This is a a festival for pedophiles to go meet each other. Just so you guys understand that. Don't get it twisted. Oh, you said something in the primo and it got bleeped. Me? Yeah. I was me and Cutie were trying to guess what you said. You were talking about someone and then it was like and then it bleeped and I thought you said they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kids. Oh no, we would never bleep. I don't remember the context. I say all sorts of awesome stuff that gets censored by the media. What was the conversation? You have to give more context to the conversation. It was in the primo. You were talking about somebody. We should have a Crimo. That's what uh I saw at the Coachella. There's an international delight booth and it says # creamernation all over. And I'm like, that's good branding. That's pretty funny. I don't remember. It's all right. I don't remember. I don't have awesome. Have you guys Have you gone to music festivals? Have you gone to music festivals? I've never been. I don't think I ever will till I die. No, they're literally lame. I I was thinking about I was like, it's so much better just to go see the band you like. Like I I don't know. I don't But I don't do drugs or drink anymore. It's like if I did that, it' probably be really fun. I would love to dress up Aiden for a music festival. Oh, yeah. Oh, I want to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] make you look like Lady Gaga. If you The next one you go to, can we dress you? Yeah. Oh, that's going to be fun. I would I would dress you like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Waluigi. Can you look up [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Waluigi? That's definitely going to pop up. That's definitely going to populate. Like tasteful though. So like tasteful. It's not news. Yeah. Lude Waluigi. No, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Waluigi. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Waluigi. Sorry, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] images now. Um, yeah, that second one is what the second one is what the third one's Oh, it's so small. But you I you would need to have the nose. Wait, I could get like that. You could get like that. You get like that. Yeah, you got CGs. That wouldn't take that long. I mean, you're the closest one to CG's there, dude. Oh, you got CGs. Oh, dude, you're money. You're looking like Walton Gogggins in that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You're money, dude. Mia, we're dressed up like Waluigi. What if we had a CG off? We We would lose. What do you mean? No, we all did. Like, we all had a CG. What is CG? I didn't put it together. I know. I know that. I just didn't put it together. Yeah, I think you guys don't know what the CGs are. I don't know what a CG off is. I got CGs. We all develop CGs and then we put like tapioca pudding or something in there and it runs like a race and see who's whose looks like the looks like. Is it whose flows the fastest or the slowest wins? It's it would be the fastest because the more developed the CG Look at you. I put a little [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I put a little model ship in that. Fill it with cream and then put a model ship in there. Yeah. And how fast the tapioca pudding goes through the CG is it's basically a race. It's very easy. I'm about to get very toned. You cuz Well, you're still going to eat my marathon candy and pastries. I don't eat candy, but I don't eat pastries in the office. Well, I had one. Aiden's the one who eats candy. And you're eating the Yeah, he's eat candy. And also, you're eating Mr. Beast eggs. No, I had half of one. See, that's what I'm saying. There's no soft spot. What if you had to carry Mr. be Sig and I had to you had to give birth to the hair of the of the next empire and and so I'm sitting on the egg and everyone knows I have the egg. You're kind of It's kind of a March of the Penguin situation. Yeah. Egg is implanted in you. I would probably have to migrate because I think people would come for me to like steal the baby. To steal the egg. Yeah. Of Mr. Beast's egg. Can you imagine? Wait, is there is like a golden goose? Is the egg fertile? Yeah, of course the egg's fertile. put it in me. Mr. Beast Mr. Beast creates a new technology so that he can make not only the spermis but also the egg and he puts them together to make a baby of only his own genus. But he needs somebody to carry the egg. Just be a clone. No, it would be an awesome. It would be a clone. That is what a clone. It would be a clone. And that's the best thing, Nick, because surely all your sperms are different. Isn't that how they made the clone of the Who's What's All your sperms are different. Dolly the sheep. If I come and I egg, that's me. It's me and me. That's me. Surely there's differences. I I mean, yeah, like nature verse nurture, but it's just me. No, I I don't know enough about how you know when they say I won the race, like in the sperm, like I'm the sperm that won the race. You think it was a thousand little nicks that are like slightly different? They all got variables. I do think that's right. So, it wouldn't just be a clone, there'd be variables, right? I don't know how faces grow. I I I think I think this is interest more interesting to actually learn about than it is to I think it's actually No, I think it's more interesting to just have our own theories. Well, okay, you have but you have identical twins in the womb. Okay, that's weird. Why is it weird? Cuz why aren't they different? Because they started started as one and then they split which is different than fraternal twins. So I guess they fraternal twins are different. So that that proves your theory right that some sperms are different. Some sperms have like But isn't fraternal twins means there's two eggs and they both get it means it means two sperms got fertilized in in two eggs. I don't dude just Eiffel Towering one of the eggs. What? Like two [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] two sperms just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] let's go. Right. I think it's two eggs. They're dapping each other up. I think one egg that's split is identical and then two eggs is fraternal and then the two eggs get ovulated. This is just such a Aha. Right. That makes sense. Did you know the egg cell is the size of a period in a textbook? And I read that once and it was such a good image. You know, the incel is the size of three x-rayers lined up side by side. Like 1.7 or something like that. That's pretty heavy. I'm so glad. So, it wouldn't be a clone. It wouldn't be a clone. It wouldn't be a clone. It would be maybe a worse or better version. I think it's in Mr. interest to clone himself. Um, and then do it a thousand times and then give them all lightsabers. Dude, if he could clone himself, he could make the videos all him. Dude, he could start he could start being like, "What is it like if I blow apart a guy with dynamite and him do it, dude?" The video he just did where he's like feeding meals to a school in Kenya, but then instead of a stream of children, it's a stream of young Mr. Beast coming out of the school. No, no. It's it's it's like a 100 Mr. Beasts feeding the kids. He just creates a clone army. You guys are just It's like Star Wars. There's kind of the Star Wars but also the Prestige. It's like the Prestige. Yes, I was thinking that, too. And he does it's essentially magic tricks. Yes. Spoilers for the Prestige. It came out a while ago as well. Also, Joe Peshi is in that. And And he makes all these clones. He blows them up with dynamite. No one's upset at it because one, they kind of hate Mr. Beast. Two, they're clones. So, the ethical conversation is a little different. It's like, do you have the right to blow up your clone if you make it? Is it? Is it? Is it slime? If we made a clone of Aiden at every episode of the yard we came, we shot him in the head. I think at the end and then we just bring him back. Oh my god. That would be Christmas. That would be Christmas. Make two Aiden's and one does lemonade stand, one does ours. Yeah. We all mix up the You know, it would be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up if one day we mix up cuz we dress them the same. We mix up dress in this scenario. You're dressing me in the morning. It's not something you need to do for normal me. Prime and one of the clones, but we don't know. That'd be messed up. So now it's like an Aiden Prime is like exactly the same. If you accidentally kill the original, this is Mickey. This is the movie that just came out. This is Mickey 17. It's also an invisible. It's a classic trope. But we're going to shoot you in the head. You're not understanding how I understand. Either you or someone. I don't care how old your friend Mickey is. We're going to do this anyways. But I I think I'd feel bad if we killed normal Aiden. Yeah. And then we had the clone Aiden. Like it's He's exactly the same. kind of cheap. I don't even believe that you'd feel bad if you killed normal Aiden. I want to keep one in like a jar that we can go like this and he'll go put it back on like Black Mirror. Like Don Draper is in the little machine. It's like Black Mirror. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I want to keep a clone of you and put it in a computer for a thousand years. Mhm. And accelerate the time and then watch you go insane. That's awful. I want to put one in the microwave like a beep. I want I I do want to run a Sims server and it's just a thousand views. They have so many issues with each other. Fast forward and then I come back in two two years. Then beef. Then beef for sure. Two Aidens. Do you think they just end up loving each other? No. I think two Aidens get along fine. But when you increase when we're talking like hundred Aidens in a society together, it starts to crumble. Do you think so? Absolutely. Oh, definitely. Where do you think it breaks down? I think you would have a higher number. I think two Lwigs it breaks down. I think a 100 slimes is great. I love to lead and also follow. What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you laughing at? My worst [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nightmare. You just describe I just had a shiver. It was like worst nightmare of the hunters. The Squidward town, but it's just slime. You see like a blur of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] outbursts everywhere. There would be no silence. Dubbin. Dubbin. Oh, we would miss Dubbin so bad. Dude, we would we would all sneak over to Dubbin Town to hang out with a 100 Dubbins. But 100 Dubbins do not want to hang out. Trojan horse yourself in the slime town. There'd be like a Dubin like room you go and there' just be like villagers in Minecraft. You just have to go up to the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Dubins and we're all trapped. All are trapped. Oh god, that'd be so funny, bro. But I I think my society would actually be the most successful because I love leading and also following and I would have no ego or qualms about it. Neither would my Nick Nickville would be working on the nuclear arm that we're going to drop on Slimeville. We would all everyone in society gets free food, gets free healthcare, but you have to work on the bomb. Oh, I would I would [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] destroy your project in Nick's world is so much different and it's so much more important. Nick's world would be so crazy. It would just have the most advanced Call of Duty mod, no resources, no plumbing against each other burger for dinner. But the parking but the parking's free. They'll be sweating versus each other, bro. Break down instantly. And I would, by the way, they try to work on this bomb. I would kill the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] every single [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I would kill before that bomb because they would have this slime one punch dojo where they learn how to sleep in one punch. And then that's they leave. That's the whole training session. They each have their own punching bag with a picture of Shake on it. Yeah. And Shake Town is like it's just enslaved. Yes. Well, we're going to enslave you in the Patreon if you go there now cuz that's where the next episode is with comedy. With cuz enslaving you to laugh comedy. That's free. So, go to the Patreon for the premium episode and we'll see you there. Where the hell's that? Where the hell's that? Oh my god. Because you know he means it. He says that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like like he should be saying it. He rolls off the tongue. So, I I really think it's Look at the little dog down there trying to get some of that water. He trying to get a little desperate. Oh my god, he's scared. This is why Josh had me do this. That guy does not look that old. The dad. Wait, now I kind of want to see the rest of the countdown. That's You want to take a look? Take a look. Look.
