 You will see a very fancy looking turtle woman. &gt;&gt; Is she attractive? &gt;&gt; Well, it's his mother. So, yes. Tell us what your mother's name is. &gt;&gt; Her name's Paloma. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Dude, you look bad. &gt;&gt; It turns bright purple. Oh, yeah. That's bad. He's got the plague. The apothecary did say there'd be risks to the plan. How far can you lead us? I &gt;&gt; can't launch the ship, you bastard. Hello and welcome to the yard episode nine. Nine. It's not I'm going to keep saying it and it's going to be true like yeah one of these. It's it's it's nine enough. It's nine enough. Uh you all are out aboard Rook Tide Walker ship. Me baby. And the last thing that we saw was Leonus kind of stormed off in a huff. Selenia looked at you, Gorg, and said, "I need your help." And kind of like physically sort of starts pushing you away further across the deck, leaving Ron, Kaladus, and Stone Beard alone with Rook Tide Walker. &gt;&gt; Also, I'm sick if anyone cares. If anyone cares, I'm still have the plague. &gt;&gt; Also sick. &gt;&gt; Well, you were already dead to begin with. There's a lot of complaining about death from a man who's faced it. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he's uh he's scared of what he is. &gt;&gt; We don't know. &gt;&gt; I'm coughing for the first time. I don't know where I would see. &gt;&gt; How do I do it? &gt;&gt; Cover covered a little bit, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Like any amount. &gt;&gt; Like cigarettes all the time. Never coughed. Isn't that strange? &gt;&gt; There's I can see a bit of his lung through his chest there. It's &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so sorry. That's embarrassing. &gt;&gt; Pepperoni. Pepperoni lung. I don't have pepperoni lung. It's totally &gt;&gt; on in the pool. &gt;&gt; Normal size. &gt;&gt; It's going around. I suppose it's um you know, we didn't have a lot of time to talk here before all of this started happening. I actually knew those lads when they were oh knee high to a grasshopper. Always an emotional boy. Always. &gt;&gt; He was emotional &gt;&gt; and sort of a um well, be polite. He was never the sharpest sword in the sheath. You see that? The other one. His mother though, that's a that's a different thing. &gt;&gt; Seems like she has it all. &gt;&gt; I see. You should see her in battle. Honestly, you know, she she can swing a sword. She can &gt;&gt; I want to see her in a sundress. &gt;&gt; Oh, wait. No, don't touch me. You're you're you're deathly. We We've We've You're deathly ill. Listen, I just had a question for the two of you, though. Um, we don't know what we're sailing into here. I suppose no one ever does. &gt;&gt; But are they going to be able to lock it up in time? &gt;&gt; Probably not. Probably not. &gt;&gt; They should be fine. &gt;&gt; Probably better if it's just me and you from here on. &gt;&gt; To be honest, if I were to rank the reliability in battle, it would be Gorg is the best. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Sorry. What? Of course. Yeah, I'm number one. &gt;&gt; Well, I write down after every battle their performances. I have a performance review so you can see York usually talk. &gt;&gt; Those are details notes you. That is quite a likeness of Paloma. Flip back to that one. &gt;&gt; Okay. I get it. I get it. I &gt;&gt; I just eyealled it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You want to make sure you remember that those that guy's throat for you though one time. Yeah. But you can see who's last consistently. &gt;&gt; Very consistently. Right. Consistent. &gt;&gt; Yo, I haven't been trying. I'm also sick as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] So, I'm sick as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Also, I I must say just for our friends at home, he literally has notes about who's the best out of the He wasn't making that up, by the way. &gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz he's an evil tormentor. He's evil. He knows how our brains work. &gt;&gt; The truth is the truth. It is. &gt;&gt; Truth is the truth. &gt;&gt; Now, listen. I I I got to let you know something here. Part of the reason why we're so successful here at Leo is we do things a little bit different. And I know how to lean on my crew and I know how to lean on my better half. And we work together and that's how we win. We're more of a horizontal leadership structure. &gt;&gt; Yeah, those never go wrong. &gt;&gt; Well, I mean, &gt;&gt; wow. &gt;&gt; This episode was recorded on December 16th, 2024. [Laughter] The books were cooked they were. &gt;&gt; Dude, that is dude that's off brand for you. Can you [Laughter] &gt;&gt; It's I only bring their top because if things are about to go as sideways as I think we'll need to be able to rely on each other. That's all. &gt;&gt; Well, you can rely on us. We are at the end of the day the Terodin. &gt;&gt; Indeed. Indeed. And I've got not but respect for you. It's just I've not risen to my position and not just captain of this ship, but one of the ones who keeps an eye on and looks after all of Leo. I haven't done that by getting stuck in my head. You know, sometimes you got to admit when you don't know what you don't know. That's a good point. You should admit things you don't know. &gt;&gt; Agreed. Agreed. Captain, can I can I speak to you over here? &gt;&gt; Uh, can you stay at least 6 ft away during that? All right. said, "Do you have another one of those knitted masks that the other lad was wearing?" &gt;&gt; No, those look extremely lame. &gt;&gt; He just takes the bandana off of his pirate and his like red hair kind of goes wild. He's ties it on. He's like, I figure it's might be good for something. Be back with you in just a moment. &gt;&gt; I'll just stay here, I guess. &gt;&gt; You might inspect the cannons. &gt;&gt; I I'll make sure they're clean. &gt;&gt; Yes. And he does sort of like over to the side with you and he's like, I ran Galadus. I'm ser I'm just I wanted to ask you know do do you Leonus I just I think he's too into the girl. I think he's too into the girl. I feel like none of us are saying it &gt;&gt; and I'm worried that it's going to it's going to impair his ability to be part of the Pterodin. What do you think? &gt;&gt; Your soldier is not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] priests. I mean it's as long as as long as he can shoot the arrow in the right direction. I I I think it's good to have something to fight for besides your &gt;&gt; I'm just I guess I'm a little pissed cuz I I'm I'm pretty certain he got me sick and &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; and I just don't want that to happen to you &gt;&gt; or anyone else. &gt;&gt; What exactly are you proposing we do with the young miss? Cast her overboard. &gt;&gt; I want to try I want to throw him overboard. Meanwhile, as he's trying to convince him to throw Selenia overboard, she has sort of pushed Yugorg almost like literally kind of like back towards a corner like looking around and she's like, "Okay, &gt;&gt; what's up?" &gt;&gt; This is sort of the first time you've kind of gotten closer to her, especially post transformation where her blonde hair is now streing. She's got these very small things that really you can kind of only make out when she like smiles or she's upset about something. &gt;&gt; How does she smell? &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; That's odd. &gt;&gt; And she does just sort of like push you against the wall. And you see she sort of like takes her hair and like kind of like shakes it out a little bit. And she says, "Dork, I need you to help me." &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah, sure. What? What you did? Is it like a It's like It's like a phase like it's like you feel like like the the the hair dye and stuff like that. &gt;&gt; It Oh, the No, this I mean you were there. I was possessed by a vampire. &gt;&gt; Yeah, but you could just like you could like, you know, go back, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah, but why would I want that? Like looked at me like I'm saying, right? So, you're kind of like you now. &gt;&gt; I think that's cool, &gt;&gt; you know? Um, I am finally me and that is cool. &gt;&gt; I think that's cool. &gt;&gt; You know, listen. Um, so I don't have a lot of experience with these sort of things. I I I was kind of sheltered and you've sort of had the most experience with &gt;&gt; I've had a lot of experience &gt;&gt; with with Right. And um &gt;&gt; like everything. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and and and and you're so brave and I just was like um so Leonus is um &gt;&gt; I just don't know how to tell him. &gt;&gt; Yeah, what's going on with that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] This is so weird. You guys are weird. &gt;&gt; You're weird. &gt;&gt; Sorry. &gt;&gt; Excuse I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Aren't you the guy that had tortifilus and neglected his daughter and didn't tell his mother that she was a grandmother? So, I'm just saying if we're going to be like chasing judgement, &gt;&gt; judge Judith, &gt;&gt; can we just talk? Can we just talk? &gt;&gt; Yes, we can talk. Sorry. I get I I I get I don't know. &gt;&gt; Hurt people hurt people. I get it. Like you feel you right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Here's the thing. What do you see? He's so weak. &gt;&gt; He's not weak. I can hit twice in combat. Sometimes he can. &gt;&gt; She very much just sort of gives you the punch. And she's no physically stronger than anyone. So I mean just she ow ow. What are you made out of? &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's like dense. Very dense. &gt;&gt; You are very dense. &gt;&gt; Cadillac. &gt;&gt; It's um I just I I want him to know how much I care about him. &gt;&gt; So just tell him. &gt;&gt; Why? I can't just like say it because what if he's like &gt;&gt; dude then here's the thing. Tom Kench back in school &gt;&gt; that that guy that like that dude was a &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. He was fat and &gt;&gt; he got fat later. Sorry. &gt;&gt; And he he took there was this this other uh toral and her name was Gwen and he took her to prom. And you know what? He just went up and asked her &gt;&gt; and she was the hottest thing in the damn whole private school. And Tom Kench, bless his damn heart, he went up and said, "Gwen, will we go to prom with me?" &gt;&gt; So you you you did go to private school, huh? That cuz I thought you were from the mud in the in the street corn and I'm sorry. Say we're not doing that. We're not doing that. Sorry. We're not doing that. We're not You know what? That's me. &gt;&gt; She's throwing barbs at me. You're throwing catching straight. I'm sorry. You're helping me. &gt;&gt; It's my fault I did it first. But what I'm saying is you just shoot your shot. And if Gwen said, "No, Tom Kent, you're fat. I don't want to date. I don't want to go to prom with you." &gt;&gt; Been kind of judgment. &gt;&gt; We would have smoked [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] weed back in the in in the corners. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; we would have just went and hung out. &gt;&gt; Oh, so if I if I shoot my shot and he turns me down, we'll just get blazed. &gt;&gt; You just can't have Tell me what we'll get blazed. If he doesn't If he doesn't respond to you and he's like, "I'm sorry, I'm not interested." I will smoke you the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out. I know Ron's got pack. &gt;&gt; She's like, he did he did he did cop that seaweed back like &gt;&gt; and it'll be fine, but you got to sack up. That's all I'm saying. &gt;&gt; Sack up. Okay, sack up. &gt;&gt; And he's never had sex, so he's going to like probably say yes. &gt;&gt; I don't know that for sure, but I'm pretty sure. &gt;&gt; Okay, but I don't &gt;&gt; You know what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Neither have I. &gt;&gt; That's fine. It doesn't matter as much. &gt;&gt; Neither of us know what to do. Yeah, but he's going to like if there's a passport in the room, he'll [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; I thought you guys were like sailors. Haven't you at least like like seen diagrams or like been to like &gt;&gt; I mean we've watched some scrolls. &gt;&gt; But &gt;&gt; I'm just saying he's way look he's way more nervous than you're nervous. I promise you. I've hung out with him. I know his dad. &gt;&gt; Dad's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] too. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. And meanwhile, Leonus, Leonus, you have sort of like stalked down the stairs dramatically into the the lower hold, right? And um me baby is a it's it's a warship. Uh so it is a not insignificant crew. &gt;&gt; Meab is a warship. &gt;&gt; Baby's built like a warship. &gt;&gt; It's got those weird horns. They can just kind of like crank it and it just goes intermittently. Um, and although the seas are a little choppy, again, you as a sea elf are completely used to this. And although there's a pretty consistent coming and going of crew on here, it's fairly easy to kind of like find a a dark place to yourself. And as you sort of come down there alone, what are you thinking, Leonus? Uh, I I'm thinking about being I'm upset and I'm frustrated because uh I brushed I think I I really upset Selenia right before this and uh I'm struggling to figure out how to tell her how I how I feel. And at the same time at the same time I'm a bit I'm my my lymph nodes are swollen, my neck hurts. Uh, I feel better than I did before, but I'm I'm very sick and I feel it's hard to think or like hold any consistent thought. I just keep beating through the emotions of like anxious, feel bad, selenia, how can I fix this? I'm going to die in seven days and I'm thinking about my mom and my dad. &gt;&gt; I mean, who isn't really? Yeah. And uh I think I and I feel very alone. I wanted to be alone. That's why I left the deck, but I want to be back up there with my friends now, but it feels weird to just walk up there after stomping off. And uh I feel like I feel like I'm about to die. And I And I feel like my friends don't respect me. &gt;&gt; And you're virgin. &gt;&gt; And you're uninvited virgin. &gt;&gt; Going to die a unrespected virgin. &gt;&gt; I explored I explored multiple planes. I'm knowledgeable. I have had sex. I'm not thinking about that right now cuz I'm not insecure about it. So, I don't need to think about that. &gt;&gt; It's with his girlfriend from the plane of &gt;&gt; Canada. A different dimension. &gt;&gt; That's why you haven't met her. But um uh but as you're sort of down there, give me a perception check. one sec plus six 25 &gt;&gt; as you're sort of like again taking in both the sights and smells of of a ship and it's kind of a a tough dichotomy for you because on the one hand the sea air of Leo &gt;&gt; I like that &gt;&gt; is incredibly pleasant and then there's less a less pleasant bouquet sort of mixed in with that but you hear distinctly Leonus Leonus my Leonus it is your father's 's voice. &gt;&gt; Dad, &gt;&gt; what is your father's name? Leonus. &gt;&gt; Uh, Jordan, it's just &gt;&gt; Hang on a second. Everybody, everybody roll the d cuz I would love to. Everybody roll the d4. I was about to say Paloma in the nature of Paloma ended up uh being dictated by others. &gt;&gt; It's a trial. &gt;&gt; I want him to have a normal name so bad. &gt;&gt; Three. &gt;&gt; The D4 is the crulest die. And that's a one. &gt;&gt; That is a three. &gt;&gt; Wait, two. &gt;&gt; I You just changed &gt;&gt; three and a two. Wait, did did Leonus get did Leonus get a four? &gt;&gt; You got a three. &gt;&gt; I rolled a three. &gt;&gt; Well, we So, hang on. Gork had a three also. Roll off then. Roll off. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's a roll off. &gt;&gt; Roll off. &gt;&gt; Got to roll each other off. &gt;&gt; Three. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; three. &gt;&gt; He wins. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; My I will name him properly. I would name him Cold [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; He'll be &gt;&gt; That's his street name. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, &gt;&gt; and his real name. Actually, I tell you what, in in in the spirit of democracy, you can give us his nickname. His name is Jordan Azul. That is his name. &gt;&gt; Jordan Azoul. &gt;&gt; But but you can get what what what what do they what do they call him out here folks call him? &gt;&gt; They call him Cold [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; I'd like to solve Dave. I know. &gt;&gt; Jordan Cole Cockazul. Yes. &gt;&gt; Like C O C H. &gt;&gt; Uh, perfect. Perfect. But you you are certain it is your father's voice. It sounds distant, but it is him. &gt;&gt; When I hear this, am I confident it's coming from within the room or is it in my head? Do I not &gt;&gt; It is physically in the space. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm looking around. I Dad. Dad. And I'm I'm looking at the line of crew and people looking for a sign of like my dad's hair, his like blue skin. As you look around, you realize you've kind of wandered into sort of like an an empty space kind of near the front of the ship, near the cargo hole, cuz again, you wanted to be alone. And as your eyes sort of start to kind of take it in, you realize there is another person sitting there. It is sort of an androgynous person with deep crimson skin and curling ivory horns that are etched without chemical runes. They have golden cat-like eyes. They're wearing a patchwork of velvet and worn leather which is covered in bandeliers like ammo straps, but instead of bullets, there's like vials and files of things um stacked into it. And as you sort of notice this person here, you realize they smell faintly of brimstone and exotic herbs. And a smile kind of comes across their face. And you can see their teeth have what look like um Peter caps on their fangs. Their fangs are a little longer than Selenia's. &gt;&gt; Hey, did you did you hear someone My name's Leonus. Did you hear someone yell Leonus just now? &gt;&gt; I did. Yes, it was your father. &gt;&gt; How do you know that's my father? &gt;&gt; Uh because and this person stands up and they say, "I thought Gorg was the brains of the operation." And they kind of put their hands behind their back and they walk over about six feet away from you and they were like, "I was hoping we'd get to speak like this." Leonus, &gt;&gt; you thought Gueorg was the brains of the operations. It cut to me. I'm just on the deck of the ship trying to bite fish. &gt;&gt; Um, I was being facitious, Leonus. Sorry, let me use a smaller word. &gt;&gt; I know. &gt;&gt; I was being sarcastic. I know what facious means. I know what that mean. Why? Why do you know what? You were hoping we meet. You know what my father sounds like? Did you make that noise? &gt;&gt; No, your father made that noise. &gt;&gt; He's here. &gt;&gt; Oh, he's not with you. He's with me. That's what I wanted to talk to you about. &gt;&gt; I I think you need to you need to explain better. &gt;&gt; He turns and looks around. He's like, "This is an astonishing vessel." Um, listen, I have no idea how much time we've got until somebody comes storming in here with something stupid. Um, either Ran comes down here high, lamenting his imminent death again, which is strange. Gorg comes down here ranting about the latest pirate winch he intends to bed because there is a wide selection aboard this ship. Or perhaps Stone Beard will start ranting about the war and wanting to settle down with Paloma and give Gorg a little brother or sister. &gt;&gt; How? You're freaking me out. How do you know all my friends? How do you know my dad? How do you know all these people's names? How do you know that he Stone Beard talks about the Well, most people know that he talks about the world all the time. It's really It doesn't work by a month. It's really dead. Most people &gt;&gt; not that impressive that I know these travel to a strapping pirate gal &gt;&gt; like this. &gt;&gt; 17 years I'm there, right? &gt;&gt; I'm killing people. &gt;&gt; I'm full rage. &gt;&gt; Am I # act natural? &gt;&gt; I I reach over and I I tap I tap the vial on his on his coat. You reach out, he takes a step backwards. Or they take a step backwards, sorry. And they're like, &gt;&gt; "No touching." &gt;&gt; What's in that? &gt;&gt; Which one? This one. &gt;&gt; That one. &gt;&gt; Um, this is a flesh eating um necrotoxin. &gt;&gt; Oh, and you're carrying that out in the open on the on the boat. &gt;&gt; Sure, because I need it to be like type. Yes. Right. He He doesn't actually do it. He's like It's just that's what I need it for. No, listen. I'm not here to engage in fisticuffs. I just want to make a little deal. &gt;&gt; You're You're beating around the bush a lot. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to be direct currently. &gt;&gt; You're not being direct at all. Say what you mean. &gt;&gt; Convince them to turn back and I will let your father live. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Johnson was sweet. Where's Where are you keep I don't understand. Where are you keeping my father? &gt;&gt; You hero types are all the same. Am I supposed to engage in some villainous monologue and then you will just come charging bravely and foolishly in. &gt;&gt; Okay, let me take one step back. Listen, let me break it down for you because apparently you're missing subtext, which is why you and Selenia have not made any more progress. Subtext, boy. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; Listen, listen. Look at me. Look at me. Look at my eyes. My eyes are hypnotic. I look at my eyes. I'm the apothecary. &gt;&gt; You're who we're looking for. &gt;&gt; I am. What a surprise. Who' have thought? &gt;&gt; It is me. Yes, I'm behind all of it. Yes, &gt;&gt; I below. Can Have I Can I just &gt;&gt; All of you give me perception checks. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Okay. Uh 15. &gt;&gt; 15. Well, is that total? &gt;&gt; 15 total. &gt;&gt; Okay. 15 10 &gt;&gt; 20 wound. &gt;&gt; The two of you are sort of doing your thing, especially cuz Selenius is over there like, "Wait, no. Okay, hang on. Wait. This many buttons down the shirt? This seems excessive to &gt;&gt; Oh, no. No. I promise. I promise. It's exactly what you'd like. &gt;&gt; You can almost see my navl. Why would I &gt;&gt; That's kind of like the point. I know. Look, but it's supposed to like me for like me. &gt;&gt; I They do. But it's also like a thing. It's also whatever you're comfortable with. You definitely shouldn't do whatever you're not comfortable with. &gt;&gt; I mean, yeah. Well, you know, no. I mean, okay. Consent. Yes. You told me consent is sexy. You said that. &gt;&gt; I said that. &gt;&gt; You did say that. That is true. I just I mean, if I just &gt;&gt; But you got a hot nabl. That's all I'm saying. &gt;&gt; I mean, if if you And she does sort of like hike the shirt a little. She like start tying it in a knot, too. She's like I mean, if you think this is what is going to like help him understand, &gt;&gt; I think it'll help. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm a little further away. I'm gearing up for like a football tackle, but I still want to throw her off the boat. So I I I am about to go for it. &gt;&gt; Uh with the 21 though is you do have sort of like a minor court of of pirates cuz again Leico is a very egalitarian place. There's all kinds of sentensients on this boat. Uh but you have sort of gained the attention of of some of the younger more attractive crew members regailing them. And you do hear off in the distance you swear you hear Leonis. Guys, guys, guys, yes. It's been IY, but I I think I should fetch you some drinks. Uh, stay right here. I'm going to go down to the cellar and uh get some mail. &gt;&gt; They were like, "Oh my god, he's so hot." As uh uh you do sort of start making your way down. And &gt;&gt; as I walk away, is my axe tingling? &gt;&gt; No, not currently. Important point of clarification. Where's Coots during the RZ section? &gt;&gt; During the RI Coots is kind of like the Kobe to my shack when I'm rising. &gt;&gt; Very integral part. &gt;&gt; It is. &gt;&gt; Flicking up a cigar in your mouth. &gt;&gt; Lighting that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Perfect. &gt;&gt; Dave, is is Stone Beard's gut suntan? &gt;&gt; Probably. I mean, &gt;&gt; yeah. No, very &gt;&gt; I look like one of them 55year-olds who's tanned all over. It's like turkey. &gt;&gt; When are they not in the sun? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yep. Uh &gt;&gt; but it's hard like Joe Rogan, &gt;&gt; right? It's &gt;&gt; burn. &gt;&gt; Uh are you running quickly or you just kind of making your way down? &gt;&gt; Sauntering. I'm s I understand. I don't want anyone else to be alerted. So I'm sauntering down &gt;&gt; and and and maybe a little bit quicker cuz um as I'm getting closer, I'm hearing more noise. &gt;&gt; The axe is not is not rattling. But as you're coming uh and standing there in front of you, the apothecary turns and looks and he goes, "That's disappointing." Okay. So, am I to understand that you are not taking up my offer to retreat in exchange for your father's life? &gt;&gt; I I I'll retreat. I'll retreat. &gt;&gt; Where? I'll I'll I would I want to save my father. I want to save my father. Do I need to stop him from coming down? &gt;&gt; He He said very kind things about you. In fact, he said you would not uh be willing to sacrifice this mission for his sake. He was like, "My son understands the greater good and blah blah blah." And then I sort of gagged him cuz he was monologuing. It got boring. Um listen, &gt;&gt; you should do that when we were a kid. &gt;&gt; Let me just say real quick because I'm I'm pretty sure the big one's on his way and then things are going to take coming down the hall. &gt;&gt; You're not going to stop this plague because you're asking how I know all these things about you. I understand the nature of censions and how they think. I have attacked Leo's weakest point. They will never suspect how I am infecting all of them. Their doom is assured. &gt;&gt; Wait, can you save me? &gt;&gt; Can you save Ron? &gt;&gt; Of course. Is that what you'd like? The antidote? &gt;&gt; You should speak quickly. [Music] You you see he's like one second and they turn and they go Leonus &gt;&gt; and then look back at you and goes that'll buy us a few moments. But you do hear that. &gt;&gt; I got to see this. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I pull out my bow &gt;&gt; crackling thunder. Mhm. &gt;&gt; I'm kind of I'm a little wobbly cuz I I my my neck still hurts and I I'm coughing a little bit. &gt;&gt; You're going to give me the antidote. &gt;&gt; You're going to give me my dad and and and Stone Beard, come in here, Stone Beard, I need you. &gt;&gt; Still quite a few steps away. &gt;&gt; You can get there closer if if you'd like. uh Stone Beard as you open the door and you see the scene as described again with this crimson teling with the ivory horns that the standing there and Leonus has the bow drawn. &gt;&gt; Stone Beard, it's the apothecary. It's the apothecary. &gt;&gt; You're having sex with the apothecary. &gt;&gt; It's sex with the apothecary. &gt;&gt; Then why is the apothecary calling it incredible? &gt;&gt; I've never had anything like it. &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; This guy, it's &gt;&gt; We all thought he was a virgin. &gt;&gt; Not anymore. Wow. &gt;&gt; I wasn't a virgin before. &gt;&gt; Is this how you got it? &gt;&gt; Do you pass it via SC? &gt;&gt; Take your axe out. &gt;&gt; It's not tingling. &gt;&gt; Still not ringing. &gt;&gt; I have an axe that tingles when there's danger. This is not a dangerous person. I give the &gt;&gt; shove. &gt;&gt; When you go to do a shove, your hand goes right through them &gt;&gt; and they're like, &gt;&gt; "H, &gt;&gt; oh no. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't I don't even know if they're here. I can I can I just rip an arrow &gt;&gt; straight through them? Funk into the back of the wall. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Did the hand not show that enough? &gt;&gt; Well, I thought it might be a physical objects versus projectiles thing. Or &gt;&gt; why would a projectile be different? &gt;&gt; That doesn't really &gt;&gt; It makes sense. Let me handle this. That doesn't make sense though. &gt;&gt; But just just &gt;&gt; What do you think, George? The brains of this operation that that's I said that same thing just really really quick because I believe everything is about to go up a notch here in a moment. big fan of your work engineering with coups and like they start saying things that only another artificer would know &gt;&gt; like very much it's like the magical density and the cog relay and like like brilliant engineer. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's I made that 70 years ago too. &gt;&gt; It's 70 years ago. &gt;&gt; 70 years ago what I could make today. &gt;&gt; It's I was going to say if you haven't improved your skills in 70 years I don't know that I would freely confide that in people. &gt;&gt; Well don't don't do all that. Meanwhile, up on the deck, you two give me perception checks. &gt;&gt; I have sunglasses on like one of the Koopa lings. &gt;&gt; What Kooping has sunglasses? &gt;&gt; 10. I think it's Roy. &gt;&gt; 13. &gt;&gt; I was like, don't you mean Squirtle Squad? &gt;&gt; No, one of them does. &gt;&gt; No. Coupling has sunglasses. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of Kooplings. &gt;&gt; I know.

You do see Selenia has a couple of buttons down on her sort of tie off and like her hair is down. &gt;&gt; I'm just, you know, I'm Lisa and &gt;&gt; you see she very much is like flip flip. It's like she's trying. &gt;&gt; She looks like the royal Lisa an wicked flip flip. She obviously &gt;&gt; low key like I don't know. I'm trying to help her out with you know the fam. Just trying to be &gt;&gt; Oh, wait. Dude, I did hear that. &gt;&gt; She's like, "No, but Ran, really? I just want to make sure that Leonus knows I. And then you hear help, help. &gt;&gt; I do hear that. &gt;&gt; Definitely something. Someone's saying help. &gt;&gt; Go look. &gt;&gt; I pull out my swords.

Selenia, do you have your weapons? Also, button up one. &gt;&gt; Not the time. &gt;&gt; Wait, is this for when I'm fighting when when Okay, &gt;&gt; princess. Stay here or off the boat. Or maybe jump off the boat. We're going to go explore, but maybe just stay off. Maybe just go off the boat. &gt;&gt; The hell you hear is off the side of the boat. You don't hear it coming from underneath. &gt;&gt; Princess, go explore it. &gt;&gt; Right. She when you when you say when you say, "Do you have your weapon?" She just goes and like this the shadows popping into her hand. Her fangs come down slightly. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I quickly pow her over to the side of the boat and I look over. &gt;&gt; You see what looks like the ruins of a a ship. like if uh roughly a yachtsized vessel had been destroyed. So there's a lot of wood and detritus floating in the water in three incredibly beautiful women are like stuck in it and kind of like holding on to the wood kind of like tangled up in nets and they're like help us please help us. I will explore out of the boat. Uh turns out &gt;&gt; sorry princess that was a mistake of mine stay back. I will be exploring three of these. &gt;&gt; It's on the star brush side. I'm &gt;&gt; sorry. Star burn. I mean, I'm sorry, ladies. &gt;&gt; Can I roll athletics for an awesome front flip? &gt;&gt; You absolutely can. And and and Ron, is it your intent to go over to investigate? &gt;&gt; Uh, yes. Okay. &gt;&gt; I nat 20. You &gt;&gt; tell me. Tell me what before you give me your net 20. Give me athletics for you to try and be cool. Coming down. non-nat 20. So 18. &gt;&gt; So natural 20. You look great, but you tell me what you do uh as as you go over. &gt;&gt; Um All right. So I I walk up. I I take some some spare like loose leaf and cloth in my pocket. I stuff my bulge. I make, you know, and it worked. It's like that looks that looks like you got right fluid mechanics. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh I walk over and like I try I try to I don't care if I have 20. I try to flick a cigarette. I don't catch it. I act like I was going for my hair. &gt;&gt; I'm like, "Ladies, ladies, hello. Have you ever Have you ever had sex with a dead man before?" &gt;&gt; We're going to be dead women if you don't move a little faster. &gt;&gt; I've had sex with plenty of dead women. Sorry. Uh &gt;&gt; that is &gt;&gt; sentient. &gt;&gt; That's not what I mean. Uh undead women. It's a different It's different than dead. I don't really get it yet. I haven't played the game long. I don't really get it yet. Uh, sorry. Been alive. Uh, would you like to have sex with me? I don't know. I've never really done this part. &gt;&gt; It's It's like Do you jump off? &gt;&gt; This is an athletic joke. &gt;&gt; Selena gives you the slow look and she's like, "Yorgi needs help." &gt;&gt; No, no. I've been talking to him. He's He'll come around &gt;&gt; in with your natural 20. &gt;&gt; 18. &gt;&gt; No, I said 18. &gt;&gt; What does a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] one look like? for my 18. Can one of them be like his in their head like this bulge looks pretty good actually? &gt;&gt; They're not. It's not. It's &gt;&gt; you athletically packed your pants and then and then harass them. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; it is a skill. I would &gt;&gt; The athletics is them not noticing I packed it on the way home. &gt;&gt; I've been told by other people it's a necessary skill. But Gork with your natural 20. &gt;&gt; I grab my trident and I pull it off and I start [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] twirling it around and then I like and the the the mass pole I like I run at it and I run up it like a ninja and I go and I run up and then I push off back flip right and I'm doing a flip and while I'm in the sky, the magic of Horizon right behind me, beautiful turtle woman god. Horizon. And it like echoes and then I do a swan dive &gt;&gt; into the water. No splash. &gt;&gt; We never give him a 20 ever again. &gt;&gt; No splash. &gt;&gt; You do like they turn and look and like uh Selenia just looks at you and she goes, "I'm going to go get the others and like turns and starts to run off." Meanwhile, midway back under the deck, the apothecary stands there looking at the two of you and he goes, "Well, sorry. I just didn't know if we'd have a chance to chat like that again." Big fan. Big fan. Uh, give me Arcana or Investigation. Whichever one is higher and you can roll it with advantage. See, roll it twice. Take the highest. &gt;&gt; Two time. Two time. 19. Not natural. &gt;&gt; So, looking at this person, so some artificers like you were engineers. Um, but some artificers are basically chemists. They make potions. And as you're sort of like looking at this person, you're like, "Oh, that's for sure that's their thing." Like now that you can actually see them up close, see the runes, see what's on their person. &gt;&gt; Ah, okay. I get it. So the artificers who can become engineers, the ones who can't do this. That's fun. &gt;&gt; What have you, Bill? &gt;&gt; I suppose. &gt;&gt; Oh, what does this do? Uh, eats flesh. &gt;&gt; You've got a flamethrower cat. Like I mean like &gt;&gt; that's cool. That's That's cool, right? &gt;&gt; It is cool. &gt;&gt; That's cool. He thinks that's cool. You complimented it immediately. &gt;&gt; Give me um either intimidation or deception. Whichever is higher. &gt;&gt; 17. Intimidation. &gt;&gt; You see there? Cuz they have cherry red skin. But it starts to become almost purple as they're look. What have I done? What have I done? Soon everyone will know. Ain't nobody going to know what you made. You don't make [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You look at what other people make. You're a goddamn viewer, bro. &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; what who is this person anyway? &gt;&gt; I I don't know, but he seems like he's getting upset. And &gt;&gt; they they got big nipples. That's what they got. &gt;&gt; They They seem They seem upset. They seem like they got two pepperonis for me. &gt;&gt; They have my dad. They've captured my dad. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; That they're going to kill my dad. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Start with that. &gt;&gt; Obviously start with that. &gt;&gt; Oh, I suppose that changes things, huh? &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Don't I &gt;&gt; You got Colecock. &gt;&gt; Don't say that. His name is Jordan. &gt;&gt; No, you got Cole Cockazul. &gt;&gt; Coco. Oh. &gt;&gt; Oh, there's &gt;&gt; He's going to have a cold [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] soon enough. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I fought in the war with him. &gt;&gt; He just takes a takes a step back. &gt;&gt; Fought in the war with your father. &gt;&gt; My dad didn't fight in the war. &gt;&gt; He goes, "No, that was his grandfather that you fought with." That's why he inherited the bow. Few generations. Yes. Right. Cuz it skips generations apparently. Listen. Um, and you see they do turn their head and they kind of look off in the distance and they're like, "Um, I'm almost at my appointed destination." So, I will have to continue this soon. Um, before we go, um, Leonus, just when you realize what's about to happen next, I know all of you. And you hear Selena, Selenia, Leonus, Stone Beard, like coming down the stairs. Why are you looking at me? &gt;&gt; I don't How do &gt;&gt; I'm an open book. Everybody knows me. I drink. I went to the war. &gt;&gt; You don't get a prize. &gt;&gt; Am I Am I close to you? &gt;&gt; Uh close to &gt;&gt; Yeah, you kind of took a step back for the bow. But I mean, you could get to them if you wanted to. &gt;&gt; I want to re I want to try and reach I I want to try and reach for your uh your potions and cuz you threat you threatened us before. Same thing when you your hand just goes right through them and they say there is one thing and it reaches down. &gt;&gt; Now the third time it's going to work &gt;&gt; and pick something up. It is like coots 7.0. &gt;&gt; It is not ador as adorable and rustic as your coots, but it's a little bigger. It's like more lifelike. like it actually looks like a cat and yet also there's like a bigger flamethrower connection on because like um I made this as my senior project in school. Um &gt;&gt; I just figured there was no point in doing anything &gt;&gt; kind of ugly. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; Stone Beard's Coots is way better than that one. &gt;&gt; You don't you don't have to do all that. &gt;&gt; Yours is great. &gt;&gt; I Well, I know it's great. I love coots. &gt;&gt; And we're going to stop you. Meanwhile, outside. So, Ron, to be clear, was it your intent to go down towards &gt;&gt; I'm gonna go down as well. Yeah, &gt;&gt; perfect. Um, is you sort of get down there. You see all three of them are like, "Oh my goodness. Thank you so much." And like one of them runs up and just hugs you, Gorg. &gt;&gt; It's all good. Everything's fine. &gt;&gt; Wait, were we on land or in water? &gt;&gt; Water. Like, so like there's the big gallion you were on. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. And this is almost like if somebody like busted up another So they're like in the debris of the big boat. &gt;&gt; Yeah, they're like in the debris field. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. Babes kind of clinging the logs and like that. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Babes, what happened? &gt;&gt; Ron, as you get down there, uh as you get a little closer, um &gt;&gt; I pencil dive, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Uh both of you give me investigation checks. &gt;&gt; Um nine. &gt;&gt; Perfect. &gt;&gt; 15. This all seems legit. Both of it. It's like you're looking at these like beautiful women. They just say, "Wait, didn't didn't you have um is it just the two of you?" &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's just me and my wife. &gt;&gt; Just us. Really? All you need? Kind of a one-stop shop. &gt;&gt; Okay. And they they like look at each other. &gt;&gt; Just the two of you. That's good. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I guess. Why are you saying that? &gt;&gt; Um and as they turn and look at you, even while she's hugging you, she kind of leans back. And when she pulls her face back, she's not beautiful. She's this awful, horrible hagw woman. She's got green uh skin like seaweed. She's got a grayish glistening scaly skin almost like this Lovecrafty and Fish Monster nightmare. &gt;&gt; Ah, &gt;&gt; yeah. This is all fine with me still, &gt;&gt; right? You're like, "This all seems legit." And both of you give me wisdom saves. I will tell you in advance, these creatures are the embodiment of save or suck. They have very easy saves, but very bad things happen if you do not make those saves. &gt;&gt; Okay, I got a 10. &gt;&gt; That is not enough. Okay, perfect. &gt;&gt; 19. &gt;&gt; That is enough. &gt;&gt; Damn it. Um, Ron, as all three of these uh creatures kind of reveal themselves, uh, you are frightened of them as an unusual fear kind of grips your heart. &gt;&gt; Uh, which is going to have some other consequences here. And I need actually all four of you to roll initiative. I realize you two aren't there yet, but go ahead and roll it cuz I'm going to account account for everybody here. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. One. Get that out of your system cuz again, easy saves but incredibly negative repercussions if you do not make those saves. &gt;&gt; 24 total. &gt;&gt; Don't be an issue. &gt;&gt; Uh, sorry. 20 bottom. &gt;&gt; Dirty or natural? &gt;&gt; 20. Unnatural. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Natural 20. &gt;&gt; I rolled a six on the die. &gt;&gt; I will say uh because he is magically frightened, you're going to hear Ran sort of yelling through the wall here as as all of this is kind of starting to go wrong outside. uh in the apothecary turns and looks at you and just says, "I will give your father your regards." And they vanish. &gt;&gt; Wait, wait. &gt;&gt; Disappear. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; dude. If only we tried to grab him one more time. &gt;&gt; I thought I just He threatened me with a potion, so I thought maybe I could grab the potions. &gt;&gt; Your father's a strong man. &gt;&gt; Ran, &gt;&gt; he lived a good life. &gt;&gt; That's Ran yelling. &gt;&gt; Oh, Ran. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. It's okay. It's just ugly. That it's not the &gt;&gt; That's the problem. I was down. &gt;&gt; I was down. It's not really it. &gt;&gt; Yes, you all are down in the hole. But we also establish that there's rows of cannons on both sides of me, baby. So, look throughout. &gt;&gt; So, say there there's a port hole you can see maybe scramble out of. &gt;&gt; I see through a small hole created by your bow that &gt;&gt; they seem to be on some debris with rubbing your shoulders. Ugly women. Okay. It's okay. &gt;&gt; It is your turn though, Leonas. I think they're there with your mother. &gt;&gt; That's not with my mother. That's not my mother. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. That's not my mother. &gt;&gt; Sorry. &gt;&gt; Striking. &gt;&gt; Don't call him Coldcock. &gt;&gt; He's about to You were on deck, by the way. So, sorry. &gt;&gt; The apothecary said he's going to die. Hold. I I'm looking. I'm next to a cannon, right? &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; I'm going to push the cannon out of the way &gt;&gt; and try to fire one uh arrow. All right, let me do it like this. It make it a little a little easier for you to see. There's three of them. Each of you give me one of your dice. Each of you you have like the the specific colored ones that are just yours. Uh I believe, don't you have your custom set? That is you with that silvery one. &gt;&gt; Ran, we will say that is you with the brownish one. Well, you're not there yet, but we'll we'll we'll bring it in. And we'll say that this is the broadside of me, baby. Right. M. So, as you look out, you can see these three horrible creatures. One of which is still actively hugging Gorg, but like looking at him like, right. Uh, you see Ran is beginning to panic over here. And there's a third unencumbered one. And actually, you can give me your two dice. We'll just say for our purposes, you two are sort of here on the edge of the ship. We'll say kind of looking out of port looking out of cannon holes. Okay. &gt;&gt; All right. So, what would you like to do, L? &gt;&gt; This is a tough This is a tough shot, but I want to save uh I want to save Rome. So, I'm going to take a I take a shot over over him onto the the evil woman that damn apple off his head from the boat that's rocking as you are looking. Uh, actually, give me you just give me a wisdom check. Not a save, just a check. Since you're from this part of the world, you might know something about these creatures. &gt;&gt; 19. &gt;&gt; Yes. So, total &gt;&gt; these are sirens. Um, and you know, &gt;&gt; who could have guessed? &gt;&gt; Beautiful women who are acting strange. &gt;&gt; I thought sirens were hot the whole time. &gt;&gt; Thought it was finally my time. &gt;&gt; So, it may well be your time. Uh, so this is what you know, Leonus. If you look at them, their magic can affect you. Okay. &gt;&gt; So, you can avert your eyes, which will give you advantage on the save, but will give you disadvantage on the attack, &gt;&gt; right? So, you can look right at them and shoot them, but you have a chance to fall victim to their magic. &gt;&gt; Or you can kind of kind of like h and it'll make it more likely that you'll save, but less likely that you can shoot them. &gt;&gt; All right, Stone Beard, watch this. &gt;&gt; I know the seas. I know the way the sea moves better than any of you. And I'm gonna hit this shot without looking these sirens in the eye. &gt;&gt; Disadvantage. I will. So you roll twice and take the highest. Uh I will give you that bit of knowledge about the sirens because presumably Leon is meant to impart. What was it? &gt;&gt; 17 total. &gt;&gt; You know, Ran, you are standing there just like &gt;&gt; I'm trying to I'm trying to like &gt;&gt; and an arrow just whizzes right past your head in like center mass on one of these sirens. &gt;&gt; Did I get him so beard? You get to attack twice. Ran, don't forget. &gt;&gt; I don't even notice it. I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; It's okay, bro. They're just ugly. &gt;&gt; All right, next one's going to hit two. &gt;&gt; Ooh. &gt;&gt; Oh, I hit lower. Okay, 20 total. &gt;&gt; Um, that is enough. So, just give me two damage rolls when you got it. It's like And you see she doesn't go like right. Uh, however, Stone Beard, it is your turn. You You very much see him averting his eyes, shooting. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, uh, I'm not so good with the range. Uh, so you keep doing this. You're doing well. Uh, &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh, I start to get into the cannon. Uh, &gt;&gt; it's a canon cannon. &gt;&gt; I know. &gt;&gt; And and I got most of my lower half in. And then, uh, I I use I use rage. So, I'm I'm pink. My shirt's off. &gt;&gt; Sia, &gt;&gt; wait. Won't this blow your legs off? &gt;&gt; Sia, can you just light the damn cannon? Can you light the damn cannon, please? &gt;&gt; This seems like a &gt;&gt; trust Selenia. Trust Stone beard. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm looking out for &gt;&gt; He's not even greased. &gt;&gt; Leonest, her hair is down. Her shirt's kind of unbuttoned. It's also kind of like a middrift thing, but she was just with Gorg alone. &gt;&gt; Helenia, you look you look beautiful. moment rack. You look &gt;&gt; Are you in a cannon right now? &gt;&gt; Yeah. From the can. It's And it like echoes cuz it's in a cannon. I go compliment her naval naval. &gt;&gt; What? It's not It's not too many too many. But oh, hang on. We can So, &gt;&gt; this is really cute. You guys should be something. &gt;&gt; I'm Stone Beard and this is the terror. &gt;&gt; Okay, wait. Hang on. How am I How am I going to do you getting fired out of the can? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Make it work, Magic Man. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; It's Yeah. No, I'm going to Okay. All right. What What is your intent from being fired out of &gt;&gt; damn fly over there? Maybe hit one of them on the way. Who knows? &gt;&gt; Holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; I'm going fly across. I'm going to close the gap. I'mma swing. &gt;&gt; Great. &gt;&gt; Looney Tunes. &gt;&gt; Okay. First, just give me athletics. Evil Convvil did it. &gt;&gt; Well, yeah, cuz that's the that's the benchmark. Yes, &gt;&gt; 13. &gt;&gt; I I feel like a cannon fire needs more than 13. &gt;&gt; 13. Yeah, it's low. &gt;&gt; Pretty good number. &gt;&gt; Also, also I did 20 total damage. &gt;&gt; Perfect. 20 total damage. You even hear as you're screaming at these things and these arrows, I mean, it leaves holes in it like as it's hissing and screaming here. How am I going to All right. Here. No. All right. Now I got it. Long wire, eh? [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Why is this cannon say acme? &gt;&gt; So, here's what I'm going to say, Stone Beard. &gt;&gt; I'm going to let this work. I'm going to let you attack, but you were also going to take the cannon damage that your target takes as well, cuz the cannonball is under your feet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And going to come too. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's going to hurt. So, there is currently an unencumbered siren. Or do you intend to shoot at one of the currently? Or you could try and drop it right in the middle and hit everybody, including your friends. &gt;&gt; I was going for an AoE. &gt;&gt; You two give me deck saves. &gt;&gt; Um 18. &gt;&gt; That is enough cuz uh being frightened does not affect your decks. &gt;&gt; Six. &gt;&gt; That is You are going to take that uh as well. &gt;&gt; Get ready to take some hurt. So, we will resolve we'll resolve the cannonball damage, but presu we will assume you have in fact wy coyotied your way over here. What is it that you intend to do? &gt;&gt; I explode out and there's a pink shimmer that follows me cuz I'm in rage. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; And then they start to see me. It almost looks like when Team Rocket blasts off but in reverse. &gt;&gt; Prepare for trouble and make it double. Yep. &gt;&gt; And then they just hear me yelling the whole time. A and then I go right in the middle and explodes the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] deck and except for where you're standing &gt;&gt; again. I know. I just I'm I don't even notice, but I do scoot over so it doesn't hit me &gt;&gt; and then I doggy paddle up to the raft. &gt;&gt; You're like &gt;&gt; one of my one of my legs is blown smooth off. So here I'm going to let you roll. That is 8d10. If you would uh roll roll those, that is 8d10. Canon damage. &gt;&gt; That's cannon damage. Yep. &gt;&gt; Dude, you might die. &gt;&gt; You might die. &gt;&gt; I'm in rage. I take half. &gt;&gt; You're not. All right. So, let's see here. &gt;&gt; Dude, &gt;&gt; that's six. &gt;&gt; That's a lot of zeros. &gt;&gt; 10 20. Yeah, that's not that's not a dead. 27 28 &gt;&gt; 29. Uh 34 points of damage out of a possible 80. &gt;&gt; 17. Yeah. &gt;&gt; 34. Are you still up there? &gt;&gt; I'm up. I'm okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh, however, however, &gt;&gt; that would that have just killed me if I &gt;&gt; just one shot &gt;&gt; if I didn't hit my deck throw. &gt;&gt; No, I one shot you for sure. No. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you're getting hit with a cannon. However, however, &gt;&gt; the siren that Leon killed me &gt;&gt; the the siren that Leona shot only had 32 hit points left. So, tell me what it looks like. Is this this siren takes two in the chest and then the cannon goes off? Tell me what happens. like so me as the cannonball flies down and the way that it hits the debris it's that like you see Ran standing on like a small piece of wood unaffected but right behind him like when you drop a like a stone into water that effect where the water shoots up sends that that son of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] flying. She goes sky high uh and then falls down and just cracks her head. It's really it's a hard thing to look at. just cracks her skull on some debris. &gt;&gt; One is blown away &gt;&gt; and the other who are the other two sirens hit. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, they they are hit. They are damaged. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; they're just hit by shrapnel and debris. My leg is blown smooth off to be clear. I do not have a left leg right now. &gt;&gt; Uh &gt;&gt; could he do that? Could you be missing a leg? &gt;&gt; You may not want to be missing a leg. So I'm going to say it it's J. Both legs are blowing smooth off. &gt;&gt; You're full Lieutenant Dan right now out in the water. Actively bleeding in sharkinfested waters. Perfect. Great. Wonderful. Uh, however, it is now the uh the hag's turn or the sirens rather. Uh, your turn comes later. Ladies first. &gt;&gt; I It's like I I hear just a winging in my head. It's like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] This flashbang went off in Call of Duty. Like &gt;&gt; I look at the siren. I see. I go, "Mrs. Aul, good to meet you. Oh, &gt;&gt; and I barely hear that. Like, that's so funny. &gt;&gt; So, ran. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Remember remember when I said this is an easy save but incredibly detrimental if you don't make it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; One of the remaining sirens, the one that was unencumbered, just looks at you and says, "Die." And you feel like daggers of ice in your heart because even though the siren that scared you is gone, the frightened condition is not gone. So, I need a wisdom save. It is a low wisdom save, but it is very bad if you do not make this save. &gt;&gt; Please God, you just die. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Kind of. &gt;&gt; Oh god. Seven. &gt;&gt; That ain't high enough. You don't have to ask. &gt;&gt; You all see Ran just drops to zero hit points. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Collapses. Just like staring up at the sky. Just terror etched across his face. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; he's dead. question mark &gt;&gt; again. &gt;&gt; You heard her yell out die. Uh and you all see him drop to the ground. Uh the other one that has you engaged. Here's the thing. I was like, how hard should I go with these things? And then I'm like, well, one of them's dead and two of them are grievously injured. So hard. Um this &gt;&gt; I'm also grievously injured. looks looks at you, Gorg, and just sort of like rubs your head very gently with this like clawed gooey hand that kind of leaves almost like a snail trail &gt;&gt; on across your face and looks at you and just says, "Year is delicious. &gt;&gt; I don't have fear. I roll better. I don't have it." &gt;&gt; Give me a wisdom say &gt;&gt; Gal. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that'd be funny if I was awake. Don't give into your fear. Nine. &gt;&gt; I'm not afraid of you. Your weird [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] slime on my face. &gt;&gt; York. Uh, for those of you that home that know what this is, she activates Fantasmal Killer. &gt;&gt; Oh, you fantasmal killer. &gt;&gt; Is that bad? &gt;&gt; It's bad. You see the thing that you are most afraid of. Fantasma kill. It's Freddy Krueger. The thing you're most afraid of appears for you and begins harming you. So what is Gorg most afraid of &gt;&gt; because for you that is here and it is like happening but it's not like conceptual like oh I'm naked at school. It's like no a thing is here harming you &gt;&gt; like a genjuts too. &gt;&gt; I tell you what I'm going to give you a second because that is all they're going to do. So you ponder it. We'll we'll come we'll come back to it and resolve it in a second. Uh because &gt;&gt; beating you off. rough hands. &gt;&gt; Ran &gt;&gt; zero hit points is not technically dying. It's just unconscious. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But is I go to Mory? Where do I go? &gt;&gt; As you are laying there, you hear the crash of the waves all around you get louder and more deafening. And you do find yourself in that place that you've now been to a couple of times that is just kind of nothing. It's just sort of a grayish amorphous mass. And off in the distance, you see that light that you've seen every time that is almost like the full moon behind clouds. And you see Horizon. You've met him before. Uh he is tall. He is muscular. He looks like he's wearing armor made out of coral. Has sort of grayish blonde dreads. &gt;&gt; Mh. um and is just sort of looking at you and he says, "hm, you seem to have gotten yourself in a bit of a predicament." &gt;&gt; Yeah, sorry. I'm back. &gt;&gt; I know. It's like a lot in a short period of time. &gt;&gt; Well, good news, bad news. &gt;&gt; We go good news first. &gt;&gt; Good news. You're not dead yet. Well, besides the &gt;&gt; That's why the creeping knights. &gt;&gt; That's No, that's good. &gt;&gt; He start You know how he likes to monologue. Yeah, I do have seven days though. Okay. All right. What's the bad news? &gt;&gt; You may not have seven days actually based on the uh bad news. Your death may well be imminent, especially if your friends activate the two remaining cannons on the edge of the ship or anything of that nature. &gt;&gt; Are you saying that we shouldn't have thought? &gt;&gt; No. No, not saying that at all. I'm just saying that um maybe you should have thought ahead before you jumped into the arms of strange women calling for help in the ocean. I mean, I felt like sirens were common. Now, actually, you shouldn't have known. Gorg should have known. &gt;&gt; It's never faulted me in the past. I you know, beautiful women are constantly asking me to get in the pool. &gt;&gt; Is that true that it's not faulted you in the past? Is that is that true? &gt;&gt; How smart are you like one of those like omnipotent? &gt;&gt; No, far from then. Yeah, this happens constantly. &gt;&gt; Ah, right. Yes. It's as far as I know. And I I know pretty far. Listen, I have no idea how long it will be before you get snatched back from this place or delivered further to the next world. Um, &gt;&gt; can you impart any wisdom? &gt;&gt; Well, &gt;&gt; onto me. &gt;&gt; Believe it or not, besides wisdom, I wanted to impart gratitude. You're here fighting for my land and my people, and I wanted you to know you have my appreciation. &gt;&gt; Really? No problem. I was like, maybe like eternal salvation for me cuz day is still coming. I don't know that that's in the cards. But should you die in Leo, I might have some pull in your ultimate rest. &gt;&gt; A statue. I want a statue. &gt;&gt; A statue. &gt;&gt; Just at least a statue. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Me bronze. &gt;&gt; Well, I can Well, it might be coral with some detail. &gt;&gt; A bulging coral statue. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Bronze inlay. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Just to be clear here in the face of a god. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's all you want is a a statue of you with a big bulge. &gt;&gt; Cuz I can do that. &gt;&gt; I don't know. I could I could whip something foreign. What do you what else do you have to offer? &gt;&gt; I'm literally a god. &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, can I be alive again? &gt;&gt; Meanwhile, so let's go back a step. &gt;&gt; First of all, what is it that Gorg is afraid of? &gt;&gt; It's headmaster Kench. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; It's John Kench, the headmaster. And he was in private school and he beat the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of me with a ruler. And it's just this this grotesque version of him. He's a catfish. And he's just this grotesque version of him with like giant teeth and he has like 19 hands and they all have rulers and they're just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] slapping me. &gt;&gt; I told you to pay attention in class. I told you to pay attention in class. &gt;&gt; Now, here's how Fantasmal Killer works. Initially, you are simply frightened. You have the the same thing going that Ran had. At the end of your turn, you have to make another save. If you make the save, it breaks and it's all good. If you do not make the save, you start taking not insignificant damage. And that continues. Either you make the save and you get out. &gt;&gt; Oh, every turn. &gt;&gt; Every turn. &gt;&gt; You either get away or you don't. Right. &gt;&gt; Can I also not act? &gt;&gt; No, you can act. Uh, but because you're frightened, it it affects some things. So, it is your turn. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; At the And right now, you in your mind, you are still actively being beaten by this person. This is a headmaster kid. Stop it. &gt;&gt; I don't know who that is, but I sound lovely. &gt;&gt; I wasn't smoking any weed. I promise I wasn't. &gt;&gt; Oh, the seaweed has guided more than one impressionable youth out into me and my sister's arms. &gt;&gt; Ugly fish lady. I hate you so much. &gt;&gt; What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You You all do just hear him screaming and holding his head and talking about John K. &gt;&gt; Bro, Mustard K is so mean. It is however your turn, Gorg. &gt;&gt; Uh, okay. Um, well, in my in my freakout state, I just I I claw for my trident and I just pull it out and I just start swinging wildly. &gt;&gt; Because you are frightened, you have disadvantage. You hit her, but you can't attack. And you have your two attacks and you can smite if you manage to hit them. &gt;&gt; Oh, if I if Let's be clear. I'm smiting. &gt;&gt; Well, yep. So, roll. So you first you roll twice and you take the lower &gt;&gt; 20. I haven't been in combat in a while. &gt;&gt; Yeah, two two d20s. But you roll twice, take the lower. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; seven. &gt;&gt; That is 7 + 6, which is 13, which is not enough. As you just like lunge at her, she just sort of like turns slightly and the the is like, oh, don't want to face me. Are you afraid? &gt;&gt; No, I'm not afraid. It's just a rulers. Why? We don't even use those. &gt;&gt; Roll again. You do get a second attack. A, it won't be long now, sweet boy. 8 plus 14 is enough. &gt;&gt; That's crazy. &gt;&gt; 14 is enough. So, uh, &gt;&gt; and I feel it. I finally feel the trident connect and I'm like, "Oh, it's smiting time." &gt;&gt; So, you're going to give me the damage in a second, but let's revolve some resolve something first here. Give me a wisdom save cuz you're either going to get away from the fantasmal killer or you're going to start taking some damage. &gt;&gt; That's a nine. &gt;&gt; It's a 50/50, isn't it? &gt;&gt; You know what? Uh Leonus, you're usually on the receiving end of this sort of thing. So, I'm going to let you roll the Take the Just those tens, though. Yep. Roll that for me here. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's what you get. Oh, you get some good [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; 12. Is this 10? &gt;&gt; That is 10. 12 22 24. &gt;&gt; How many hit points does Gork have left? &gt;&gt; I have 12 hit points left. &gt;&gt; So &gt;&gt; you are going to hit her. So you you you do give me that damage. &gt;&gt; Stone Beard, you piece of &gt;&gt; But you tell me what you tell me what it what it looks like. Is is John Kench lays you out. &gt;&gt; Headmaster John Kench and I find I I feel I feel the trident bite. And I'm like there that's it. Fight through it. And then all of a sudden the rulers now there there were 20 of them. Now there's like 400 and they're just and it's like Akuma's like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rage art in Street Fighter and it's just like infinite demons and I'm just looking up at them and headmaster Kench is like and I'm telling your mom it's like John Kench is like domain expansion you know behind the shed &gt;&gt; to you guys you don't see anything Jorg just like starts &gt;&gt; he connects he looks up at the sky then he falls Yeah, it starts screaming and collapsing. So, do give me the damage. Do do give me the smite. All of that cuz all of that happens. This brings us back. Well, let's see here. Hold on a second. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. Does he got a horizon? &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to do things slightly differently this time. When Selenia acts and Katagot is on board the on board the ship, too. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You guys can just tell me what you want them to do. I'll handle the numbers and stuff, but I mean like what kindly Selenia is on board with you next to the cannon. Uh so what do you all just want her to do? Do you want her to try and assist? Do you want her to attack? &gt;&gt; First off, she buttons up. &gt;&gt; She's like, this was a mistake. &gt;&gt; She had that weird interaction. Leonus wasn't really appreciative of it. She buttons up. &gt;&gt; It's it's awkward. You know, &gt;&gt; is Leonus in the boat? In the &gt;&gt; No, Leon. Yeah, Leonus is still right next to her run to him. I think Selenia starts to climb into the cannon cuz she saw me do it &gt;&gt; and I'm gonna veto that. She Selenia is not stupid. &gt;&gt; Selenia, please do not get in the cannon. &gt;&gt; Okay. 9 + 6 is 15 + 3 is 18. &gt;&gt; 18. Perfect. Okay, &gt;&gt; here we go. K. &gt;&gt; Not bad, dude. That's not bad, dude. &gt;&gt; I wish I wasn't dead. &gt;&gt; I did 34 to four people. I'm beast. &gt;&gt; You're not You're not dead. You're dying. 18. &gt;&gt; All right. What should you do? What you do? Can I Can I teleport with her if I use misty step? &gt;&gt; No, cuz she weighs too much. You can only take You can only take &gt;&gt; She's not too much. &gt;&gt; She's What she do, Leon? You're with her. &gt;&gt; Wait, how about you try the Misti step and then you say out loud, "Sorry, you weigh too much." &gt;&gt; Well, it's her turn. It is It is not currently your turn. I'm just I'm just I'm just What you Yeah, that that is that would be the move. That is &gt;&gt; Can you Can you shoot Can you shoot your shadows? Have you tried that? She goes, "Yeah, I mean, well, no, I haven't tried, but I I think I can, but like which which who?" Like the uh the one Well, probably the one that's killing Gorg. &gt;&gt; The one that's killing Gork. &gt;&gt; Okay. Right. Um she goes, &gt;&gt; "Oh, this is such a stupid idea. They're all dead." &gt;&gt; Uh she just says, "Okay." Um, she goes like, but um, and like she just sort of looks at you a second and then she does she does like button up a couple of them again and then like turns back and you see the the shadowy tentacles do come out. Uh, the hag is very beat up, but it it is still it is still on its feet. And what would you all like Katagot to do? Cuz technically she was she was flying overhead as a bird. &gt;&gt; I was going to say I was going to say she should go bird mode. &gt;&gt; I think I think she comes in as a bird. Tries to swoop on up. I think she goes into the water, becomes a whale, goes up and breaches, and then flops on the debris. &gt;&gt; They're still there. &gt;&gt; But &gt;&gt; just hits but just hits her. &gt;&gt; That's not &gt;&gt; Things keep comically missing me by just enough. &gt;&gt; She if if you want her to if you want her to be a fish again, the biggest thing she can turn into is a shark again. But she could be a shark and attack. &gt;&gt; You should be a shark and bite that damn fool. Oh yeah, I like that. Swims into the water. Emerg as a shark. &gt;&gt; You know when great whites like jump out of the water with like a ceiling &gt;&gt; and then they and then they siren. &gt;&gt; To be clear, this one is very injured. This one is kind of injured. &gt;&gt; Is she accurate enough to hit the one on the left without hitting Gorg? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah, they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] go for the little weak one. &gt;&gt; Well, then uh I tell you what, you roll a d4 here &gt;&gt; just to see if she she hits as a shark. &gt;&gt; Don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] us. &gt;&gt; Easy. &gt;&gt; That's a That's a 12. &gt;&gt; D12. &gt;&gt; That's a d12. &gt;&gt; Oh, and I roll the highest. What's wrong with you? &gt;&gt; I don't have a d20. People took my die. &gt;&gt; You used up all your d20. A lot's happening. It's okay. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Let's Let's move. Oh yeah. You're out here on the field already. &gt;&gt; What do you roll? What do you roll? What do you roll? What do you roll? What do you roll? &gt;&gt; Dude, I rolled the 12 out of 12. We should have kept it. &gt;&gt; What'd you get? &gt;&gt; Got an eight. &gt;&gt; Uh, believe it or not, with a that actually is enough. &gt;&gt; Damn. &gt;&gt; She's going to do enough to kill that that siren. You all tell me what what is what does she do as Kataga erupts out of the water attacking this siren. What does it look like? And she kills her. &gt;&gt; She dives in as a bird. You don't even see the transformation. Transformation happens on watch. She goes a shark come out as a shark and she go and she go hump and she and she gets him and then they just leave. She just goes into the water and you just see kind of red pillow out &gt;&gt; and then out of the water shoots a little pigeon &gt;&gt; and the pigeon goes and eyeball pops out. Let's go. &gt;&gt; See, the third siren looks and is like, "You all have accomplished nothing in the great feast that is to come. We will bathe in all of your blood." But that brings us around to the top. Leonus, it is your turn. There is one left. &gt;&gt; Accomplish this, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; I don't usually say things like that, so it's &gt;&gt; How did Selena do that? She's She's taking a back. &gt;&gt; Starts to unbutton slowly again. I I'm trying to channel to shoot Eldrich Blast with like two uh two beams, two green blue beams out of each hand. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; I roll. It's an 18 &gt;&gt; real quick. &gt;&gt; Are you still averting your eyes or are you going to chance looking at it? &gt;&gt; I'm looking at her this time. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, before you shoot, give me a wisdom save. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Again, the difficulty is low. It's just a negative if you don't fail. The ne the difficulty only 11. &gt;&gt; Oh wow. &gt;&gt; Uh I rolled a 16. &gt;&gt; Perfect. You you you are aware but you are resolved at 18 is enough but you &gt;&gt; give me your second attack cuz I believe you're high enough level to have two beams I believe. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Do I do each beam separately? Is that how it works? Okay. &gt;&gt; Two different attacks &gt;&gt; and that's a dirty 20. &gt;&gt; Theoretically you can uh you can crit. So that is two hits. Give me the damage. &gt;&gt; All right. I uh &gt;&gt; you all see this greenish energy crackling out of his &gt;&gt; green blue crackles starts like up from my chest out through my hands beams through the hole where the cannon would be that I pushed pushed it out of the way before &gt;&gt; straight straight onto her. &gt;&gt; Two d10s. &gt;&gt; Uh oh. Uh nine and 15 &gt;&gt; 15 points of damage. Uh you see she just kind of &gt;&gt; sorry sorry plus one on each. So be 17 points of damage, which uh she is badly injured, but she is still standing. Uh and you see Selenia just like looks at you and she just gets this huge smile on her face. She goes, &gt;&gt; "That was pretty cool, &gt;&gt; Leonus. You know that feeling that you have right now? Hold on to it." Because she puts her hands on the side of your face and she goes, "That feeling is hate." And you see her fangs as she like gives you this huge smile. &gt;&gt; I didn't uh I didn't I don't think I've ever dug dug into that before. &gt;&gt; But Stone Beard, your turn, &gt;&gt; guys. I got this. Oh, guys. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The two of them were laid out. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; I take out my axe and I just and I just go for one straight across her damn head and blow it smooth off. &gt;&gt; Give me the attack. I got a roll, baby. Uh 18. &gt;&gt; Uh 18 is enough. &gt;&gt; And the damage done is a seven. Eight. &gt;&gt; Uh I will also give you your Eldrich Cannon. We We didn't talk about summoning it, but Coots has a flamethrower attachment if uh if you want Coots to activate her flamethrower. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Coots turns out I didn't have enough health. Coots hits her with another eight &gt;&gt; uh &gt;&gt; matches, &gt;&gt; which is enough to kill this siren. So you you tell me what Coots's flamethrower does to it. &gt;&gt; So I'm I'm I'm I'm like Coots, you might not be V7, but like you're you're powerful. And Coots like channels kind of Ash Ketchum style a larger attack than she otherwise should have. And and maybe it's just because of the debris, but it's just a fireball. &gt;&gt; Just like Coot's jaw kind of unhooks a little bit. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Also does the Sasuke hand signal for some reason. &gt;&gt; Yeah. it you it's this awful smell of just sort of like burning flesh and you see this siren kind of splashes back into the water and a second later a shark is like pulls it pulls it back down and you all are left there standing on the wreckage as &gt;&gt; I'm not standing &gt;&gt; ran and Gorg uh Ran is only unconscious but Gorg is actively dying &gt;&gt; guys we did York, &gt;&gt; I I I jump out of the ship. I just dive into the water to swim. Did you leave Selenia? &gt;&gt; What? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yorg, you also find yourself in that grayish place, &gt;&gt; but you don't see Rome. But you do see the Temple of Horizon just sitting there in the middle of this nowhere. &gt;&gt; Well, &gt;&gt; with just like waves kind of like lapping up against the steps of it. Ah, I've lived so many so many halftruths and I'm I'm just so calm right now. And I'm so mad. &gt;&gt; Calm and you're mad. &gt;&gt; That is a thing that happens. &gt;&gt; You shouldn't have been in the cannon. I could have just not done that. And now I'm here and it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sucks. &gt;&gt; While you're in there, you're here. &gt;&gt; Canon was a good idea. &gt;&gt; That [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] worked. as you're not able to stand right &gt;&gt; smoking legs. Is he Is he close enough to go towards it? &gt;&gt; Sure. It's like right in front of you. &gt;&gt; I don't want to go anywhere. &gt;&gt; You don't You don't move. &gt;&gt; I don't want to go anywhere. I'm I'm too mad. &gt;&gt; So, you're sitting at the bottom step. Roll a 20. Give me Give me one one death save here. [Applause] &gt;&gt; 12. &gt;&gt; Uh that is enough. is you is you do see the the doors kind of open to the temple. You know what I mean? Like there's sort of an ambient light inside. Uh but you manage just to kind of stay put there as you are kind of &gt;&gt; no &gt;&gt; floating on the wreckage. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Meanwhile, Ran, &gt;&gt; uh you are with Horizon. And again, you see, he sort of like looks past you at something and he says, "Ran, I realize you're not a terribly religious person or moral person or good person or a person." &gt;&gt; I was I was an atheist, but I just keep meeting gods. So, I had to drop that kind. It was kind of hard to &gt;&gt; You know, you'd be surprised how many atheists I've met in my time, and I'm like I'm literally &gt;&gt; I'm still holding out. So, might I ask you a small favor? Your friends have defeated those horrible creatures. I'm sure they're going to rescue you any moment now. &gt;&gt; I I loosened it. &gt;&gt; No, 100%. No, you Well, no. When you were screaming and flailing and they were all looking at you, that gave everyone else a tactical advantage. It &gt;&gt; was like a distraction. &gt;&gt; It's all correct. &gt;&gt; I do high decks. &gt;&gt; There are many lethal creatures in my oceans. Uh, the hags are but one of them. Um, but listen, &gt;&gt; what can I do for you? My son Gorg, he's going through some complicated things. And my other child, Leonus, he this trip home is difficult for them. Family is difficult. And now Gorg has very clearly publicly been beaten up &gt;&gt; in a fight. He also is going to have a problem with being beaten by a girl, which is problematic, but that's I'll let you deal with that with him. Honestly, all my children are equally fearsome. &gt;&gt; But could you just be a little nicer to them? &gt;&gt; I see what you're saying. You want me to be a father to them. &gt;&gt; That isn't at all. &gt;&gt; You want me to step in as a father figure because you can't be around all the time. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; No, I see &gt;&gt; Leonus. What was it that you intended to do as you get to them? Well, and now that everything has stopped, I dive off of the boat and I swim over as fast as possible because I want to heal both of my both of my friends. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Swim very fast and swimming popup. &gt;&gt; We're out of combat. I will allow it. You, Gorg, see the door to the temple opening and you just kind of sit there but refuse to enter. And you are like, "I'll be father to him." And Horizon is like, "That isn't at all what?" And you sort of like sit up and both of you just kind of see Leonus is concerned, right? &gt;&gt; I And I realize I'm back, but I'm like I'm waiting for Leon to give me CPR cuz I think it'd be funny. &gt;&gt; Do I &gt;&gt; I think he's got water in his in his lungs. &gt;&gt; I can't do it cuz I'm the what the blast to the cannon. &gt;&gt; Isn't he amphibious? &gt;&gt; He is amphibious. Gork, &gt;&gt; as they're both rising, we I noticed the whole ship's watching &gt;&gt; cuz there was commotion. So, the whole ship's &gt;&gt; Well, as as you look up, there's a row of like pirates with bows and arrows and musketss and they're loading the cannons. Like, I mean, it's a warship, &gt;&gt; guys. Good. It was just Ran. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I died. So, you could have shot a single anything. Ran and York both died in that fight. &gt;&gt; Hey, but wasn't he dead to begin with? &gt;&gt; It's you racist to say that. Oh, is that problematic? &gt;&gt; You cannot say that. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's I can't say what we all see with our eyes. &gt;&gt; Leonas, you need to you need to put your lips on my lips. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to put my lips on your lips. I can see you're awake now. &gt;&gt; No, you guys. You guys are idiots. You guys I know. Do you even read the scrolls? You guys fell for sirens. &gt;&gt; I that that comment makes me really mad, but I remember the tail end of what Horizon was telling me and I did internalize that message. So at right as I'm about to absolutely flame Leonus in a way that he's not clever enough to retort, I say, "You know what, Leonus? &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; Three beautiful women off the side of the ship. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; Three beautiful women and you guys said you're right." &gt;&gt; Oh. &gt;&gt; And and Ron doesn't really do that very often. You Selenia has kind of like swam out by this point. She does kind of like tug on your sleeve. She's like, "Hey, hey, hey, take the win. Take the win. Take the win." &gt;&gt; I I am right. I am. You need Don't push it. Stone Beard with his innovative &gt;&gt; a spontaneous cannon trick helped save both of you. I &gt;&gt; You're welcome. You're welcome. &gt;&gt; I hit my head really hard. What? &gt;&gt; Yes, you were right. And you are still going to die. Virgin. All right, let's go virgin. Do roll for your heel though because that that might be relevant pending pending what happens here because you all are conscious but you're you're still both actually neither of you look like you have a a scratch on you actually like you you were uh you were hurt but it's like you were you were hurt in your mind basically &gt;&gt; I heal too. &gt;&gt; Oh well he's he's &gt;&gt; I'm going to heal you. Uh okay so I &gt;&gt; just roll it separate. &gt;&gt; It's a little comforting to hear you to hear you say that. &gt;&gt; Anyway, I hold on. It's a beat off to sirenography. &gt;&gt; So anyway, what'd you roll? &gt;&gt; That's great. So &gt;&gt; I mean, host Among Us hasn't. &gt;&gt; You say you say the craziest to the ocean. You &gt;&gt; I'm going to hold on. And I walk between the two of them and I the the green like ball of energy comes out around me, encompasses them. Three for Gorg. Oh, it's for both of them. Um, none rather you put your lips on my lips. It's free HP. It's nothing to me. &gt;&gt; You all do feel this healing kind of uh go through you here. Um, and we have one HP since it keeps going. Well, it keeps healing. So, for our purposes, you'll you'll you'll be fine here. Um, however, &gt;&gt; as you all sort of stand up in a kind of sitting there for a moment, um, Selenia looks at you and she goes, "Um, what were you guys doing down there anyway? Look, I mean, I I knew you kind of were like, &gt;&gt; "The apothecary was on the ship." &gt;&gt; The apothecary was on me, baby. &gt;&gt; Can I say what I saw? &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; I walked in on Leonus having sex with the apothecary, &gt;&gt; my man. &gt;&gt; Wait, really? &gt;&gt; Stone Beard, &gt;&gt; that's crazy. &gt;&gt; I was not having sex with the apothecary &gt;&gt; tentacles, which were still active. Just she just goes, "It's okay. I mean, we don't I mean, we weren't I It's It just starts breaking the siren's body. &gt;&gt; That's like You just hear this like sickening crunch. Is it still holding on to it? &gt;&gt; I wasn't having sex with the apothecary. &gt;&gt; You don't owe me. &gt;&gt; It's okay. &gt;&gt; I get it. It's okay. &gt;&gt; The ones that got us sick, you've had sex with. &gt;&gt; Why would you do that? &gt;&gt; Do you think that would kill them? &gt;&gt; Please listen to me. Please listen to me for once. Everyone listen to the sex haver. &gt;&gt; So weird. &gt;&gt; And she, you see, she's like aggressively butting in it up and like pulling her shirt back down and tucking it in. &gt;&gt; I respect you deeply, but I feel like what happened down there went a little over your head. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Apparently under your &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; The apothecary is going to kill my father. They are going to kill my father if we do not retreat. That's what they said. They appeared. We We both tried. We both tried once &gt;&gt; appropriately the apothecary too &gt;&gt; to hit to hit the matter and first off they would be so lucky. &gt;&gt; Okay. And what do you know about sex? &gt;&gt; I have read the scrolls but it's you know what you know what you know what that you're catching strays. You're catching strays. Don't be &gt;&gt; for no reason. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. Like you got busted up legs. &gt;&gt; I might have been wrong. I think it was a diversion to distract me ultimately. you before you were there. They said a bunch of things about us. They said all of our what we're like. &gt;&gt; Oh, that feels so good. &gt;&gt; They can impersonate other voices. &gt;&gt; Said that. Okay, &gt;&gt; that's what I heard. &gt;&gt; They can impersonate voices. &gt;&gt; Stone Bread heard it. &gt;&gt; I heard it. Yeah. With my own ears. &gt;&gt; Stone beards a lot of things, but he's not a liar. But okay. So anyway, I think it might have been fake Selenia because they were actually not tangible. &gt;&gt; When we attempted to apprehend them, they phazed through. So &gt;&gt; what did they want? &gt;&gt; Well, at best he could have beat off around them. &gt;&gt; Not what I meant. &gt;&gt; Oh, sorry. It was clear that they wanted us to turn around. I think we are headed in the right direction, but they threatened to kill Leonus's father, &gt;&gt; Coldcock. No way. &gt;&gt; Yeah, cold cockazul. &gt;&gt; I've heard of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Please just call Please just call him Jordan when I'm around. &gt;&gt; Jordan Cold Cockazul &gt;&gt; might die. My mom has a lot of stories about him. &gt;&gt; So, we have to make the decision. If we keep going, we will meet the apothecary. &gt;&gt; Chance we are the reason his father dies. &gt;&gt; Well, if we go, we have a chance to save him. But if we don't go, both of us will die. &gt;&gt; I'll leave it up to you, Leon. It's your father. But, you know, &gt;&gt; I'll I'll also leave it up to you. &gt;&gt; My father would never want me to to give up on a mission. And there's there's so much more at stake. I We need to We need to keep going. &gt;&gt; Even if Cold [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dies. &gt;&gt; Please don't call him Cold. &gt;&gt; Your father also didn't want you to take dance, but you &gt;&gt; you took dance. &gt;&gt; You took dance instead. &gt;&gt; There's only like four. &gt;&gt; I thought I thought your gracefulness was one of your most enduring traits, but whatever. &gt;&gt; And just still like like just like this siren is like all like a ball. It's got trash compacted. No bones left. It's just staring at these tentacles. &gt;&gt; It endures. It It doesn't endur. You saw my dive. &gt;&gt; I also &gt;&gt; They saw my dive, too. It was sick. &gt;&gt; But they also threatened that they were going to do something. I don't know. The vibes were that the whole of Leica would be infected with some illness if I were gathering correctly. So as you are explaining this vital exposition, two things happen. As the ship has still been moving during all the, you know, the ocean never really stops and those storm clouds that you kind of saw up ahead are over you now as it just sort of starts to rain. And all of you give me survival, but Leonus and Gorg can give me survival with advantage because you're from this part of the world. Survival, baby girl. Yeah. &gt;&gt; 10. &gt;&gt; 10's low, baby. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Average. &gt;&gt; 11. &gt;&gt; Slightly above. &gt;&gt; Sorry. &gt;&gt; 21. &gt;&gt; And &gt;&gt; can you do something for me? &gt;&gt; Seven. Is you all are talking and Leonus, you're you're listening to Stone Beard talk about the apothecary and realize that Selenia is clearly very upset. You look down at the water and you notice the currents all wrong. Like it's moving in the wrong direction. Like literally moving the wrong direction. And as you sort of like look around and kind of survey, you see around the boat, a huge whirlpool &gt;&gt; is starting to form. Meanwhile, elsewhere, back at the shattered cove, up out of the water, a very large shape starts to form. Almost looks like a bony carropus, like a platform. And on the back of it is a row of trebuchets, catapults, three of them that just goes, and something starts hurtling towards the shattered cove. But as it branches outward, it starts to sparkle and glint as gold coins are being shot towards the city off of the back of whatever this is. And of course, the people kind of immediate initially dodge cuz obviously gold coming down would be kind of painful. But then they stop and oh, and they start just scoping up these like gold coins and like putting them into pockets and things and like cheering and like wait asking for more. And you see the trebuchese just slowly start to reload as robed figures keep pouring gold coins into the trebuchets and getting ready to fire again. And that is a good place for us to stop. &gt;&gt; Putting the coins in their mouth. &gt;&gt; Got to be a good sign. &gt;&gt; Is this real? &gt;&gt; I bet it's just a really rich guy. &gt;&gt; A really generous guy &gt;&gt; wants to give back. Just give
