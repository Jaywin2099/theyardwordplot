in the first place that oh that's actually the guy who has it in the first place you don't I have the picture because Genesis happened this weekend and as you know Genesis was the same weekend as Valentine's Day so me and Aiden you know did what any sensible boyfriend would do and we went to the melee event and we dished our girlfriends bad boyfriend's alerts we left our you were also Genesis oh not on Valentine's Day it's true he come later we still still trying to figure that out no one knows for sure where you were um but me and Aden were definitely hanging out and we were at Genesis and our girlfriends hung out with each other okay um yeah they spent Valentine's Day together and they did like a they did like a yoga day which her parents came to yeah are they doing okay like her parents are like happy they're doing phenomenal they're doing great you actually have no shot here damn they go around the country in a van together oh my and they hike a lot your angle here your angle here maybe is like he your husband he only can hike 20 miles I can hike 30 it's night time it's night time and they got to pick a movie how's it going like it's just them too and they got to pick a movie to watch like what's the ration now is is it is he like whatever you want or is it like I get to pick the movie he seems like the type that would have a suggestion top of head but would happily go with his he going watch her movie he's going every time every time they're going to watch the notebook or the B Movie okay you're well now you're assuming something about notbook the movie two especially especially women in their 60s she's in her 60s yeah she's a parent of a of of of a damn 30-year-old they're fit for 60 dude it's cuz all they do is hike they hike and run you got some crunchy ass granola ass step parents that's going to be great parents and- laws well welcome back to the art episode 99 I got an idea okay uh not anthers ladder um mancer ladder and instead of matching up for ver melee sets you match up to get answers from other men from adult men who have good advice they have good advice but also cool Tri yeah like dynamite is weighs this much that's a maner dynamite weighs this much weighs 100 p and I still have to receive the advice from regular friends and I hate it but I have to heed heed the advice you're just making Ask Jeeves yeah but it's populated by real man Jes isn't a man yeah je is a servants can't be men yes they can and Jes was one Jes was never a marine Jes was never Jes was a servant but wasn't a man Jes was too effeminate Jes had that clear cone it wasn't was G's NB like what are we talking about just jees was a je je je just washed clothes with his their hands it's it's Jette now was Genie was jeie from Aladdin NB Genie from Aladdin's a man he had blue hair no he was didn't he didn't have leg he didn't have leg at all he's a genie he was he was so he was so he made his whole body blew the reason he was a man it what was this he's a genie talk you gen are they're a genie no the genie is not non-binary why are you putting your foot in the sand I think I think it's less likely that the gender binary would apply to Genies I think it would certainly apply aren't Genies dead guys they're like magical beings but they start as humans who become Genies so you presumably drop gender on the way out that's what I'm saying doesn't doesn't death kind of wipe that slate you got to be leaving gender at the door if you become a genie yeah I think that makes a lot of sense we can only inter you think you've been in the bottle you've been in the bottle 2,000 years you're coming out and you're still locked in on whether you're a man or woman bury me with my pronouns that's that's high key hbox would be buried with lway GD they them this is this is like this is like if people start like removing gender from dead people it's going to be Republicans on their Tombstone putting pronouns just to remember it was he him yeah just remember it was he him yeah that's actually a fun I'm taking it with me y don't need to know well I I I didn't have a girlfriend to uh bail on a Genesis so I just went normally he yeah okay so it's still very f a very fashionable way to do it you know fashion I went to the prom alone yeah going Hello nice to meet you fellow Smasher I don't have a girlfriend it's not like oh you don't also have a girl you the bracket for others who are like you a great way make sing it's like it's the regular it's the bra it's the regular yeah it's it's funny it's called The Singles we were we were joking about uh how the me and Shake were talking about what's the most EX outcome of Genesis possible I I did float the idea of of Juan Deb edma winning I said that would be pretty cool he hasn't won in a while but we agreed that the actual hypest outcome would be meww king winning if uh if he won the tournament that'd be insane by All Odds and we were saying that uh and for the first time ever even though they've always been there all of the South Africans in the crowd would stand up and all start waving their flags and they be singing the National Anthem finally we have a breakout player yeah after all this this time we're finally represented it would be all all the people in South Africa that he's convinced to do things for him this is the guy that drives me around re rewriting Invictus so instead of Matt Damon it's Morgan Freeman to just telling Mew King we needs to win Genesis to bring the nation together he puts on a Crown he's a white king we're all we're all going to get power if you do this it'll be awesome that would rule I think also one one extremely hype outcome would would have been Aiden winning I mean no but like I know you can say anybody that's like say you know what would be really hyped what Megatron showed up shut uput dude and then it had sex with us like Emily R coming out of the crowd and proposing to me it's not like there after after I beat Graves again imagine Aiden and he's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bald and he's sitting there and the camera's on him and he's on the Genesis stage and he's like wiping his hands H AC and he's locking in you know and he's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ball as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and everyone's like it's just crazy that he's a podcast he just he just said [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for the 30th time I just hit a parlay I got like he's like raging I got like 20K such an easy over Aiden today dude cursing like a sailor yeah I the issue is I would hate to see Aiden in a top eight of a major tournament not because I don't want to see him Thrive but because when he loses he will kill himself he will kill himself I want to see him or his opponent uh he won't kill his he kill himself he doesn't have the Constitution it's going to be mo X2 I think he tried to punch his opponent swinging it it would he'd punch himself punch himself so hard that his his face would go inside out Am I Wrong why did you say like Scooby dud Am I Wrong tell him he's wrong tell me I'm wrong okay here's what happened I mean we already have evidence Aiden would swing on triff triff would just stand still the punch would miss he'd spin around fall in a chair Million Dollar Baby himself we got to pull the plug yeah we I pulled him instantly I don't want you to suffer and then you'd get added on Twitter and be like Shopify Rebellion stands by this behavior I'm and I'm like yes sir yes sir if you guys don't know okay uh Moi he feels really bad about this but I almost made a big mistake because he was playing a tournament set yeah and he was getting yelled at and people were going like yeah get those he's Canadian in the the tariffs get the tariffs ready you're about to be 51st state and they're just yelling at at them we're going to we're going to colonize your butthole yeah they're yell I don't think they it's more about it was rumored it was rumor so we should inade and terriff your butthole yeah okay part of the rumor we should it were you I was there I I said most of it so he's getting yelled at by people not playing with him and then after winning yeah he turns around and he's like dude [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you come on you piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kill yourself and before before he said kill yourself he said something pretty awesome too he said suck my fat [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and balls pause suck my fat [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and balls and he went yeah yeah it was pretty awesome and there's a video there's a video and and and and he he had a hot gamer moment yeah and look I like to hold it back I think it's too far personally okay do you do you you think it's too far you think it's too far yeah I would say that's inappropriate to say is that no I think most people would say it's too far I'm on the same page right oh how would most people I don't think you should be saying that to other people you should be saying that ever under no circumstances unless they said please can you say kill yourself so I can live for another 100 years it only this phrase unlock or if they said if you don't tell me to kill myself I'm going to actually do it that maybe those like Niche oneof problem ask you know personally against the whole thing yeah yeah you live and die by that live die by that but I got I got tagged and I I found out about all this because someone tweeted at lwig and then at at Shopify and they're like are you guys really having a player on your roster who does stuff like this and I saw it and I wanted to tweet at them kill yourself that would have been so oh my God that would have been unreal and and I'm drafting the tweet and I'm like uppercase K lower no that person had their leg like this over a rake it was it was all the way over a rake and Yingling of all people comes in yeah and I'm telling him about the I'm like you see the M thing he's like yeah Moi feels so bad and I'm like what he's like yeah talk to he feels literally so like cut up about it CU you know he didn't you know he acted like emotionally and irrationally and he just he didn't mean to say that like it's a real person he didn't mean it I was like yeah that's good that's good good Moi good aut them I don't like the writers of the Season having Nick Yingling come and deliver the news inal Beacon have a way around this that we're going to do some damage control we're going to make a new rule for melee okay every CRT is going to have a timer above it it doesn't start until the set is over and it's about like 8 seconds and until that timer hits zero you can say whatever you want you you can you can say anything this is a bad idea no this this would save Moi if it we had it at the time I think people this also save that one Ganondorf guy yeah it's he took way more than 8 seconds I I'll dial it to six but I trust me I want you to know does not does not change the example it's it's the end of the lobby at the end of a CSO game yeah exactly you you get all the anger out right there and then they go home and they like don't hit their I think in the The Purge but it's slurs yeah I I think instead you shout you shout into a box white men lining up for their N word path at The Purge Factory The Purge Factory to get the one yeah it would be around the block I think instead you shout into a box and then it just gets recorded and then you can listen back later and then you can listen to what you're like a box you can shout anything you want into this is just a confessional yeah this is also just like a recording device did the yard invent religion again yeah and we need a God probably mewo King yeah well of all the figures well dude I almost died on the way home from Genesis didn't shut up no you didn't you're such a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't know [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about this well okay first off mean right was mean to say are we just going to glaze over that what' he say he said you're such a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and remember what I said black out call me a freaking [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cuz well you haven't you haven't proven why you're not well I haven't proven why I am am I just default a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yes yes yes innocent okay well okay so this story is not going to help well okay so we were at dinner you look like you're right now you look like you're like an older brother and you're about to reveal that you also shaved your head cuz your little sister has cancer and then she's going to cry that's like the that's the vibe you guys my little sister's Aiden he doesn't have cancer he's just a cancer still balding when he sees you have the shaved head Aiden is just a balding woman it's still red uh we're at dinner us three slime's not there I wasn't there slime said no I need to please I I'm going to zipper I'm going to send you a photo I'm going to send you a photo [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] talking about oh is Zer still AFK [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] okay shake this is important context shake at the uh at Genesis goes to like the concessions line not known for amazing food at the Genesis theaters absolutely and he orders the meatballs I took a really funny picture of shake looking at the meatballs with his phone out at like jentis it looks so funny freak I'm excited to show you guys is it his thing to order the weirdest [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on the menu I got I got to find I got to go find the person who made the website and see if they're willing to add a second photo because I do think it his face just turns into that again he looks like he's sad about it um anyway uh for to hit the Tina kitten so I I go up to you guys after your block is over and I'm like do you guys want to eat and you were like no and you were like yes on the on the walk over to food this is less than 10 minutes after I asked slime slime messages shake and said where do you get those meatballs I want those meatballs so he was hungry he just said no to us no he had a flight to catch and so he didn't have time for dinner your flight it was like right it wasn't 10 minutes later cuz I was in the airport already I remember it I here here's what I saidit sorry that's even more embarrassing you were in the airport thinking about these meatballs I wasn't I just looked at his story cuz he okay this is what I said so you asked you asked him about the meatballs when you couldn't have them can't get the meatballs that is confusing you replied to their story how did you get this is what I said he said so they made this thing called fiat currency backed by gold but they Swit to Sil I'm being clowned right now but I know I'm in the right so I'm I'm relaxed because because it's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's an auditorium it's like a stadium right I'm like I have never maybe I'm uncultured I have never seen this option I thought I thought he like brought pasta I looked like pasta and meatballs like a bowl of spaghetti into the venue and it's while he's watching melee that's the that's what the picture was so my question wasn't those look good boss can I get some of that my goat how you get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] how did you re pasta and then he said concession stand yeah we are at Steakhouse if you're trying to and then I said no I'm at the airport I thought you brought in pasta that would have been a move that's how the conversation went that's you know what I'm saying so did your mouth water a little bit when you saw the picture no they looked gross I promise you I was my most normal day I even eat a meatball I was promised I was being normal and then I ate a whole bag of checks on the plane Finn so yeah we we did we did all go to dinner and I you went to the airport so question for you how far is the airport from the venue it's like 13 minutes it's close not even it's not even so you can get it there quicker too it's really close very close so close in fact that we were talking about how like oh man our flight's like in an hour and change like should I be nervous and I was like nah it's fine it's fine well it's you could bird there this is what he does bro he does this he said this in passing he said you could bird there did you bird freeway because I asked I asked if lwi like are you coming with us or like how are you getting there cuz me and Dan were heading to the airport and you I I and it was just a bump in the conversation you talking about a scoter put a bird on the freeway like five Genesis ago it was crazy I well I couldn't I did do that I couldn't go I couldn't go with them because I need to go back to my hotel to grab stuff and then when I was in my hotel I was just mapping it out and then next to the big car Option is the bicycle option and I clicked it and it turns out that there's a trail that goes directly from downtown San Jose to SJC uninterrupted it is all a bike trail all the way through and it takes like 25 minutes sure phenomenal okay and I'm like dude put some put some tunes in why why do this over the car because it sounds so delightful to be on a bird with a wind sweeping my hair I want I also want to clarify I the you might get to the airport like an hour before your flight normally sure he he had less than an hour already before before choosing the option choosing this option the longer option it was a time he had quite a bit I think he had like maybe 50 minutes at the point that we actually got 50 minutes before the flight took off okay which means you're boarding in 10 minutes and yeah yeah yeah and I was well it was little less cuz Southwest board's closer to to departure time but but I was basically like okay if I run the bird now I'll actually get there at 7:45 and I think it boarded at 7:45 yes so I was like that right for for eight the airport at that time like 740 I'll enter the airport and then I'll get through everything five and oh I've maximized I didn't have to spend 20 minutes in an airport so I win so I win and I and I enjoy the ride well the ride went not as I thought it would okay I'm a l YouTube video I can feel it so I got I got the bird I get the bird now and I and I start driving I get the bird then I get my bike you know hey yo okay and the bird's a a woman and we're Australian yes from the UK I help you continue yeah uh and and I'm using like my my airpods to guide me and it and it's like and it has me go down this park and I'm like and I'm thinking I'm so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sick cuz it's it's actually breathtaking is it it's a beautiful park at night it's lit up everywhere there's like people like skateboarding and gallivanting rich rich San Jose Boomer Tech [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah they might as well all be just beheaded sure but they're having a great time they're not yet all of them own a juicero and and and they're talking they drer to the park they drove that's how they got there I'm listening to orian dance and Max throttle okay uh and then the lights start to go away and I'm listening to my thing and it keeps making me there's like Forks on the road and left is like the actual Highway and right is deeper into the woods and every time it's telling me to go somewhere it's like and go right at the fork and go right at the fork and after three go rights I cannot see the road okay and I'm below the road too cuz it goes down and there's no lights except for the headlight of the bird is it paved it is it's like a bike path like literally a bike path that it's like those very narrow ones where it's like one's going this way the other one's supposed to go this way it's paved yeah it's paved yeah okay yeah it's like a nice paved bike path so I'm like yeah without lights without lights all right and so I'm and I'm and I'm burden does your bird have a light on the front my bird has a small light in the front so I can kind of see but I kind of have to lean down to get like maximum Vision cone of it so and then and and then I got like kind of jump scared cuz like I'm I'm birden and then there's no lights but then a cat pops in to view on the on the bird light I'm like the cat and then like another cat comes and there's like three cats and then and then I'm just like flanked by like tents there's just like okay Hess like every 15 ft is another 10 you found homeless World homeless world and for a mile straight it's just 10 I wish they ripped you limb from limb yeah you went to the back of the Snowpiercer train snarling snarling eat your bones start eating your hoodie off and I'm burning through and I'm taking more rights and and then it I I eat that $10 hot dog yours bro there's a small light in front of me and the light's getting bigger and I realize it's fire and on the bike path there's just a fire that some homeless people hello fellow bikers I too have gotten lost D dude they're just cooking atrio over over a spit and I would I would love to get some warmth around the camp you guys have provided me he's got an apple in his mouth I don't stop I'm short on time I swerve around the fire I swerve around atog yeah I take the Apple I take a bite naturally like like you're on your way to school in anime yeah uh and I have like maybe 15 minutes left uh for my ride but it tells me to go right one final time and I can't cuz it's flooded okay it is just filled with water this is like when SpongeBob and Patrick go to the bikini Rock Bottom very much like that cuz it's very dark I can't go right so I'm like I just go left that's simple and what I don't realize is left is private property okay and I didn't realize I thought it just a road cuz I saw a car I was like Civilization and then when I get closer to the car I see the like the house and the car light is on like they're in the car chilling and I get close and there's like nowhere to go and then they get out of the car and I'm like bad yep I shouldn't be on here what happened to me once I got a gun poting at me I don't even entertain the idea I just rip like right through some random Trail they have coward coward coward move uh uh could have disarm the the per but whatever I instead of disarming the per I go about 100 feet when I start to get like beep beep beep on my bird oh it's dying I'm outside of the bird Zone yeah I was I was thinking this happens the bird you go outside of like the AOE and it just disables it so you can't like ride it to you know Nevada certain areas you can't ride it one of those areas is the airport oh the whole airport is a bird free zone okay and and what happens is it it doesn't shut down but it goes to 3 miles an hour and just the location it shuts down if you try this if you guys want to live through my life is under a bridge and so it's pitch black and I'm just walking under this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Bridge did you leave the bird and no I'm using it to transport my Wares cuz I have the trash bag of my stuff why do you have a trash bag what's in the trash bag why you have a trash bag why you didn't explain that cuz that's just my stuff my bag like think of it like my you got on S Jose without it's strange that that is your bag you understand that how I travel right you have a trash bag with your stuff in it so he when L go somewhere he doesn't buy anything he doesn't carry a bag sorry he doesn't have anything he just gets on the plane with what he's wearing and if he needs shirts or whatever he just buys them at his location at dinner at dinner we were halfway through he was like Aiden you got any socks yeah he asked for socks at dinner asking for clothes cleck and I said I said I I whispered it cuz I actually was afraid he might get embarrassed I said love you're not wearing socks and he goes I'm not wearing socks and they go loudly like he corrects my whisper he goes I'm not embarrassed he goes I'm not wearing socks I'm not wearing underwear yeah and I'm like we're at a steak in the middle of a nice restaurant and then I I break the socks I pass the socks to him like I'm doing a drug deal I like give him just under the table you DB him up and there's socks in your hand well I had a 2day trip it was San Francisco day one San Jose Day 2 and I packed an undershirt with a T-shirt and I thought to myself day one I go t-shirt day two I go undershirt okay day one I go with underwear day two I go without underwear it's great it's why don't you just wear the underwear two days in F just take a backpack that's disgusting that's fine two days of underwear in a row there's this weird idea you have where rubbing your balls on the same piece of clothes for two days straight is bad that's nasty only if you take them off ye well no if he if you take them off and put him back on that is crazy but if you just don't don't take them off I take him off to shower and I put him back on out of the shower just for a Saturday Sunday cuz you're also going home that night so so what was in your trash bag my dirty underwear my dirty socks you didn't want to leave them behind my dirty t-shirt no I like them so you had a trash B that smelled like your balls but also had your stuff in it and had my well my only thing I brought on the trip was my steam deck you're and the one that you guys were playing earlier you're a millionaire you're a millionaire and you don't say mil without without making some concessions do you think a backpack is like gay to wear I think the airport people airport are gay you wear a f Mas why why do you hate a backpack so much I don't like the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] checkin security I don't like to put it in the top I don't like you don't have to you put it under your you don't have to do that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I didn't check are you TSA Pre yeah and you know how much faster TS PR is when all you do is go steam deck and then walk through it's sick the same exactly you don't have to anything out you have clear you have clear TSA Pre you're a millionaire if you were really about it lwig you wouldn't bring the steam deck because even stopping for the X-ray for steam deck or backpack same amount of time because you don't take anything out in TS unfortunately so if you were really about it just a gamer no items you ra dog unfortunately God has Afflicted me then you should have a backpack for your items was your steam deck in the ball sack bag yes but in its case so the case is dirty oh protecting it from the ball the deck is I was watching him play on it earlier there were no stains on it so I wipe it every time I play it for the ball sack okay so you're under a bridge you have your sack full of wees the bird is now going 3 m an hour you're late for your flight I am I'm now going to be late because I have to walk uh so I'm just walking the bird and it's scary I'm scared you're not scared I'm scared why would you be scared because I'm under a bridge and it's dark you have told me a 100 times you're not afraid to die where is that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I I'm scared of the doc maybe he's scared that he'll get hurt but not die I don't think he's scared of that I was lowkey I was lowkey a little I was lowkey a little creeped out I was a little sketched out you were afraid that a homeless man in a top hat was going to come chew your dick off yeah and screams at you bear in mind a mile before I saw them spit roast atrio so yeah I'm a little freaking barrels and they're just like it's like there's just two guys like with GI and here just roasted his eyes are popped yeah he's been dead for a while you could tell it wasn't pretty I'm also scared of missing my flight and then having to admit the reason I missed my flight yeah which is really bad yeah sure it is embarrassing and stupid uh so I walked the bird put your underwear through the x-ray they they thought it was radioactive yeah it for some reason the X-ray it has bones in it they had to give it to a German shepherd and he threw up and then he ate his own throw up they can't use him anymore kill the canine with your balls you broke the dog at can you have to pay for that and then and then I walked the bird shout out to whoever has to pick up birds I walk that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so far outside the Zone I walk that bird a clean I think it's going Decay straight into the ground I don't think anyone's going to go get that one that maybe and then I and then I had to cross like the five Lane Highway was fun yeah because all in all was the was the experience worth like now that you've seen all that and done all that and made that mistake would you say you don't regret it or would you say I should have just taken a car I would do it again you do it again if it was daytime yes night time I wouldn't okay daytime 1,000% I would recommend the ride okay I would recommend it well daytime you get there atrio still alive on Stick they don't SP roast in the day you could you could have saved it's night I mean it's hunt during the day cook during the night the day you just see a truck they gambling and you're like I wonder know where that's going to go he was talking about maong a lot this weekend that's so funny I get there I I got to the airport right on time I get there and they start boarding he yeah we yeah you're awesome boarding boing was in progress and lwig walks over and I see him and he's kind of he looks he looks disheveled he's kind of like brething Heavy He's and he's carrying his trash B so he doesn't he doesn't look good and you know you know when lwig walks in and it's like like how does he look so money it this is the exact opposite it's like lwig lwig looks like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he's got like motor oil on his face it's like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he's huffing the bag like pain like that's Jenum J I was like are you all right like you came it took you a while to get here he's like I took a took a scooter to get here I didn't believe him atever so you throw the trash bag away like before you go in the airport and you just held your items or like he has a trash bag at the gate he boarded the plane with the trash bag exactly to do it twice it doesn't make any sense he doesn't have to do it on the way and the only reason I had to do it this time is cuz I couldn't wear the shirt cuz it smelled like cigarettes dude yeah you smoked a bunch right yeah and nicking Nick yling a criminal ran into his own problem at the airport forgot we just got these uh a friend of ours came back from a trip he just went to like a like a Home Depot he thought it was air thought he's like he does thought the plan just left from everywhere no he [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up bad actually he [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up actually pretty bad yeah cuz you know how uh Ryan got us all the knives yeah he he had his he had his his what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you doing oh so he got taken from him dude so no but it's it's worse than that they like you know we can uh like you can get arrested and like fined for doing talk nice they go I cuz he has TSA Pre I think that was the big issue and when you have TSA Pre they oh it's like trying to sneak it through pre yes they check you less you don't have to like do as much work so when you abuse that you get punished and the way this guy was talking is like yeah you can get arrested for this you can you can be on a no fly list if you try to do this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and then the the what I think he's dealing with now is they take away your TSA Pre no yeah he bummed about that and then he he's confused because he's obviously made a mistake he had just forgotten it was in there and the he also is not sure how something is looking through the things he's wearing he like talk to Ray how did you know maybe we can sort all this out like first how did he look into the bag yeah this is some sort of is there a sorcerer that I can speak to let me speak to him it's just xray I just go on the website whoever you does the sorcery I he he told he told he he's like I he's mad and Confused apologetic but cuz he already got to Genesis with this in his bag and he's telling them that he's like that's awesome that's a really smart thing to isn't good but he's like what are you talking about I brought this on a plane I flew from here like they didn't stop me they didn't stop me with it then I I had several of these I gave them out that's surprising that he they didn't catch on the way here yeah I was which didn't give me a lot of faith in the whole process honest it's like very you don't it's like it's like one of those rare knives where you know it's a knife without even seeing the blade it's not like a lithium ion battery where it's like I didn't know it was in this like a Leatherman and there's no doubt it's not like oh it's a butter knife or a decorative one it's like it looks like it's it's made to kill people it was made it was made in the Philippines cuz I got one too it was made in the Philippines and it literally has oil on it like the oiled up knife cuz they hand make them so to be able to cut through quick yeah uh well Yingling you know what so Yingling's a terrorist he actually is the closest thing to a terrorist than any of us know flyless now which he thinks means he he will never fly uh he thought maybe one day thought when you turn 30 you're able to fly he Tak pretty hard hard man yeah he works hard bro we got to be careful man he works hard if he ever quits I'm done uh you'll just hire another Minion I couldn't no it'd be bad he's too powerful he's got a lot of you lose beo you never get another Minion like him again dude at Genesis so you know Lord farore yeah yeah so for those who don't know Lord farore is a notorious he's like a skull level 99 like a chat monster like he I see him in every chat dude he he's been he was in lck's chat since he had like a couple hundred viewers I think he's a degenerate he's a degenerate possibly multiple people well that's that's the thing so I'm at Genesis and for and I have a very frosty relationship I when I see him I I wish him death as do most this is not an uncommon feeling yeah and it's just normal and but I I I tweeted out about how like genesis is great because I was there and I was having a good time and then he replies to my tweet and he says uh I'm here it's time to do this or something like that he said I'm here let's meet and I'm like let's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] go I'm like I want to beat the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of this guy and he and I was like all right fine let let's meet up he's like after this Aura set or the the the melee player was playing on the big stage he's like after this set meet me by DDR I'm like okay I instantly go to DDR I don't even watch a set and um and I'm sitting there and I'm waiting for it to end and along comes another old head named Potato Sal and Saul sits down yeah he's like old bad melee head even like like this is is the Gathering of the old heads he sits down next to me he's like what's up I've seen him around and he's like what's up dude I saw your Tweet I've never seen him before either I want to see him too is it cool if I just sit here and I'm like yeah lights let's beat the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of the sky let's do this and I'm sitting down and we're just kind of talking and the AA set ends and now we're just waiting cuz he has never seen this person in real life I haven't most people haven't so now everyone walking by we're just kind of looking at them we're just like it's like a there's like a 40-year-old bald dude it's like is that F he like walks by us and he's kind of looking at us cuz we're obviously looking at him and we just like look down and then he keep going he like and it's like trying to find your blind data at the bar dude it was like a spy movie and I just realized like we don't know what he looks like he could send anyone Moi comes over and sits down and he's like so you've been waiting for me yeah like and it was and we're just sitting there and we're sitting there for way too long like the the melee sits are going on the big stage and then another one just goes by no one has come approached us no and I'm and I'm like I stand up and I say that you are one of the few people that can break that tension I well most people would just sit and wait and you you gra he was taking too long he said I'm going up after the aura set and he did it and me and and me and potato Sal are like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and we're just like theorizing cuz you have no way to message and I'm like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do we do bro and he's like I don't know man this is like he he's like I'm starting to get freaked out it's like I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] freaked out a horror movie yeah and so I'm like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this and I go fire more and I say I'm leaving show yourself and I walk away I go do something else I get a reply and it's a picture of me and soul so he just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sat there and watched you sat there he St us out he's a genius he's in your head he's a terrorist that's so cool so and I I go back I instantly go back to DDR he comes back too cuz we like split off po T's back he's like dude did you see that I'm like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] time and I'm so mad and it was like at a vantage say like I could pinpoint where he took the picture so like go to where it was it's empty chairs dude it's crazy you get it's like a little riddle yeah a note on the ground chair you'll never catch me a picture of me with my head blown apart and and I'm like God damn it I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hate this go somewhere where the farts are more the bathroom yeah he [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] got me and we're just standing there and we're just like we're literally about to like say goodbye again it's like I'll see you around man if you if you find anything like let me know cuz now we're on this case and um all of a sudden A Guy Walks up he's wearing a one piece Los Angeles Lakers jacket maybe you're familiar with this piece of clothing collab it's like it's a collab is it does it look cool lwig is an expert on both I don't think I don't think it looks cool ever pull it up I haven't seen this one piece Lakers collab jacket yeah that'll work yeah I'll also send uh I'll send it to zipper because I took a picture but this guy comes up okay and he just comes right up to me and I will never forget his face and he just leans in and he says I'm Lord farore and walks away me and bro are stunned uh yeah that's it that's exactly it me and bro are stunned and he just walks away and we start talking about like that could have been anyone like he could have just told somebody he he might not even be here he just told somebody to like go do this cuz the walking away it almost implies like well if you leave then then you don't have to answer questions you have you have no way to prove yeah yeah yeah I dude it and hold on let me send you the picture zipper and so I was like do we do we like chase this guy yeah you beat him with hamers do we like we chased him I I put it in the group chat think you just appreciate what you got and so yeah and part of it I was like I mean I don't want to like it's a beautiful mystery I I don't want to like grab him and then turn him around and it's just like a black circle you know it's a missing texture yeah and uh and so I just but I I I turned this along I'm like we're following him and so we just follow him and we just walk and we're just talking like do you think it's him like do you remember his voice cuz cuz there was people have seen farore cuz he was the guy who asked Armada at Genesis hey did you fart in that chair he asked him straight up uh which is a great moment in melee history so he's been around like he exists he's a human being and like you know we were like we were talking about like there's like a black guy that walked by like I don't think he's black like I just don't like like we were trying to like figure it out and we we were like it might be him it might be not and we just follow him and we're like keeping our distance do you have the video zipper this was him I just wanted proof he looks short that I saw this person he was like I think a little shorter than me um and then yeah okay I get oh yeah just and then he walks down in the bathroom and I say that's it that's the end of the road he went into the bathroom I don't know what he was doing in there I didn't following probably using the restroom and um and he's like I hear water running and that was it and then I went to the rest there's no one there bro potato Sal messages me later on and he said he took a picture in the bathroom I'll show you guys I'd like to actually protect his identity he said it was actually him wait potato Soul grabed this picture yeah he got a picture with him oh with him in the bathroom that's him that's him well if you want to protect his identity we have to we have to censor what the hoodie was cuz there's so many pictures of the event you probably find one I think that say someone does the work they do that much I'm not going to show his face but uh that's that's a a name to the face and that kind of ends well again it could be a random person it could be a red herring because I still think he's full multiple people it could be multiple people yeah it's the only thing that makes sense uh but yeah that was that was my the great farore mystery that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is terrorized so long beautiful um you're you're going to be look I think he's one of those he's one of those Chatters that you'd be sad if you left no oh sorry yeah by the hand of a different Samurai I would be sad if he left if he like died if he like got ripped apart by like a Factory machine like that swords hamburgers that be sad yeah it' be sad but if he didn't chat again I would probably be happy he's hurt both you so good yeah how does this happen look to be fair I would be happy because it means he's out there living a life he sent so many chat messages you have to understand the amount of twitch he watches exceeds the time of mod he's like someone who comes to your chat just to make chat worse yeah but he rides a line he never like crosses a line makes it like a bad chat he just exists and he's very precise at what he does he's like a he's like an asset to like a National Intelligence Agency i w I witnessed a pretty funny slime interaction uh this weekend I'd love to tell you guys about um so we were at Guild House which is like the bar after Genesis everyone goes to and a guy came up to slime and was like slime you maybe can correct exactly what he said but he said something along the lines of like slime you made me realize that I'm autistic oh God and what do you guys think slime said to that uh what would be what would be what would you say if someone said that to you will be on the test God help me H uh I don't care that you're autistic he goes he goes why would you say that to me he goes I'm not he goes I'm not like you I can be loud in public and then he starts yelling in public he starts going I yelled so loud I yelled so loud at a bar that people were like they looked everyone like and the girl behind like like the girl behind the bar the the the uh I can't think of the word the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the the bartender the bartender like it's just like it looks up she's like shocked she like scared by it and I I turn around too cuz slime is my friend is screaming I turn around and the guy I I like turn around as he's still yelling so I'm I get to see what happens as a reaction and the guy doesn't Flinch at all like like he I think he flinches maybe a little bit at the yelling but he doesn't like laugh or reciprocate or do he just kind of doesn't understand kind and I went well that guy's autistic yeah dude but there's two of them insane so he's insane he's insane in the in the story we just heard [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy person you know what he said specifically he came up to me he's like okay uh I know maybe this isn't something you want to here and I'm like starting to brace myself the the meter's already growing and I'm like yeah man and he's like I you know I I started when I watch podcast I started like thinking about like the way I get about like loud noises and the way I like and I was just angry all the time and I just I would be really angry and I would be be a dick to people and then I found out you know that I'm autistic and that was what it was and I I I was just mad that like oh my God I was like so you so so someone comes up to you and they're like they're like like you know they're writing to you like I found out I can't talk and you go and you go I can talk I'm talking right now yeah you're doing that yeah because I I I don't so so I so I I immed sound I immediately there's two things I wanted to do with you go to people Wheelchairs and jump up and down I wanted I wanted to test the theory I was like okay if freaks out let me stress test this and two I'm annoyed you want to see if he had stolen valor yeah hello ma'am may I shake your baby so okay so so you work at at like uh Goodwill and someone comes and they're like yeah I served I have PTSD you go okay let's find out and you shoot blanks in a gun and you clap and you go freak out freak out where's your PTSD yes because because I'm annoyed at the idea cuz already knew it was going to be annoying to me he could have just not done this so I was like you know what [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it let's give this a shot and so I go I'm not like you like Nick said I can be loud in public that's why my boy is all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up and he didn't from that it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up in general we were yelling at mango and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so I think it might be Stolen Valor CU he didn't do anything dude you weren't autistic enough when I screamed your face the guy did not know how to engage with it it was so funny I didn't think any would would Artic you laugh you laugh you say that's crazy this is a this is unbelievable how is it unbelievable dude I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] God damn it you're you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I think if he yelled back that'd be tight there'd be some like some other some people listening would be like oh guys there's a couple autistic guys here that be fine they're screaming in a bar starts yelling back at me I just shake his hand I go well played you know the whole weekend I had pretty positive fan interactions but there was one where me and Anthony were sitting down and playing together and the guy came up to us and he started the conversation by saying you know what do I need to do to get on the yard and I can I I look at immediately look at Anthony even though I'm in the middle of a game of melee against someone else Saucy M the Luigi m is to my right and I I see the like steam already building and I I have never been in this spot before where I'm there with witnessing an interaction that I know is going to go horrifically bad he's never been there before I've I actually have not been there I've been in this like I step in with the bomb diffusal kit and like cut Anthony off and I'm doing like everything I can to engage this guy in like a normal conversation and every time he has the option to pick the good conversation path he goes left op and I realized what Aiden was doing so over 30 I heard I he was and I let I let Aiden Drive I just thought it was really funny your credit you're receptive if I jump in to diffuse you'll accept it yeah he did that he did that cuz I knew it's like I I need to do this for the good of the five people sitting here I need to J I'm I'm not trying to show out like I'm not I don't and then this conversation like the the end the end point we're at keep in mind he's picked the bad option the whole way down which give an example of bad option well one of the times he was like he said something about like I how do I get get on the yard and I'm like I said something I think you got to have bigger goals or something like that like you know I was playing around with it but then he said something like I just want to like be your guys' friends and I instantly look I look at Aiden I just put my arm around him and I just start patting his head and I just say I just say he you're he's going to talk to you now I said he's going to talk we're slowly the end result of this conversation is I'm I'm saying cuz the guy is like everybody in this interaction is obviously well meeting and I'm like yeah we could just sit down and like play some melee like you could just come up like anybody else would and we could just like play some melee together and I mentioned this a couple times and then we we've been locked in this conversational Loop for maybe a few minutes to be fair Aiden also was like but I will say you have changed the dynamic to this guy you have changed the dynamic Aiden was Aiden was not letting him down easy he was he was making sure he knew like he does with his girlfriend that he has done something wrong yes the end result was I was like it would be you know like any other person I meet at a melee tournament I'm down to like play melee and and chat you know and I'm offering that to do later in the day or or whenever would be possible and then he's like you know I'm just not very good at melee I don't know I don't play very much anymore and then and then Saucy man and Abel who have been listening to the conversation the entire time but like awkwardly sashy man cuts me off and says dude just say yes just play melee with him just say you can just play melee with him saying Mele burst out laughing cuz I it's so funny that like of the third party has to jump in for me slime is even holding back I said the least out of all this be your friend I don't want to play melee I'd rather just hang on I said the least out of all this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I promise just go in the Arie don't do the whole Mele and I saw the guy like later later again that that uh you know that night and you know he was nice and I and I said hi and I think like I said everybody in that interaction is well meaning but it was so funny to go down like the chain of command in the interaction like trying to diffuse the conversational bomb yeah what I've realized is like Nick's the chaotic evil one wait what I feel like if you see slime in that spot you let him burst oh yeah where you around for while sometimes you like you like crazy let let me tell you exactly my thought Tre there's part of that that maybe is true but hold on and then there's a third option where like sometimes he'll like he'll deflect and he'll exit right but the third option is is Nick will set up like the jigsaw trap for them and he'll like like Anthony explodes and like has his has his loud yell to the room interaction but Nick will will set up a game well well I think Aiden I have a new thing I do which I think Aiden has witnessed a couple times uh where when someone comes up it if they say something to me first I never choose this path but if they say something to slime like directly first I know that that conversation is eventually going to also come to me like when we're together sometimes they'll be line to him and they'll be like slime can I and I'm like okay well I'm in the waiting room now for this guy but if they say something cringe to him I I do this thing now where I go o i out loud I go o and and then I and then I walk away before they can get to me dud actually that actually so much more and it's only if they really it's like the guys really that's like what a Haw girl in high school rehearses I go I go o cuz it's just so bad and I'm like well I'm not going to talk to you you know what I've been I've been starting to think about something it's cuz cuz I think I have the least amount of these interactions and at first at first I thought this was because I think in general my my reaction to most versions of people coming up to meet me is just positive I do whatever I can to make this interaction positive for the other person even even if they say something awkward and for a long time I thought we must be getting the same sample size of people but then like and then I'm like diffusing the conversation craft it's your tools but I think at this point it's been enough years of seeing other people approach slime and Nick first and I think slime genuinely attracts a different type of like yes like he he he actually gets way more of like insane interaction you know what is about him I think people who come up to him are gamifying meeting him like they want to be one of the ones that win the inter want to thread the needle yeah they want to be like this guy normally doesn't like people or at least the way and I think the pressure is more on when you meet them so you feel you like anyone who thinks about it that way is obviously going to faux paw socially cuz they're thinking about social interactions like games to it's just a harder character to Main yeah well there are people who are very normal again most people I know the it's fun to talk about the people that are cringe again disclaimer most people are normal and it's great and the tournaments are awesome but but a lot of times people will come up and they'll be totally normal and then they'll finish the interaction and I'll be like all right have a good woman man nice to meet you and then it' be like I was really nervous by the way and I'd be like I couldn't tell and so it's like they they just they just passed you know their own little test but they also wanted to make sure I knew U maybe because they were too they thought they were coming off weird or something and I guess someone who fails the interaction doesn't end by going I was really nervous by the way because it was a parent yeah yeah they don't need to follow up by saying that dude there was uh I was talking I was sitting talking to Mojo and con not con Cony 20xx com Fox Brandon YouTube shorts Andy YouTube shorts Brandon com Fox Cony 20xx I was sitting talking to this guys for like an hour and we're just catching up and throughout the whole time people just keep coming up right and these guy I've known these guys for [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] years now and they're they're used to it or whatever um but every time Brandon was talking to me he was talking about his life and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and they would come up and interrupt and I don't really love that because it's like I'm he's talking to me you're not interrupting me you're interrupting my friend and uh so I'd say for one I'd be like he's talking and then they'd be like they'd cower yeah and they'd be like oh my God I'm so sorry I'm so sorry and like it's okay do you want a picture and they'd say yes and then I say Brandon has to be in it yeah so so there's like five people with me con and them and con's just doing like this every time Mike really likes being the one to say oh I'll take it for you guys cuz Mike always takes a selfie first classic yeah yeah Mike's Mike's got a lot of selfies on a lot pictures of Mike and our people's phones too um someone gave us dice that was I think the Highlight uh this girl came up yeah they she made D and D dice for all of us it's in my bag I'll bring it but yeah I was like we will be using these I bought so many new dice really on the Tik Tok shop yeah someone gave me and you specifically me and you like a big ass gift like a like a like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a kids birthday party bag gift and and I was playing Friendlies with Magi when I got it and then and then she walks away she was sweet she walks away and Magi looks at me as like now what like now you have that big bag now work and I I'm like yeah I don't know I guess I'll [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] by the way I guess I'll take it home I have Aiden I'm like like everyone's so nice but I don't want a big bag No I have the heart to tell her bro I was like this is a lot of stuff PS5 well yeah I took the PS5 I left you the rest I left you like the the manuals the game manual Nick cut the uh the the $100 bill out of the card and you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bro you get those soap bars when you're younger that have money in it yeah what money yeah that a dollar or whatever in it it would have an amount of money could be up to 100 is it supposed to like encourage your kid to wash their hands or something and so make money yeah I guess I think it was like to encourage soap usage yeah and then at the end you have a fun surprise the uh the guy one of the guys that came up to me he was the guy who beat me last year in pools and uh he was a funny guy last year but he comes up and he's like hey dude do you remember me and I'm like kind of looking at him and he's like we played last year in pools I'm like how could I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] forget cuz you know like threw and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and he was very funny and he was wearing the same outfit he made sure he it was like a green pla it wasn't like a special outfit he was like he was clearly wearing the same thing and uh and he was like uh I want a money match you and it's like oh I was like have you been playing all year he's like yeah and I was like well I haven't so I'm going to turn that down and instead I am just going to call you master from now on and so now I I or I call him chef and so so every time I saw him I was like yes chef hello Chef so that that was me uh slinking away from from a money match I think cool he was really funny there was this uh younger guy who came up to me and he said hey I went to high school with your used to that yes sir yeah yes sir you said I know why us say diesel D up too many people are becoming friends with diesel Derek after this weekend dud dude we were at the bar and and literally a random guy like must be a listener of the show someone was just like diesel Derek isn't he 19 and Aid Aiden screams in the bar he's not 19 dude he looks like Clark Ken it's bad he's like an adult man we've gone into the we we're in Gil house we all showed our IDs to get in we're in the middle of a crew battle I'm on diesel D drink you could go and then and then the whole the whole of the YB boys who I'm playing with are talking about loudly Yelling to the other team about how young Derek is and I was and I I look at the other team and I'm like he's 29 years old and the bit the bit has escaped even the yard going too far shake and Yingling hung out with him all a. it took so long cuz they kept to go one person in the bar and then two out with the ID to get diesel anyway different guy who looks he looks like he's like college age and he comes up to me and he says uh he's friends with Ethan my little brother and then he went to high school and then he like lived in our town in Washington which is all wild he's roommates with Graves now yeah and he that's awesome and he's like do you think after that loss Graves had to really move to a tough neighborhood he had to move to the booties yeah yeah he's stuck in the booties though rode by him on the bike Graves was SP roting Atri got e do you think some would money match Graves and I was like no I wouldn't let him as his representative I wouldn't let him I was like I was like first of all no but second it would it would take all the joy cuz there's just yard on top there's just no chance there's there's no chance anymore and it was a beautiful thing it was already unlikely at the time I think that's cowardly I would money match you H you money match me yeah how much you want to play for when would you want to play when yeah I don't know we can play right after this I'm busy busy busy right

he could beat you at dinner yeah crazy and then and then he backed it well to be fair I said I could beat him star I think he could I think he would treat Pokey man wonderfully by the way I think they would have an excellent day honest Pokey would be so lucky poke be so to go on a DAT with Shake drizzle I know poke history we're talking about like it's a joke I think they'd be amazing together I know pok's dating history none match to shake and and zipper I did send you a picture uh poke man if you're watching this I I know you do watch the Pod Just Close Your Eyes for a little bit we're

was like I cannot keep playing my hands hurt way too much I can't play dude I'm sorry and he just looks at me he's like really and I'm like yeah and then and then he went his he ate his shame meatballs yeah picture I won and DED him with a jv4 and the whole weekend he just kept talking about it to people but he told it to Nick he was like guess what this guy JB fors me and then just walks away on the setup and then Nick was like why did you tell me that yeah no you were he was like this guy's like my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hands hurt and he plays and he JV fors me and then he just gets up and I thought about it for like a second and I'm like his hands hurt and he jv4 me and Shake's like why is that all you heard from that and I'm like I mean why'd you admit it yeah he Nick said that's the loudest part of the loudest part of what you said yeah that's he was saying with a little too much pride a little too much chess like can you believe this guy you believe this guy destroy me really badly well he went one two today j4 and two I lost two terrible players and I'm that much worse that's tough I got nervous a man who never enters never loses uh you're right but I'd rather have lost I'd rather have entered and lost lost Lear lost it all classic goddamn right uh yeah all three of you entered all three of you kind of did [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] no he I played Jigglypuff oh right you couldn't Nick [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he took some souls and then he had to play a puff Karma got me I was in bracket and there was a lot of people who were like like aren't you a Falco and I'm like yes Jigglypuff time to play sorry sir uh and then and then yeah and they would be they would just like visibly be like and I'm just like there was a kid there was like this young kid who played like a great Falco he was like we were all looking like this kid's this kid plays great yeah I F like my dream and all my time playing puff was like I just want to play a Falco in a part of tournament that matters and I want to see what happens I'm so strong at that match up I finally got a Falco one before my match to make it out and he was very solid and he was super aggressive and he played so cool um and he lost and he lost he lost puff I was like jiggly puff I remember just being like I I hit the big kid on him yeah dude I rested under his laser and I rested him when he landed and Zay was like what or Zay a pangu and I was like that's the big kid and then you you stood up you like did you see the big kid and I was like I told him and this poor [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kid he had to be like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 20 at most he was just like like you I hope he keeps playing and I I I was I was kind of feeling the that was the worst part was beating a cool Falco cuz I I I literally told him after I'm like I do I'm like you know I know it's a little annoying but I I like how you play that match up it's really cool like you're really aggressive and he was like he punched me uh no he was like thanks man uh but then my RAID boss at the end of my pool this guy comes up and he's smiling and he's just like he's like you play me now I play puff too and I'm like oh God the only character I don't want to play against I'd rather play Luigi uh and we walk over and I I don't even know how long it was I sat looking at the character let screen for like minutes I'm like I don't want to do this right now I know I'm going to lose like I also just like don't want to play the matchup and he's like smiling he's like this he's like what are you going to do what are you going to do and uh and then I played puff and then I was like okay I'll play Puff but we have to go no Dreamland the entire set and he's like deal we can go Yoshi's every game and I was like my man [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and then uh he won and that's Karma that is karma to get out the only thing I got is one of the my first like harder match in my pool that I didn't get to go to I played him on ranked right before this and I W I wanted to beat him so bad to just like to just like mentally prove a point to myself it it did go good dude okay I got to I going to say some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] when I come into this office and he's got his headphones on playing melee I feel like dad's about to get home and I had bad grades for the semester scar I want to be D [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I I do think Aiden is a scarier man playing melee than like being a stranger would be interacting with you I think so I'd rather run through a 100 interactions with slime as a stranger I was locked in because if you guys like you see this sweet Aiden maybe you've met they think he's so sweet you saw closed doors with control in his hands oh my god with a belt in his hands to that's what it feels like it feels like it's the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] time what are you looking at and it's not like Moi moi's different cuz he's mad at he's mad at the game he's mad at the randomness but melee is mad at the world dude he like he only speaks through his teeth when he's done playing melee the things that Moi said is like come on might as well be talking about buying them flowers am to like what what his whole speech was it what what his tie raids are yeah it's scary well said lwi but you got so much better low key give you that I beat Dy today you beat I've lost to daie for do you know how long I've been losing to Dy I've losing to for almost a decade I I went 10 years without hearing that name till today uh well that's I mean that's sad cuz duy for who for him that means you didn't pay attention to what to m pay attention that means you did pay ATT hung box one and then he beat himself Beast that picture is so good I knew when I saw on the screen I'm like that will be awesome online later he was so wet you know what sucks I called him winning early you you've called him winning like the last three you bet on him winning when one of your players was still in the tournament yeah fck I was so happy I didn't take that bet to you I made a bet to Aiden before the tournament started I said 5 to one hungry box wins cocaine w and he said ,000 so I'd have to pay I'd have to pay huge you would have to pay me a th000 bucks and I would have to pay 200 if I lost and I knew I wouldn't cuz I knew he would win cuz I can I didn't take it I was too scared I was like and losers is looking scary what sucks is I knew Juan would win and I still lost $600 because I bet on him in winners and he didn't win through there mango did the thing where uh he he Busters out and then doesn't stay for the picture of top eight after which he does every time he loses to Genesis and uh when we when I was they took the picture and we all we all leave to go to dinner and leave the venue I see mango out front of the venue he's just there and he just didn't go inside for the picture and I'm like Hey we're going to dinner you want to go to dinner he goes they take the picture in there and I'm like yeah and he's like so boack made me walk here for nothing what and I'm like what I'm like I'm I'm just inviting you to dinner I don't care about any of this and he's like he's pissed that he boback made him walk back to the venue to take the picture and then they took it anyway they took it anyway but he was late that's like he was clearly just got here way after it was taken like 10 minutes after it was taken dude he was still there you know how much longer cuz I had to I like had a line of people and then I was waiting to exit yeah and I go through the line he's still there like 20 minutes after in the same spot I presume but now smoking a cigarette that's awesome that I think he smoke a lot of cigarettes spawned for him and then the video of him's crazy it was a great video that's the there's a video of mango it's just him being pushed away by a security guard trying to Juke out the security guard like saquan Barkley failing and then like swinging his shirt and then it just shows an incredulous hungry box but look at him yeah look at him try to guy is just standing there he's clearly trying to fight hungry box he's swinging at him right yeah he's definitely trying to fight hungry box his security guard does not understand the context and they got their fight I ended up seeing pictures of them on the ground oh yeah yeah shout out to US Marine on the left I'm sure the entire night he went let me fight you hunger bucks no Meo I can't fight I I'm taking the wife fight I already beat myself and I want to do it again super wet on on stage for everyone wonda forever yeah wonda forever wonda I've always said no I don't like how

imagine when you combine two it's like one you keep the shape of one and the flavor of another kind of mixure Plum as opposed to magical new real thing yeah it's a plum and an apricot but I'm saying

size and the shade of the pumpkin but the flavor of a blueberry that's a combination it's but you it this is the spirit of the question you're being Tech when interracial couples have babies it looks more like one parent than the other how is this different yeah but you don't get to interracial couples have babies yes Nick why would you even think that they shouldn't but they do okay too far I'm intercial what you wereing that you shouldn't I thought it was kind of your funny joke about that's actually dude there was this the photo of Serena Williams and her husband who's like one of the co-founders of Reddit was going around know that some it's dude there was some strong anti- interracial marriage sentiment going on in that one people hate interracial marriage when an ugly white guy gets a come up all of a sudden interracial marriage is bad because a guy looks like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] when he's shirtless yeah he does look bad he doesn't look great in the photo he looks bad in the photo I'm he's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he's not he's not beating anyone up for her and she's taller than him yeah she's accomplished and world famous yeah I I did like sus there was a lot of replies that were like that were like she's only she's is only D they're only married for his money I was like bro I don't think I think Serena Williams might be the bread winner in that relationship think she's fine I think she's doing fine she's doing totally fine she Dan with DOT bro is bil set up for life she danced with DOT he's a 6'5 billionaire is what I learned he's 65 yeah he's actually 6 God he made Reddit the front page of the internet he's 6'5 he's one of the people that's something Alex would say you know I'm reading the front page intern fun page this morning I thought rdit was also like Aaron Schwarz yeah yeah there a few co-founders yeah um you know what I've been doing recently is drafting tweets and deleting him and it's been so great it's a good it's actually a huge guys like me I draft tweets and I don't delete them I just text them to Alex cuz I realize it's all I want is a friend to laugh I don't actually need to tweet anymore I'm not tweeting funny [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] though I'm tweeting like like there's this really tweeting kill yourself at strangers well that one I don't delete that I screenshot but there was like this poke main tweet that was like there's no female streamers that are as big as like higher speed and then someone quot retweeted was like yeah because they all do only fans and that if if they didn't do only fans maybe they get some freaking views yeah like a 100,000 likes I was like there's so much wrong with this but they're just never going to be a successful streamer and I went through it all I was like why am I telling them this doesn't matter them that me telling this information even though I know so much more about streaming they ever will till they die you just it's just so if you gave them the knowledge they wouldn't know how to think about it it's just Shadows on the cave wall to them it's what they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] know you don't get you don't get like this often I like when you get like this it's like this is how I get and this is how he gets yeah it like three times where I kept reading really dumb [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that I was knowledgeable about but I I I was like I shouldn't there's no point well I mean you feel compelled to do it because you're trying to write a wrong you see with the knowledge and the skills you have that's That's the basis of it but then you abandon ship also if Mr Beast hung his hot dog on only fans he'd be bigger than ever what I don't think that's actually true I don't think that's if he put his penis on only face I don't think if he shows me yeah he he Mr if Mr B start you know um Mr Beast is a transactional relationship Mr he loses so much money if he does Mr Beast is is is more of a a Creator where you see his penis for money you don't like you know what I'm saying be represents gambling and chance to to to change your life yeah that's not what only fans is for you know what I'm saying nope no going to be honest I listen whole thing I have no idea what you mean only thank you zipper zipper said I do only fans is about fostering a sexual parasocial relationship with your viewer yeah I think Mr I think when Mr Beast went in the pyramids I think that's what he was doing I don't think M I think he was trying to foster a sexual parasocial relationship with a Pharaoh's ghost yeah with like a kid in India India yeah like his viewers like 80% right a TV I'm like I'm like yeah I'm not following either of you I think no no I'm sorry this is PL and Socrates you're one of the guys again again shadow on the wall you're in the cave right now and I'm just going I know the Mr Beast guy I'm not even I'm on the streets outside the building I'm like I'm with the vendors so okay well fine I guess I'll concede but I still think it'd be it'd break the internet can we agree on that did you finish Beast games would break the I did finish Beast games they're kind of crazy it was kind of a lame ending well like just the actual Ending game or like the ending episode the ending game and also just kind of the way it played out sure that's fair I think on paper it's cool like on paper you go that would be so dope if it happened that way but then you watch it and you're like oh it was quick Beast games what is this Genesis is a v Beast no that is a stret that was horrendous that was a stretch that was a stretch dude today I I had uh uh elon's worried about x.com he us a com B with his ex and I didn't post that so if I didn't post that you don't get to say that that's pretty good it was more of a stretch I like that was pretty good oh dig man you know this crazy old [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up world full of piss and porn sour movies all sorts of junk you guys are my best friends yeah yeah you ever think that about me yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I think that about you do you yeah yeah you say it quieter than the rest of them I said it pretty quiet mm that's cool I've had a before you guys had a episode without me I had Co and uh I'm having a weird uh uh postco symptom where throat's still weak uh throat is weak I learn I heard you guys talk about that okay let maybe keep both true got weak throat is there is there a way to strengthen it am I born with that it so has having to ask that question kind of locks you out how do you get a bigger penis it's like what do you adding is the average based on soft or hard cuz um uh so I have this weird postco symptom where everything including air smells like rotting food and also like chemicals like ammonia that's a symptom yeah it's like it's called like I can't it's called starts of the P but every it started yesterday and I thought there was something rotting in my hotel room e and I was searching around I'm like what is that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] smell so I just left the hotel and it just the smell followed and I was just like what and I'm like wearing I'm wearing normal clothes I'm wearing new clothes this is also like that SpongeBob episode yeah that Ros Mia W and and I was like what is this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] smell and if you like look up like how it's described it described exactly what I'm smelling like rotten food garbage uh and it hasn't left I just it's like making my day worse like I I woke up this morning and I was just with Shake all day I was just like oh I don't even want to I want to like mouth breathe CU every time I go like this like just smells like disgusting dude I did not know about this it really I've had Cod before a few years ago the hot symptom was you lost taste and smell and now it's kind of it's giving you yeah and I have like a like a subdued taste and smell right now but now that my smell is like starting to come back it's only smells bad like everything smells bad which like the way they describe it is like it's like your nose forgets how to smell and you have to like retrain it you have to retrain yeah that's what I was going to say is I remember hearing about that back in the day like people do retraining courses they have a bunch of jars of scents and they have to like one of them's just a butt yeah one of them's a big butt ass and you got to smell that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's the doctor's ass face up the doctor goes and then for the final smell and this one's butt and he pulls that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out no no he doesn't say that it smell good he says what's this you ever watch that European show it's pitch black and they smell and they have to guess what it is and one of them's a butt and they put their nose in the butt and they smell and they goes that smells like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] just and then it goes Ding and it's correct and he's like oh no I think we have watched this thing I feel like we'd make up on this show you know I think I'd be able to know it's butt I think if it was my to be clear yeah of course you would [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] be able to tell no I don't think you could tell I thinkful French dish sometimes butt smells nice you have some nice butt you fresh out the shower little butt pause smell of the cuz why are you also known as durun durle height yeah that is not a real language bro can you look at video of buttell smelly ass Danish game show yep now click that click funny media Online Reddit that one just says total any of these to blackout is that the show Total Blackout uh I guess this maybe like an American version name of it it says Danish game show in total dudee I'm excited oh

it he just whiffing that guy he is up in that getting too involved my God I think he likes it low key oh he found out so long [Music] ago it is dude I thought he was going to go back in I thought he was going to go back in he's like grossed out have I really been smelling a stinking ass oh my God but hope wait this is the most awesome show ever ever what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I think I would love to watch a whole show of people smelling butt that's so that guy looks like a DOTA player so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] funny that clip rules that's cool a smelly ass correct you know what [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up we could do a yard Booth like that and we'd have people play it isn't that gross isn't so gross we should do uh we do like an event and we have like a booth where you walk in and you either get you either meet zipper or you smell one of our butts and zipper's just not there and the zipper chance is like 0. Z yeah he does like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Hollow it's a hollow knife like you were cracking like something rare but the you mostly are going toell it's like one in600 and it's just our butts you don't know whose butt is who zipper goes I'm down I think it'd be an easy game to be honest I don't think I want people don't know if there's winners and losers yeah there's in my butt for Z actually winners probably one if any random is so disgusting dude shut the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up why cuz why you why are you mad about the truth you always freak out about the truth you're just saying you buil you built your Empire on the bones of people that want to smell your butt and you're okay with that you ever think about I'm the only guy that's not okay with it yeah and you're still living off of it so but I tell them no doesn't matter your actions are way louder than your words my actions are not letting them smell my but okay another hypothetical do you think sler bad yes that's a weird amount of time SP I wanted to make sure okay either way you can be like slavery is bad but if you're a slave owner and you're like slavery is bad I'm not a SL owner I know but that doesn't make you better than other slave owners you're just as bad no it doesn't the awareness of what you are doing being bad better huh you're marginally better you're a little bit you're 0% better what 0% 0% better well how do you own why do you own them what's the circumstances in context huh I need context how do you own the slaves you you to handed down did you grow them like I don't they were they you 3D printed you bought them I guess I don't know how to he hates what is this Leviticus I don't I'm not to tell you to buy a slave you just have slaves okay asking questions this the Bible the analogy blaming the Bible yeah I I'm just this a hypothetical and I'm saying self-awareness of this problem that you are participating in to make you there's a difference between dream and there's a difference between chap orone I don't think he was a genie is's not being hypocritical because he's not letting the fans sniff his ass listen no he's hypocritical cuz he is making money off of the bones of people who would sniff his ass in a room if it were up to me I would behead all of those people and I would leave the people alive who do not want to stiff my ass in a room I think that's the majority well but I'm the only one saying this I'm the only one saying this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you will never say that makes that makes you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up you will never say that you will never say I wish you were beheaded for being weird but I will say it that wouldn't make me a good person I slightly worse I don't think lwig wants them to sniff his ass I don't want them to sniff my ass and I don't want to behe say but I don't want to behead them not going to sniff no not no well don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] chime in on him you do this thing and I don't like it what a question you chime in and and and I wouldn't even do a sniff cuz you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] living it and it seems like you hate it so yeah I'm sniffing God's ass the world's ass all day the ass of the world so so anyway don't make you freaking better said you want to behead 1% how much do you think that you could charge for a sniff of your ass how much could I charge I don't know that would get paid yeah I think it's not like like I'm going to like it's a bidding like a charity bidding and it's like what would it go for no there's some gay guy out there that would pass why have to be gay I because I don't think women have an appetite for that particular IE from oh my God call me crazy disagreeing I think they are way more willing to sniff that ass oh classic gay sex is just smelling someone there's a horniness let's run a little experiment what let's run a little experiment let's just hypothetical to engage in we do the we do the lottery to sniff Taylor Swift's ass every Taylor every Taylor Swift fandom person is entered in this Lottery and you randomly pick one is it more likely to be a man or a woman who sniffs her ass okay what we have need to say who's a fan well I would say first off a lottery is a much better idea than an auction because I think people would enter it just for the chance I don't even think they might want they might not want to do it but they just like would we have like assume for the lottery that they the person knows they have to do it if they win and they're they're gone through a rigorous process where they convinced in general more online fandom is fueled by women that's true a loty is different though and I think it's probably women it's a different it's a different fun an auction apples and oranges combined are is the are the cheeks spread no why is that a bad question you want that no right they they're not you smell so you're smelling the cheeks not the but hole look I don't want to get into the weeds of this cuz I'm against it to begin with cuz I had to say it for you to say it okay what do you want to talk what do you want to talk about you want to talk about twitchcon what you talk about twitchcon what do you want to talk about PR week don't act two options is some corny [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] was it one out of 10 this week don't act like the options are some corny [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] how much would it cost to sniff your ass well lwig doesn't want to talk about butts so we're going to stop the podcast podcast is Over Now podcast is over said it's over to hear us talk about the inside of a of a spread Chic maybe from a celebrity that you like uh
