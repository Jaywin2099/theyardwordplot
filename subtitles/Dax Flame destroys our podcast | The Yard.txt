 Lwig. Dude, I can't believe I sent that text to Mr. Beast. &gt;&gt; I went too far that time telling you what to text. &gt;&gt; What's up, bro? What's up, bro? &gt;&gt; What's up? You want some of this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; You know what that guy just said? &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; He just said of all the Y members, he'd kill you. &gt;&gt; He didn't even say that. Let me see. &gt;&gt; What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you doing? &gt;&gt; E, &gt;&gt; we're hot. &gt;&gt; We are hot. We're hot. We are. We are. &gt;&gt; Says we're hot. &gt;&gt; As if we're in some sort of flame. M &gt;&gt; as if we're we're uh we're dax we're daxing in some flame. Is that work? &gt;&gt; Phantom Dax. &gt;&gt; Phantom Dax. Wow. &gt;&gt; What are you guys talking about? &gt;&gt; We have to get out all of the niche very modern streaming references now in case he doesn't get them. &gt;&gt; Okay. Um &gt;&gt; cuz we have a very [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up life where no one understands. &gt;&gt; I can't believe uh I can't believe that Jason um killed his girlfriend. We're gonna have a 45 segment where I explain Jakura to our next guest and the future replacement of Aiden on this podcast forever. &gt;&gt; Dax. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Wow. He stopped halfway down. It's okay. &gt;&gt; We got to grease the slide. &gt;&gt; We got to Yeah, we got to oil up the slide. &gt;&gt; We just have water perpetually going down. Is that a problem? If we covered you in oil, would that be a problem for you, Dax? &gt;&gt; Um, like for the for the slide? &gt;&gt; Yeah, for the slide. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I don't think I would want to do that. &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah, fair enough. &gt;&gt; Fine. &gt;&gt; Fine. All right. &gt;&gt; God, I love seeing you in that chair specifically cuz you don't you haven't met him, but we have a friend named Aiden who usually sits in that chair and it would just be so much better if it was you. &gt;&gt; You're doing such a better job already. I I I would like to um Yeah, I would love to be a part of the show &gt;&gt; permanently. I guess &gt;&gt; you're hired. You're here the thing. &gt;&gt; What's his reputation? Oh, so well he if he was there right now, he'd probably be on his phone. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; he'd be on we we would have started the show kind of like we're hosts of it a little bit and he almost like he's a guest on the show would be on his phone not participating but you immediately boom. &gt;&gt; If I were to give you tasting notes of Aiden, I would say emotionally mature, &gt;&gt; uh, intelligent young uh almost like a hard worker. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then bad at Counterstrike. That's the base note. That's the That's the foundation of everything that makes him him. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Are you How good are you at Counterstrike? &gt;&gt; Uh, bad also. &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, welcome to show. &gt;&gt; I haven't played it, so I don't know. &gt;&gt; That's about the same. &gt;&gt; Well, on top potential then. You could be better than Aiden. &gt;&gt; Could be. Can I Can I ask you a question? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Cuz I just want to rewind. Why Why are you here today? Oh, well, because I met you at the store and then um and then so then I I messaged you, I think, right? And then um and then people had uh people had asked me to come on here before, but then uh the first time I'd heard about y'all uh was someone said that I took one of y'all's idea about parking meters, &gt;&gt; but I hadn't I didn't know that before. I didn't know that before. Ask a Have you made anywhere upwards of like a million dollars from that idea? &gt;&gt; Uh, I haven't made any money off of the idea. It was just something I did to save other people money. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it was a selfless thing that lost money maybe. &gt;&gt; Um, yeah, just like $5 maybe. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you probably approached it wrong. You sure you stole the exact idea from me? &gt;&gt; Um, I don't know what your idea specifically was. What it was what I did was just pay a few people's meters that had run out so that they wouldn't get parking tickets &gt;&gt; cuz LA parking is is really expensive. I I'll catch up to speed from on just that one and we can go back. He once said, "I have an I have a million dollar idea for you. We can make parking free in LA &gt;&gt; and &gt;&gt; for a day." &gt;&gt; For a day. &gt;&gt; Imagine &gt;&gt; like a Mr. Beastesque I made parking free in LA for a whole day and my I have porcelain teeth. &gt;&gt; I I didn't think that idea was good because I didn't understand how to make money. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, were your was your idea to make money off of it? &gt;&gt; About a million dollars. Yeah. I thought I thought they would generate so much hype and potentially love in the hearts of citizens across all of Los Angeles in a in a time where we need it most and that that would somehow convert into money. &gt;&gt; Like you would do a GoFundMe. &gt;&gt; Dude, I made parking free. Give me &gt;&gt; Wait, I have a real million dollar idea. &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; we make a We just lie. We make a GoFundMe. We lie. &gt;&gt; Make a GoFundMe. Let's make parking free in LA. And then &gt;&gt; if this get if this hits a million dollars, parking is free in LA forever. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, &gt;&gt; GoFundMe and we just lie. Isn't it this? Aren't people still paying for parking though? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; They're still having to pay. He's &gt;&gt; defrauding everyone. &gt;&gt; We would act like we are the the Los Angeles local government doing a GoFundMe, &gt;&gt; right? But let me explain this. If even if this weren't a scam, everyone is still paying an amount of money to get parking forever. &gt;&gt; Guy guy who rents his car and it's the same thing as owning it. &gt;&gt; It's not free. &gt;&gt; You're slim, you're also right, right? &gt;&gt; But I guess it's pulled by people who might not park. &gt;&gt; I guess it is. Yeah. Yeah. Someone in in Hungary could do this. They could contribute to the GoFundMe. Get scammed. I've got scammed again. &gt;&gt; Who just ate can also contribute. This is open to everyone. &gt;&gt; Let's just wrap it up. It's a horrible idea. And Dax agrees. But th this really is only happening because we happen to meet in a grocery store. &gt;&gt; Um yeah, that uh I think that sometimes in life you just don't Yeah, sometimes really small things can lead to unexpected things. So yeah. &gt;&gt; Dang. And then you asked him specifically later on in life in your human experience to come on this podcast. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; Well, um, people had asked said you should go on there a couple times, messaged me, and then I just like going on podcasts and so randomly the other day it just popped into my head and I messaged and I was like, I don't know if that's this is a weird question, but uh, can I go on your podcast? &gt;&gt; No, it made my whole day better. Uh, but I do I have a a question that maybe helps your question. Have you ever said no &gt;&gt; to a podcast? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Uh, yes. Cuz I used to hate going on them. &gt;&gt; Oh. &gt;&gt; But then this year I've been trying to &gt;&gt; So this year you've changed into being someone who really likes going on them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. What happened? &gt;&gt; I just have been pushing myself outside of my &gt;&gt; like out I've just been pushing outside of that more. The comfort zone. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Dude, you should go on. It's called Fresh and Fit. I think you would be &gt;&gt; I I think his perspective would be &gt;&gt; um is that the I think that is that the one that's like very um maybe like bro type. &gt;&gt; That's exactly the one it be the bros and then it's usually &gt;&gt; some um porn stars. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And then they converse about how they have disagreements. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. And but usually there's like nine porn stars. &gt;&gt; Yes. And two bros. &gt;&gt; And two bros. &gt;&gt; I guess you could be the third bro. &gt;&gt; So it's like or you know you can maybe see what the other side is like from their perspective. &gt;&gt; Dax Flame. Excellent male porn star name. No, that was not that was not intentional. But that is I mean that works. &gt;&gt; Is that a god-given name? &gt;&gt; Uh no. No, that's a stage name. &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. &gt;&gt; A stage name you created when you were 10. &gt;&gt; 15. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Dang, that's crazy. &gt;&gt; The stage name I came up with when I was &gt;&gt; I would have been like poop slayer. &gt;&gt; Mine was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] slayer. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that was the name I made. There's two wolves inside of &gt;&gt; I abandoned mine because it was crass. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; you're setting yourself up as like not a underdog. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Maybe an over &gt;&gt; like people would like not like you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That did end up happening. &gt;&gt; It did end up happening still regardless of the name which is a shame. You said you said when we walked in the room, you said um I have one thought and you said, "Should I save it for the show?" &gt;&gt; That was about the parking meters. I I was like, "Should I wait?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. I wanted to ask you about that, but I didn't know if you wanted me to wait. Can &gt;&gt; Can I ask you what do you think of Lwig in terms of like your interface with like not meeting him in a grocery store and stuff, but like what was your general idea of this guy from the internet? I had heard about you before and then um but I didn't know exactly how just maybe streaming then more recently I've gotten into watching people open Pokemon cards so I've watched you open Pokemon cards. I really love to watch that. &gt;&gt; Whoa. And then I had played uh chess. I started playing chess last year. So then your robot is on chess.com. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So I had played your &gt;&gt; You have a chess bot? &gt;&gt; I have a chessbot. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Is it dog [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; No. No, &gt;&gt; people just mog the chess bot. He's,200. &gt;&gt; That would have been before uh playing or watching Pokemon though. I I started to play chess early last year. Then I started to watch people open Pokemon cards and then I met you at the grocery store and um so that's so crazy. Yeah, I was playing your chess bot and then I ran into you at the grocery store and I thought I should go on your podcast. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that is an LA story. &gt;&gt; We have um you Mr. Beast &gt;&gt; XQC. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh, and maybe a couple other streamers. &gt;&gt; I I think I'm I'm 1,200. Did you beat me? &gt;&gt; Uh, I think so. I'm not 1,200 when I play against real people, but it's easier to beat the bots. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm a little predictable. I won't lie. &gt;&gt; With the infinite time as well, Eric reprint. Yeah, I I think we talked about it before on the pod, but the grocery store I I saw you and is I mean probably I think it's the first time I've gone up to somebody who I saw in public who I recognized and I said, "Hey, I just I like what you do." And then and that was all and then I and then I vanished. That was my whole plan. &gt;&gt; And then I probably said like, "Thank you." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Then you said, "Thank Yet I had red hair because I had dyed it red because of a rockathon we did. &gt;&gt; So then I went and looked up your most recent YouTube video to see if you had red hair in it and you did. So that's when I messaged you. &gt;&gt; I see. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If he didn't have it in the video, what would you have done? &gt;&gt; Just thought it was someone who I thought looked like him. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; I mean that's fair. That's fair. &gt;&gt; So many stars had to align. &gt;&gt; This guy looks like Lewig. Oh, guess it wasn't. &gt;&gt; Guess it wasn't him. &gt;&gt; And you were wearing the same hockey jersey in the video. So that's how I knew fit. Obviously. &gt;&gt; Yeah. When I wear some, it's like it gets two days out of me. Uh, are you are you often recognized? &gt;&gt; These days more so. Yeah. &gt;&gt; These days more so. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Especially if I go to the mall or something. A lot of like high school or college age people will recognize me. &gt;&gt; What's the most common thing from is it from Tik Tok and Instagram? I think. &gt;&gt; Wow. When was the shift for you of like Project X2 Jump Street to Tik Tok? Like like what at what point did people recognize you from Tik Tok instead? &gt;&gt; The past year and a half. &gt;&gt; Wow, &gt;&gt; that makes sense. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it does make sense. &gt;&gt; Tik Toks in real rule. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Mr. Mr. Flame, can I ask you a question? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When So, was 21 Jump Street your first? No, it was probably X was like your first like movie, right? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I did I have I I get clowned on this show? I'm 35 and I I never really watched a lot of YouTube in the sort of the formative years of YouTube and all this the past like 15 years or something. So, I get clowned cuz I don't know who like David Ghetto is. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; You know, I don't know who all these people are. They told me that David Ghetto was a Roblox YouTuber. I believed them. &gt;&gt; We convinced him of that. Yeah. &gt;&gt; It was crazy. &gt;&gt; So, actually, I've listened to maybe 30 minutes of this podcast and it was the one from last week. So, I heard that. &gt;&gt; You heard that? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That was real. I I we don't not play it up. &gt;&gt; In those 30 minutes, quickly, did you did you form a favorite? Um, well, I could only hear the voices, so I don't I didn't know who was who, &gt;&gt; but I know that you seem nice because now I know. &gt;&gt; Change your opinion. &gt;&gt; No, life is beautiful. &gt;&gt; Awesome. &gt;&gt; So, what kind of things do y'all like prefer to talk about most on here? And like, &gt;&gt; oh, whatever. &gt;&gt; Oh, science, math. &gt;&gt; We talk about science and math and all kinds of sciences, chemicals, &gt;&gt; amazing ideas. &gt;&gt; Amazing ideas. Yeah. A million dollars worth. And then I don't when I said I've only listened to 30 minutes, I didn't mean I don't really listen to any podcasts, so I don't mean that in like a &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, please. But no, no offense taken. In fact, anyone who listens to this show &gt;&gt; should be probably put in jail for 10 years, minimum sentence. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And then maximum sentence forever. &gt;&gt; Yep. But um I guess it's probably a common question you get, but how did you how did you did like they scoop you up and put you in movies or did you scoop yourself up and put you in movies? &gt;&gt; Yeah, there was an open casting call for Project X. So then I just got to submit a tape from Texas and then I got to act in it two weeks after high school. So uh they flew me out to audition &gt;&gt; two weeks after high school. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. in 21 Jump Street is like one of my favorite movies and you're really good in it. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; I I was like that's the guy from 21 Jump Street and you guys are like yeah he's he's more than he's done more than that. And I'm like stop judging me. Stop telling me what truth is. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And would you guys act in any movies or like have youall acted in movies? Well, &gt;&gt; oh, well, we just got a little our first role. Very, you know, I won't I won't call it because it's potentially Well, we're acting alongside uh uh Eric Rahill, who's going to be in the new office. &gt;&gt; They're extras. &gt;&gt; What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; Yeah, we got adding context. They're extras. &gt;&gt; What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; In a in what? In what? &gt;&gt; We don't even know what it's called. &gt;&gt; We had a friend. &gt;&gt; We had a friend shooting like a short and he was like, "Hey, come be angry guys in a bar." We're like, "Yes, &gt;&gt; cool." &gt;&gt; So, yeah. Well, we're not angry. We're preventing people from fighting. We're holding people. &gt;&gt; We're spreading love in a bar. Yeah. But I think this is probably the beginning, you know, you're an actor. This is probably the beginning of a long career of many roles. &gt;&gt; Well, is that how it works? It feels hard to get a movie role. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. It doesn't feel like you do one. &gt;&gt; Well, maybe. I I hadn't done anything. So, do you think that you do you want them to have a successful movie career? &gt;&gt; Do I want them to be successful? That's such a good question. You changed it to be so much more broad. &gt;&gt; And why did you not uh why were you not in it as well? &gt;&gt; I I wasn't asked. I wasn't asked. I I've yet to I've I've got nothing. I've never been in a movie. No one's ever wanted me. Uh I think they think I'm one note. And do I want them to be successful? I'd want one of them to be successful. &gt;&gt; Wait, a specific one or just one of us in general? &gt;&gt; Just one of you two? Yeah. &gt;&gt; You don't care which one? &gt;&gt; No, I do. &gt;&gt; I would love to hear which one. Yeah, you would. You would not. &gt;&gt; What? You don't want him to be successful. Come on. &gt;&gt; I want Nick to have a budding movie career. &gt;&gt; Why him and not me? &gt;&gt; Uh, &gt;&gt; do you cry on command? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Damn. &gt;&gt; Why him and not me? &gt;&gt; I just think I think you'd be I think you'd be more insufferable. &gt;&gt; What are you talking about? How would I be insufferable? You'd be insufferable eating at her every other every day instead of every other day. I'm imagining if you were may actually maybe you're right. I'm I was imagining which one of you if you were Bradpit famous would be more insufferable. &gt;&gt; Dude, I would live the exact same way. I live all the and I'd be like Bert Reynolds and I'd steal water in my truck. &gt;&gt; What would y'all's dream roles be? &gt;&gt; Oh, great question. &gt;&gt; Mad Men again. They just they they wipe Mad Men clean. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I I wanna I wanna be I want to be cast as Jack Harlo in a biopic about Jack Harlo. &gt;&gt; That's a great answer. &gt;&gt; So, he's a rapper. Uh yeah, I shouldn't assume you didn't know that. Um do I like him a lot? I'm inspired by him. I don't know if I like him a lot, but I think he's I think he's the dopest white boy doing it, and I think that's controversial, &gt;&gt; but I I think I could live I think I could live up to that role. &gt;&gt; Have you tried to get in contact with him? Jack, if you're watching, please, dude, he'd probably play himself. He's a good actor. I don't &gt;&gt; play Billy Mitchell. How &gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stupid. &gt;&gt; You might be older than him, actually. I might be older than I think you are. &gt;&gt; You're 100% older. He has that one song like Call me 24, but I'm still a baby. &gt;&gt; Can you look up Jack Harlo age? That would be tough. &gt;&gt; He's probably No, he's probably like 26. &gt;&gt; I I want to make you older than him. &gt;&gt; I would want to be Bellamy in the season 3 of the live action One Piece. &gt;&gt; What's your dream role? 27. &gt;&gt; 27. Damn, &gt;&gt; dude. He sucks. Damn little. &gt;&gt; Damn, I'm older than Yeah. What is your dream role? Told you cat. &gt;&gt; Um, maybe it would be cool to be like a superhero type, but I don't think that that's what I would get cast as. However, &gt;&gt; you never know. So, I don't know. &gt;&gt; What kind of superhero do you have? Like a preference? &gt;&gt; Iron Man. &gt;&gt; Spider-Man. &gt;&gt; You want me Spider-Man? I think I mean I think that would work. Ops flame Spider-Man. &gt;&gt; Dude, that would be money. &gt;&gt; I feel like people would come out and they'd be like, "Man, that's the best Peter Park we ever seen. &gt;&gt; Thank you." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; How are you when people are like, do people ever poke you and they're like, "Ah, Superman meme." Like, do do you get tired of that? &gt;&gt; Uh, it doesn't happen that often. Just a couple times recently when I'm like on stage and I Well, a couple times I've been trying to practice coming back for roasts. &gt;&gt; So, I've asked the audience to roast me. Um, and then a couple people shouted like Superman a couple of those times. &gt;&gt; It's It's not even a roast. It's like part of your Magnumocus, I feel like. &gt;&gt; Well, it's not really a roast. There's And it's really specific to just a maybe two people in the crowd know that. So, I I just kind of waited till someone else shouted something else. &gt;&gt; You um you've been doing a lot of standup comedy. Okay. You're also branching into podcasts. What What are your goals right now? It's not movie related. It feels like &gt;&gt; I'm just trying to figure that out. Yeah. Okay. &gt;&gt; It's normal and you don't have to have it all figured out. Guys like me and Dax in our 30s. &gt;&gt; Well, you have a podcast that you're on. Like &gt;&gt; this is piss ant [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to me. &gt;&gt; But do you make a lot of money? &gt;&gt; You asked He asked it like he knows the answer. &gt;&gt; Well, I do ask. &gt;&gt; I don't know how it's split up is the only thing. So, I don't know. &gt;&gt; Assuming that I make nothing. I've done something horrible. &gt;&gt; It's 98%. No. And the rest of us, there's a big dog bowl and we have to use our mouths &gt;&gt; to eat the $1 bill equal ownership. &gt;&gt; So then um he's not Why would he leave the podcast? The guy who I'm sitting in for &gt;&gt; what? He's asking such amazing questions. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he gets right to the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; I said he was like, "Where's the other guy?" Doesn't even remember his name because why would you? And and I'm like, "He's in Sweden." The first thing he said, "Why?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Just like that. &gt;&gt; Well, you said he's moving trying to move to Sweden. was curious about that cuz I think it would be a cool place to visit, but I don't know why you would randomly go. &gt;&gt; I agree with you. He likes the PewDiePie. He likes the culture. He doesn't like PewDiePie, I don't think. I think he likes the culture. I think he likes the ethnic makeup &gt;&gt; and he likes the weather. &gt;&gt; He's really interested in the homogeneity of &gt;&gt; homogeneity. &gt;&gt; Homogeneity. He talks about it all the time. every other episode. You You're lucky you missed it uh when you did your listen cuz he can't stop talking about how it's what what do he called it? A white paradise. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; All the time. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, &gt;&gt; with a dash of Chilean. &gt;&gt; Are y'all roasting him like that? He's a racist or is he actually &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The lines are blurry. No, it's hard. It's really hard. See, he's seen through us. &gt;&gt; Well, I I don't want him to feel concerned that he's sitting in for a racist guy and this whole time he's like, "Oh god, if I got on the wrong podcast." Yeah, that's fair. No, he just really loves Sweden. It's not super um It's not super obvious why. It's not It's not reasonable. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a yearning, I think. &gt;&gt; Do you have like a an obsession with something or does it pass through like Pokemon cards? Maybe. I don't know if you're obsessed with Pokemon cards, but like &gt;&gt; No, I just like to watch the I like to watch the Deep Pocket Monster Tik Tok or you know. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Is that the guy who does the uh should I open it or should I keep it sealed? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Did Max Mofo fell off? &gt;&gt; Max Mofo just stopped making Pokemon opening videos. Yeah, &gt;&gt; he was kind of the goat for a while. &gt;&gt; Uh he was consistent, but then like he only uploads around November, December cuz the ad revenue is higher. &gt;&gt; That's beast. &gt;&gt; What What That's awesome. What What were you the most obsessed with ever? &gt;&gt; Uh I guess just making video. I like to make video. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it makes sense. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It does feel like you have a boundless drive for that cuz you're so consistent and it must be hard creatively and also uh vulnerabilitywise. No. &gt;&gt; Uh well yeah sometimes you have to figure out new things to do. So in the last year I've been doing standup videos things that like try to brighten people's day such as the parking meter. &gt;&gt; It would it would brighten the lives of many. I think &gt;&gt; you was trying to brighten people's day. You were trying to make a million. That's the difference. &gt;&gt; Well, you would have to do it. If you wanted to make a million dollars, you would have to do do it like if you you said Mr. Beast. &gt;&gt; So, you'd have to make it a really viral video that you put an ad on. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I almost felt like that work would do the work by itself. It would it would go viral off of the virality of love &gt;&gt; kindness. &gt;&gt; Mine got a lot of views doing that. &gt;&gt; Did it? &gt;&gt; Oh, I I did it on Tik Tok less than a minute long, so I didn't make any money on it. &gt;&gt; Oh, see that's the problem. That's the problem. Are you are is Tik Tok you get a good amount of views on Tik Tok? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Does that not make a lot of money? &gt;&gt; Uh well, not all of my videos are over a minute long. So yeah, last month I made like $200, but I typically average like well for the past year and a half like $4,000 a month. So that's been great. But I have been doing shorter videos. But how does your typical What's his name again? Who sits here? &gt;&gt; Aiden. Aiden. &gt;&gt; Aiden. What What does he typically like? &gt;&gt; Oh. &gt;&gt; Um, &gt;&gt; should I try to provide more &gt;&gt; emulate him? How about this? &gt;&gt; I would love that. &gt;&gt; How about we we paint a picture of Aiden and then for the next couple minutes, Dax will try to be Aiden? &gt;&gt; Well, let's be honest, though. I think we were maybe characterizing Aiden. &gt;&gt; Okay. Let's We could be more We could be a more general. &gt;&gt; He's more emotionally mature. You're saying? Yeah, &gt;&gt; he wants He has a tail. &gt;&gt; Yeah, sorry. No, he doesn't have a tail. He doesn't have a tail. &gt;&gt; It's a NY one. It's not like a like a fox tail. It's like a nubby weird tail. &gt;&gt; He once did an episode of this podcast by himself and he brought himself to tears just by his own words speaking about his friends. &gt;&gt; It was pathetic. &gt;&gt; It was touching. He Aiden's the most normal of the lot. See, Lwig uh Lewig Lewig is a bit of an emotional husk. Um, I have unhealthy obsession with uh with uh uh work &gt;&gt; and slime fused the entire world's value through the lens of comedy and almost nothing else. Aiden is the most normal of the four of us where if one of us was in an Uber and had to talk to the driver and appear to not be strange. we throw Aiden in because Aiden can he he is excited to meet everybody and he uh is has the most friends &gt;&gt; which is why he has excellent stories &gt;&gt; and and so he has he has many stories he's very well traveled he hates living in the United States he wants to live anywhere else okay &gt;&gt; um however he is addicted to his phone and probably also porn which is I'm guessing there but uh he's on the phone so damn much it I can't &gt;&gt; there must be porn playing &gt;&gt; there must be porn somewhere involved in that equation uh often when we start the podcast Um, he's very bad at doing two things at once. So, if he's on his phone and I say, "Hey, Aiden." He just won't hear me. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; He's very locked in. &gt;&gt; It's as if he has headphones on. &gt;&gt; So, should I try to pretend to be him for a while? &gt;&gt; I would like that. Yeah. &gt;&gt; How long? &gt;&gt; Um, you know what? Let's go until it just feels like naturally we should stop. &gt;&gt; Okay. Uh, and we'll treat you like Aiden. &gt;&gt; He also voted for Trump five times in the last election. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. &gt;&gt; And action. &gt;&gt; Scene. Or not seen, sorry. And action.

We're going to go to France as a group. &gt;&gt; Uh, Aiden, I'm an Uber driver. Wow, there's nothing locked in. He's so locked into his phone. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we should we should behead him. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; I went on Atriox stream recently. scene. Wow. &gt;&gt; For a moment. I was there. &gt;&gt; I can't. It sounds like we're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with you. That was scarily accurate. &gt;&gt; That was literally I was just googling what a a recent Reddit post. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Wait, you said before you got on here you did research on all of us. What did you find? What did you learn? Me and me and Nick. &gt;&gt; Well, just uh Smash Brothers um that some that y'all are really good at Smash Brothers. &gt;&gt; So good. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Potentially in the elite, like one of the best. There's these things called the five gods. We're like basically right below that. &gt;&gt; Um &gt;&gt; shut the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. &gt;&gt; What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; They're both ass. &gt;&gt; You do the same [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You do the same [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] where someone will come. &gt;&gt; I watch I watched YouTube money match. Y'all are asking what happened. &gt;&gt; It was nasty. You guys look like new players. &gt;&gt; I was nervous and the monitor had a little lag and it was nasty. &gt;&gt; I beat him for $500 this past weekend. Smash Brothers. &gt;&gt; Yeah, in Smash Brothers. &gt;&gt; We played against each other and I beat him so badly that he lost 500. &gt;&gt; It wasn't so badly. It was a past fail. It was win loss. It wasn't badly. &gt;&gt; Did you let him win game three? &gt;&gt; Huh? Did you let him win game, bro? &gt;&gt; I genuinely didn't. &gt;&gt; He smiled a little bit when I asked. You see that? You see the smile creeping out of his body? &gt;&gt; He can't live with it. You cheated on Among Us and you let me win game. &gt;&gt; I didn't. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; There we go. Um, can I can I ask you something? And this is a vulnerable ask. You can say no. &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah, you can ask me. &gt;&gt; Can I look You have an iPhone? &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Do you have an iPhone? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Can I look at your most used apps? &gt;&gt; Uh, yeah, sure. &gt;&gt; I'm just curious over the past. &gt;&gt; You want to see the screen time? &gt;&gt; Yeah, screen time. &gt;&gt; How do I go there? Just &gt;&gt; go to the search bar and type screen time. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; And it'll pop up. &gt;&gt; I'm so curious. &gt;&gt; I am also curious. It was itching at me the moment you said I looked on on Reddit &gt;&gt; cuz &gt;&gt; Oh, well I don't have that app. &gt;&gt; That's fair. &gt;&gt; What? How do you do it? &gt;&gt; Uh &gt;&gt; I just go on Safari to look at Reddit. &gt;&gt; That's good. Aiden goes on Safari to use uh Twitter instead of having the app. &gt;&gt; I don't have Twitter on my phone at all. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. The Dex Flame history over the past week. Okay. First off, &gt;&gt; you're not on the phone too much. &gt;&gt; How many hours? &gt;&gt; Uh 4 hours a day. Okay, &gt;&gt; that's reasonable. That is reasonable reasonable and it's and it's I think it's all work. &gt;&gt; It's 9 hours on Instagram, 7 hours on Tik Tok. &gt;&gt; Oh, you real? &gt;&gt; Uh, really not really. I watch Tik Tok more, but I do watch reals some. &gt;&gt; How the hell are you spending 9 hours on Instagram, not real? &gt;&gt; Actually, I don't know. &gt;&gt; I mean, this is normal. The the weirdest one is that you're on Gmail for 2 hours. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I guess that is weird, right? &gt;&gt; Guy who people are begging him to check his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] email. Why are you on Gmail? &gt;&gt; I thought Gmail was kind of dead in a way. No dude, what are you talking about? &gt;&gt; Okay, I something really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. Okay, so I was logged into my bank app recently and they took my account that has the most amount of money in it and they put an ad under the money. &gt;&gt; That's crazy. &gt;&gt; It's insane. So, okay, paint this picture. So, so you saw in your bank account you have like checking, savings, whatever. the account that had the most money in the actual tab under the money there was a hyperlink to buy tickets to like a a concert. I don't remember the artist. It was some like Vegas style like mega show. &gt;&gt; And I was like unbelievable. There's an ad in my bank &gt;&gt; in my checking. It's not upside banner. &gt;&gt; I might be able to just pull it up. &gt;&gt; There's your bank. &gt;&gt; Let's shoot the CEO in the head. &gt;&gt; Dax, do you endorse that behavior? Uh, I don't know anything about CEO. &gt;&gt; You need more context. &gt;&gt; I mean, like Luigi Manion type stuff. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, that's kind of what he's suggesting. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Actually, I did a standup joke recently about him. Let me think. &gt;&gt; I'd love to hear it. &gt;&gt; Wait, I think I I can't remember if I lead into it. Oh, okay. Should I tell you? &gt;&gt; Yeah, please. &gt;&gt; Did you guys hear about Luigi Manion? &gt;&gt; I did. Yeah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; A liberal crowd. Actually, don't do that. Sorry. Okay. Sorry, I won't do anything. &gt;&gt; Did you guys hear about Luigi Manion? &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; It killed a CEO. &gt;&gt; So that's the joke is like you already know. You think I'm going to I'm going to say you think I'm going to say something new. &gt;&gt; Actually, don't do that. &gt;&gt; So wait, and then the the other one is um that's kind of related is the um the giving people the chair used to be a really popular form of punishment until they outlawed it in like the ' 40s or 70s or something. But I think that a free chair seems like more of a reward than a punch. &gt;&gt; Yeah, let's go. Very Stephen Wright joke. &gt;&gt; Well, actually, yeah. Someone um someone else came up with that joke for me. So, I'm not &gt;&gt; You got some writers. &gt;&gt; Well, whenever I was backstage at the comedy show, they said, "If I come up with a joke for you, will you tell it?" So, I said yes. And then told it. &gt;&gt; That happened to me this weekend. I went to a Big Smash tournament and someone came up and said, "Hey, I got one for you." We have a friend whose tag is shake drizzle. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And he said, "I got one for you. Cake Jiggle. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And I said, I'm gonna use that and I'm gonna credit you, but I don't remember their name. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So, it's mine. And that's how it works. That's show business. &gt;&gt; Well, it's mine now. &gt;&gt; I I guess so. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; I guess so. I guess so. &gt;&gt; Well, I have a question. Okay. So, you did a lot of YouTube, right? And then it's you're he's big on Tik Tok. Is this correct? &gt;&gt; He's big on Tik Tok and Instagram. &gt;&gt; Past year, I've gotten more popular on Tik Tok and Instagram. It's actually a beautiful spectrum of So I know so much about what you used to make. He knows everything about what you currently make and he doesn't know really anything at all. &gt;&gt; I know that he was wonderful in 21 Drum Street. &gt;&gt; We are a decent history of Dax. &gt;&gt; If we were combining our brains, we would have your career unlock. So, so do you, so I'm like kind of I'm a kerogen and I feel like the like YouTube videos are like something that was really cool and then Tik Tok feels like this sort of weird version of that that I don't really I guess I don't respect as much for arbitrary reasons. I don't think that's a correct thing to think, but I feel it. And do you do you not care about that? You're like, "Oh, Tik Tok's just another form of videos." &gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't care about that kind of thing. Um, but I also don't I think that you anyone can have any opinion, so I'm not judging you. &gt;&gt; Yeah, sure. &gt;&gt; But you never ran into like when the things change, did you ever get frustrated or you're just like whatever? &gt;&gt; Well, I was not relevant on YouTube by the time it changed or whatever. Yeah. &gt;&gt; What do you What's your opinion on the shift if you think that there is one of YouTube in general? Like my outlook on it is like when you first started making videos to now those are two very different websites. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Like the videos are different. The like thumbnails like the the presentation of video goal the goal of the user. Like to me now YouTube is like an attempt at getting a job and before it was like an attempt to just express yourself like oh I just have I'm just going to put this thing on the internet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What's your what are your thoughts on that? Well, it can still be that for anyone, but yeah, maybe now it's more like if you go viral, then you would think like, oh, am I gonna be on Ellen or something like that and whereas back like after the yodelling kid and stuff like that. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But then back and then if you would go viral, it would just be like a weird thing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And um &gt;&gt; then that's But yeah. Yeah. I don't I'm not like this I'm not the most articulate when it comes to like talking about the differences of that kind of thing. Like some people are able to say like uh yeah whatever they would say can't even play the role of the articulate person. I think I think even if you don't feel like you're articulate I think you have like you have a outlook on it that almost no one else could possibly have your perspective. Well, yeah. If you used it back then, you could tell it felt different in terms of like it just felt like you would &gt;&gt; like cuz you could send messages to people, too. &gt;&gt; And then you could uh which you can do on Instagram and stuff now, but you used to be able to do it on YouTube. And then you can also um &gt;&gt; like you could uh do the community page, but it was like on your main page, so it felt just a little more like a message board mixed with video making and and then you could do response videos. &gt;&gt; Did you prefer that or this? Well, &gt;&gt; ignoring your status in the in the world in that moment. Like, did you &gt;&gt; Yeah, different things have like different advantages. So, it's probably more fun back then like in terms of just like more carefree, but then it's also like people can make a living on it now and stuff. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I think that's a balanced take. &gt;&gt; Who's the most famous person in your contacts? Um, well, actually, Jack Carlo did um ask someone for my phone number a few months ago and then texted me. &gt;&gt; Can you just in if that ever happens to you again with any rapper, you just give him my number? &gt;&gt; He's the only rapper who's No, no, actually. Well, okay. Actually, yeah, he's the only rapper who's messaged me, but then &gt;&gt; King Von message him. He just doesn't want to say it. &gt;&gt; No, I don't know. I don't know King Vaughn. Um, but JPEG Mafia, I was in his music video and then he followed me, but I didn't we didn't message at all. &gt;&gt; So, you and Jack boys now? &gt;&gt; No. Um, uh, he just was like, "We should hang out at some point." And &gt;&gt; Oh, you would be better than me in the Jack Harlo biopic. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you better. &gt;&gt; You know what? Let the best actor win. Let's keep it there. &gt;&gt; Hey, cast it. Yeah. Audition. We can go cast for cast. So, he's probably the number one most famous person in my context. But what about y'all? I don't know if I have famous people like contacts. &gt;&gt; Um, &gt;&gt; actual famous people. I'll go through. I'll check. &gt;&gt; Lwig's mom. &gt;&gt; Let's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] go. &gt;&gt; She's a retired woman. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Most beautiful woman in the world. &gt;&gt; Planet. &gt;&gt; There's She is beautiful, but she's a retired French and Spanish teacher. &gt;&gt; Cool. &gt;&gt; Cuz she's appeared on this podcast, which I gives her some notoriety, &gt;&gt; but I don't think she's the most famous person in your context. Agree. Floodwig isn't in your context. &gt;&gt; No, it's also true. He's just like he's just a phone number in my phone. I've never I've never commit cuz I'm not really sure. &gt;&gt; You guys are being jerks cuz he answered the question real and you guys are just saying my mom. &gt;&gt; What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; You he answered the question real and you just said my mom. Are you just trying to be modest? &gt;&gt; Because the answer is you. You stupid. &gt;&gt; No, he's trying to He's trying to say something uh subvertive. &gt;&gt; Most famous to me &gt;&gt; Freddy Wong. &gt;&gt; That's for me. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that I think he is the most famous. &gt;&gt; Uh but I guess I don't know. Asa Asa Butterfield. Oh, he's in your phone. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's crazy. &gt;&gt; He's an actor. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Child actor and then he was in Sex Ed on Netflix. &gt;&gt; There's so many people. &gt;&gt; Famous also for being on the Yard podcast. &gt;&gt; Oh, cool. &gt;&gt; He was on here. We went to the UK to shoot with him once. Wow. &gt;&gt; Squeaks in here. &gt;&gt; Mine's Mr. Beast. &gt;&gt; Oh, wow. Awesome. &gt;&gt; I don't have Mr. Beast number. &gt;&gt; Is Are y'all friends? &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's a It's an interesting relationship, I think, when you're friends with another creator. Uh cuz I don't think I I don't think I know his middle name. &gt;&gt; Do you know &gt;&gt; Jimmy? &gt;&gt; I don't think it's Jimmy. Jimmy Jimmy. &gt;&gt; Mr. Jimmy Beast. &gt;&gt; Sir Jimmy Beast. &gt;&gt; Sir Jimmy. &gt;&gt; Knited by the Queen. &gt;&gt; He got He got so He was like, "It's Mr. Jimmy Beast. &gt;&gt; So cute with it." &gt;&gt; And I think uh I think that makes it hard to be friends with creators. I don't know. I always I I like to put up a wall. I think I have like &gt;&gt; You should send If I write a text to him, will you send it? &gt;&gt; I would send any text you want. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, really? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Do you want to think of one? &gt;&gt; Yeah. What's your middle name? &gt;&gt; Do you want me to text Mr. Reese? What's your middle name? &gt;&gt; Um, you're going to &gt;&gt; actually wait. Maybe if you you just have one, I'll think of something else. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Stay tuned until the end of the episode to find out and then I'll come up with I'm going to hold this. &gt;&gt; That's ancient YouTube tech. That's new tech. That's Mr. Beast advice. &gt;&gt; That's watch retention. You're right. Hey, I thought maybe you had &gt;&gt; So, and then you put at the beginning you say, "Oh my god, I can't wait to send Mr. or I can't believe I just sent that text to Mr. Beast." &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; And and people are watching this all the way through. &gt;&gt; Also, everyone put your foot on the fireplace. Last Take It Off gets a car. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's that's Mr. Beast, too. &gt;&gt; And can I use it as like a way to like self-promo or like try to get him to like, "Hey, me and a bunch of people are going to post Dax Flame's most recent TikTok today." Yeah, you go in on this with us. &gt;&gt; I'll do I can send him anything. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; If you want if you want me to call him a slur, I'll do it. &gt;&gt; Oh, wow. &gt;&gt; So, do you want you said you said off camera you wanted that? Do you want No, no. I I was &gt;&gt; I was thinking more like &gt;&gt; if you if if I was going to the like code red, it would be you sending a a penis photo to him. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Of my own penis. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But I wouldn't actually make you do that because then that would be awful for him as well. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, you know, he could be a treat. &gt;&gt; Maybe he was always curious. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But you guys don't talk enough and that's the problem. &gt;&gt; That is the problem is that like I would know if you guys would like to see it. &gt;&gt; Can I also post a tweet from your Twitter? &gt;&gt; You want to post a tweet? &gt;&gt; Yeah, why not? &gt;&gt; Okay, awesome. &gt;&gt; What would you say?

So, you're into trading cards? &gt;&gt; Only watching people open them. &gt;&gt; So, you don't open Pokemon cards yourself? &gt;&gt; Well, I have bought a few packs. I think I've spent a total of like $40. &gt;&gt; Oh, wow. &gt;&gt; So, what stops you from like going all like whailing out? Like there's a dopamine response of watching people open them, but you yourself don't. Sounds like you don't love them. It's really disappointing cuz it's like the ones you watch are like usually fun and then you spend money and then you open it and you're like, "Oh, that I just have a bunch of like empty like &gt;&gt; Polywags." &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then it's just I wasted my money. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You you miss so often. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; More than not. &gt;&gt; That's why the videos of people hitting are popular. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And why we pull such insane stuff cuz may maybe we will hit. &gt;&gt; So you're not a gambler. You don't gamble. Um, no. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that makes sense. &gt;&gt; Who's your uh who's your favorite who's your favorite creators to watch? Do you watch any &gt;&gt; monster? &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; A recent favorite.

I don't have one &gt;&gt; ever. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; Are you a movie buff, you think? &gt;&gt; Uh, no. &gt;&gt; You're not going to theaters often or &gt;&gt; Not that often. &gt;&gt; Do you What's a What's a movie that you really really like? &gt;&gt; I'm trying to think of what I've seen. Oh, uh, well, in the past year, I watched Anora. That was really good. &gt;&gt; Anora? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Fire. &gt;&gt; It's a heavy one. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a heavy one. It's good. It's a good movie. It's a great movie. Good movie, &gt;&gt; dude. Imagine it's like Anora. It's like Dax Flame, &gt;&gt; you know. Thumbs up. &gt;&gt; A thumbs up. I would recommend it. It's good. &gt;&gt; It is. It's a great movie. &gt;&gt; But I haven't seen Superman. &gt;&gt; I liked it. I haven't either. &gt;&gt; Should I do the tweet? &gt;&gt; Yes. Are you ready? &gt;&gt; Oh, you haven't? &gt;&gt; This is mine. &gt;&gt; How did you do You did both of those things at once. You thought of the movie and thought of the tweets. &gt;&gt; I haven't thought of the tweets. &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. But I thought it was been about two minutes. So I what what um type of subject matter are you comfortable with and how like and where what can you give me some guidelines? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I would say I would say um mostly concerned about uh something that could be too crass. I wouldn't post my penis on Twitter. Um &gt;&gt; guess it's not a free country. That's for uh Chad from Anything for Views to do. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. You know, there's there's kids that follow me. That's the only reason. And then maybe maybe something like I wouldn't &gt;&gt; nothing negative about other people in the world. &gt;&gt; Not even that necessarily. I wouldn't I just wouldn't promote like &gt;&gt; I know anything else, man. &gt;&gt; Um I mean I'm It's a pretty small list. &gt;&gt; Oh, and it has to be a banger and you have to be able to put a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] uh Manscape ad on it. I'm just saying let's avoid Hitler. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Let's avoid peace. &gt;&gt; What if it's like I don't like Hitler. &gt;&gt; I guess we can avoid that. &gt;&gt; We avoid Yeah. Saying things like that. &gt;&gt; That would be fine. &gt;&gt; That would be fine. Okay. Hitler tweeted this. &gt;&gt; See what happens when you put up all these rules and regulations. &gt;&gt; No, that's good. That's helpful. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Well, I have I have no limitations. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you can you can pretty much run whatever. &gt;&gt; Wow. So, a penis on yours is fine. &gt;&gt; His? &gt;&gt; No. if he posted. &gt;&gt; Oh, so we have to give him the meat and then he could post it on behalf. &gt;&gt; He says, "Get a pick of your meat." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; I mean, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it. &gt;&gt; And the caption is open for a fun surprise if you're under the age of 18. That you're okay with that? Cuz you said anything's fine. &gt;&gt; I don't think Dax Slane would do that to to us. &gt;&gt; But yeah. Yeah. So, I have to trust that he wouldn't do that. &gt;&gt; Well, that's why like I I'm going to give away all my Pokemon cards to one lucky person today. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. And then it's a penis. &gt;&gt; No. Oh, no. I just won't make you do like a big promise or something. &gt;&gt; Oh, I saw a fake giveaway. Yeah, &gt;&gt; cuz that would be fun, too. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm excited. &gt;&gt; I actually don't have any good ideas, &gt;&gt; honestly. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Why don't you just say the first thing that comes to your mind? &gt;&gt; Yeah, usually the first idea you have is the best idea. If you want, &gt;&gt; you might think that an idea of yours is not very good, but I think it would be one of my best. &gt;&gt; I see you click clacking away. &gt;&gt; Dude, what are these pants?

Um, well, no. &gt;&gt; Fashion for ugly people. The horrible slogan. &gt;&gt; But then, yeah, I guess no one would want to buy it cuz they're admitting something to &gt;&gt; Diamond Supply Co. has that covered that and Huff. &gt;&gt; I know. It didn't matter what brand you said, it's it's a knock on them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Basically, anything in Zooies. Um, &gt;&gt; yeah. Hey, you've been beefing with &gt;&gt; I got beef with Zooies. Sorry, man. Are you So, you're sending This is an essay or a tweet? &gt;&gt; Uh, it's like a tweet, but y'all can uh like approve it or not. First and cuz I don't know if this is like a bad thing or like a fine thing. &gt;&gt; Um I'm I'm anxious. I'm feeling anxiety. &gt;&gt; You would feel anxiety. &gt;&gt; So long. &gt;&gt; It's almost like excitement. It's like, you know, before &gt;&gt; you're afraid that it'll it'll mess with your beep deal. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Beep. the preferred brand for beep. &gt;&gt; No, I What about like I So I said, "I'm going to quit the yard podcast. Sorry to tell you abruptly, but something happened in the past few days, so I will share more soon." &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm cool with that. I love it. In fact, in fact, yeah, I love it. Okay, I would change nothing about it. Do you want me to do something different? &gt;&gt; No, you can hit the send button if you want. Okay. &gt;&gt; What if Yik tweets it out, &gt;&gt; dude? Wow. And then we lose How many patrons did we just lose? We lost like 10,000. &gt;&gt; Oh, no. This is good because then we we we &gt;&gt; And then on your tweets I could say, "Please don't leave the Patreon." &gt;&gt; Cuz we we have we'll have some better stuff coming. &gt;&gt; And then yours is like &gt;&gt; you want to wait a few minutes or &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay, &gt;&gt; dude. And then you tweet out, "Damn, this today sucks." I just tweet out nothing goes right for me. &gt;&gt; But will this make will this make people sad or will they know it's a joke? &gt;&gt; Uh &gt;&gt; I think some people might pick up that it's a joke. We've talked about having you on and maybe it's but we've also never really done anything like this. &gt;&gt; It would depend. I mean, if you if you were to add fuel reinforcing this through their tweets, people I think would start to believe. &gt;&gt; And maybe you could say like nothing goes my way or something, whatever. &gt;&gt; Or like something like the thing is &gt;&gt; and you could say I like I did something bad. &gt;&gt; That's the tweet. &gt;&gt; He has that aura, right? You said, &gt;&gt; "Hey, you said it." He can say anything. &gt;&gt; He said he says I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up seconds ago. You're okay with &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; with the penis. &gt;&gt; All right. You want me to tweet it? I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. Uh, okay. &gt;&gt; What would you like? &gt;&gt; Uh, well, whatever. Uh, &gt;&gt; if you want them to believe it, it would be something like that. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then I'll I'll I'll edit it for syntax to make sure it's like my voice. &gt;&gt; Okay. And you said that you would say it like that. &gt;&gt; Well, is this bad though? Will people feel upset? Um, people will feel some people may celebrate like our biggest haters. &gt;&gt; Well, maybe then you can do like a giveaway. &gt;&gt; Yeah. We make parking free and this is how we get our million because we don't lose our patrons &gt;&gt; because they have forgiven us. &gt;&gt; It's a million in opportunity cost. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; I love how it keeps kind of funneling into some sort of giveaway. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. His mind is is a is a a bountiful place full of ideas. &gt;&gt; It's ancher painting. &gt;&gt; Why are you with zooies? &gt;&gt; Uh you know the story. I've told it cuz I &gt;&gt; You have? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Cuz on my on my seven I was 17 &gt;&gt; and then yours could just be like why does things happen like this? &gt;&gt; You can just rip it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. How about you want to type it? &gt;&gt; He said he said I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. I betray everyone and I'm sorry but I will share more details soon. &gt;&gt; Is that what you would say? &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean &gt;&gt; we're going to have you're going to have the most anxious 45 minutes ever. &gt;&gt; Oh my god, bro. It's it's it's slightly more maybe melodramatic cuz it's I betray everyone. &gt;&gt; I betray everyone is. It's like what would what would he say instead? Like maybe more &gt;&gt; I I wouldn't change it personally. It's perfect. &gt;&gt; It's &gt;&gt; it's actually so it's like it's so unlike what he would actually say that I think people are going to believe it because it seems like he's out of character because he's panicking. &gt;&gt; Did you tweet yours? &gt;&gt; So then I can text Mr. Beast, "My friend Slime betrayed me today." Yes, you can. Yes, we give him the phone and let him say that. Yes. &gt;&gt; But what's And what's your middle name as well? &gt;&gt; I got two big ones for you today. All right, here you go. &gt;&gt; But should I should I text that or some &gt;&gt; whatever you want. &gt;&gt; Whatever you all you if you want a self-promo, if you want to ask his middle name. &gt;&gt; You didn't reply to his team water text. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I didn't reply to his last three texts. &gt;&gt; You didn't reply to Team Water? &gt;&gt; Well, he called me after. That's why. No, &gt;&gt; he texted me and then he Are you team watering this year? &gt;&gt; H I sent mine. &gt;&gt; I just said, "Hey, bro." And then after he replies to that, say, "Can I say can I ask you something?" &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Oh, so it's a lot. Okay. So, you're playing &gt;&gt; It's a hook. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Then whenever he replies, &gt;&gt; it's a hook. Can I ask you something? I've been betrayed today. &gt;&gt; So now, do you want to say yours on &gt;&gt; Yeah. What do you want? So here, I'll just give you &gt;&gt; Okay. I don't know if this was what you expected. He did reply, &gt;&gt; Mr. Beasted. &gt;&gt; Yes. He said no. &gt;&gt; Oh. Um, okay. I'll say it's actually important. &gt;&gt; Okay. I'll I'll rotate this for you. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; It's actually important and say, um, I'm nervous. &gt;&gt; I'm nervous. &gt;&gt; He's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all of our lives. &gt;&gt; Ask him what he's wearing. &gt;&gt; He said, &gt;&gt; "No, don't ask that cuz I want him to &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm on a call, but text me." &gt;&gt; Uh, okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Uh, well, actually, you don't have to say okay. I'm trying to think of what &gt;&gt; Oh, sure, sure, sure. &gt;&gt; Say say &gt;&gt; you've really set up here where he he's like maybe a little like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] He's on edge. &gt;&gt; So, do you want to call him instead? &gt;&gt; No, no, no. He said he's on a call, so I have to text him. &gt;&gt; You could say it's very important. I can I call you? And then I could stand over there and with mouth what you should say to him. &gt;&gt; So, you want &gt;&gt; Well, maybe not. Actually, &gt;&gt; you want you want So, despite him saying I cannot call, you want Li to push through. That would be too hard to pull off. I think &gt;&gt; I think you're I think it's a bit it was it would probably be a weight situation. &gt;&gt; We're asking a lot of Jimmy. Beep beast &gt;&gt; because we don't know the middle name. &gt;&gt; We don't know the middle name. &gt;&gt; I'll just I'll just I'll start typing. &gt;&gt; Would you say that this is &gt;&gt; this is Nick's tweet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Or &gt;&gt; this is this is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is very ominous. That would scare people. &gt;&gt; This is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is very good. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's good. &gt;&gt; Or this is bad. &gt;&gt; Dude, this is like &gt;&gt; No, this is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is better. &gt;&gt; We got Dax on. is burning down the podcast. &gt;&gt; Wow, it's sent. &gt;&gt; Oh man. &gt;&gt; The moniker. &gt;&gt; I'm going to look now. I have to &gt;&gt; Maybe you could say I'm trying to figure out how to put this. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, like a very lead on figure out what to say. &gt;&gt; Oh, you're just trying to figure out what to say, &gt;&gt; right? Over text. &gt;&gt; Do you want Do you want me to say give me a second? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Give me a second. &gt;&gt; He's probably on some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] call. Like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is going on? Letting letting Dax Flame pilot the mech suit of the yard and he's just going around smashing buildings. &gt;&gt; Do you do you know um Luca Donuch? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I do. I do. &gt;&gt; Cool. Um &gt;&gt; you want you want to text him? &gt;&gt; I don't have his number. &gt;&gt; Um no, but that's cool. I saw that clip of him saying, "Hey, Lewig." &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. The the Luca clip. &gt;&gt; Yeah, there was an assault rifle. &gt;&gt; Are you a basketball fan? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; What's your team? &gt;&gt; The Lakers. &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah, me too. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I just I I noticed that when you know something, you will still ask as if you don't. You like, "Do do you know Luca?" What would you have done if he said, "No, I don't." &gt;&gt; Actually, okay. I actually &gt;&gt; I didn't know if he knew him &gt;&gt; or if that was just a one-time promotional thing. &gt;&gt; I see. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But I do also ask people things I already know in case I'm wrong. &gt;&gt; Well, he also lied to you because he doesn't he doesn't know him. He knows of him. He's seen him around. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's how I was interpreting the question. I didn't think the question was like, "Are you boys with Luca?" That's what I meant. I was like, "Do you know Luca Donuch?" Like, like, "Oh, do you know David Ghetto?" &gt;&gt; Oh, I know of him. Roblox YouTuber. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that business, &gt;&gt; but I I I've never I don't I've never talked to him. I We got the video and then our teams are in contact. &gt;&gt; Cool. Okay, cool. So, I was able to ask the favor of him making the video. &gt;&gt; It's also so funny that in all of these tweets that have just gone out, Aiden did not send one. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Cuz he's obviously not here. Yeah, but &gt;&gt; maybe you should maybe you should send one. That's something like I just joined a podcast. &gt;&gt; He's off X. Oh, you're off. &gt;&gt; Well, I I my login is memorized on Safari on my laptop. I don't know the only way. &gt;&gt; I might actually have this password on my &gt;&gt; It wasn't on the screen time. This this this this clears. &gt;&gt; How did I betray you? &gt;&gt; I don't know. But you always do this. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; you always betray. &gt;&gt; You always betray. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Did uh did did the Ice Cream Man documentary did that provide like a meaningful shift in like your your life? &gt;&gt; Yeah, that helped me a lot. &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, basically I was just working at an ice cream shop and um had no momentum online or anything and then um Well, do y'all need to check your Twitters or anything? Like, do you need to delete those or anything? No. Cuz then I got Yeah. Yeah. So then then I had a lot of like just momentum from that and then I started to make a game show from that. Um and then Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You see you see how scared Lewig is right now. His phone is in his lap. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; I have the Mr. Beast message. &gt;&gt; He has not replied to the give me a second. &gt;&gt; And he just silenced his notifications. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. That's Dude, that sucks. &gt;&gt; Maybe say hello question mark. Come on, jump in. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Maybe say hello. He You heard the man. &gt;&gt; I sent it, man. &gt;&gt; I sent it. &gt;&gt; This is the It's the great It is like, &gt;&gt; bro, it's like the bait messages that like people send to their significant others on TikTok as like, uh, can I ask you something? It's actually important. I'm nervous. I'm trying to figure out how to put this. Give me a second. Hello. But that's what I have sent you. Now I have to think of what it is. &gt;&gt; Yeah, this you've really set up for like a home [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] roll. &gt;&gt; I know what it is. So, um, well, you don't have to send it yet, but Well, basically, I filmed this video with him and Well, maybe you have to bleep this. Well, so I had this video, but they said maybe I can't post it. So, then you can ask for permission for me to be able to post it. But I filmed like this video where it's this is actually going to be very disappointing for everyone, especially since I'm saying to bleep it. So, never mind. I'll think of something better. &gt;&gt; Wait, let's not bleep it. Do we have to Is it bleeping? &gt;&gt; Okay, so the video Okay, you could just share it and then hopefully when it comes out someday if it does, but it's a video where I had him say, "Hello, everyone. I just bought Dax Flames account for a million dollars and so now I'm going to take over his account, but they haven't given me permission to post it. So maybe I could use your power to get them to let me. But no, actually don't say that. I'll think of something better. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we can do that. &gt;&gt; No, I don't want to use it for personal gain. I want to &gt;&gt; come up with something. You wanted us to do I want it to be like a fun thing that everyone enjoys. &gt;&gt; I see. Well, I you know what? Then I'll work on that on the side. &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. Okay. &gt;&gt; I can work on that on the side cuz I I want to see I want to see Dax succeed. I guess on that note, what is success to you? because you've been talking a bit about money and like the financial aspect of doing content creation, but I think there's also probably like an artistic pursuit or what do you want &gt;&gt; just to to keep making videos and to avoid going back to an ice cream shop type situation &gt;&gt; and want to be able to make videos for the rest of your life? &gt;&gt; I think so. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I I I resonate with that. I the most miserable I've ever been was when I worked at a coffee shop. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. And when I finally got out of that job, I my vow to myself is like, no matter what I do, I will never go back to a job like that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I that's been my goal always just to avoid that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, what where's the line? Right. Like what if you had to make videos that sucked? &gt;&gt; Is that as bad as an ice cream shop? &gt;&gt; Do you mean like make videos you don't want to make? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Like if if the videos were only is only candy or something. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Then I wouldn't like that &gt;&gt; though. So it's not just making videos. next video you like. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That you like. Yeah. &gt;&gt; True. True. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh if you make a video, a movie, whatever, and you make $10 million from it, are you going to keep making videos or do you retire and go to the Bahamas? &gt;&gt; I would keep making videos, but then yeah, I just never have to think about money again. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that would be tight. If if if you could if you could snap your fingers and you could pick like exactly I'm assuming the answer is making videos, but like assuming the money didn't matter and it would all be the same amount anyways. Like would you prefer to make videos on YouTube? Would you rather be in movies? Would you rather &gt;&gt; I like making them on Tik Tok and Instagram right now? &gt;&gt; Oh, more than YouTube &gt;&gt; right now? Yes. &gt;&gt; You would want to make a movie. Like do you have a &gt;&gt; Well, I have directed one movie. &gt;&gt; Um and that was fun, but I don't really have a desire to do that again anytime soon. It was no budget. It was just It was called making YouTube. It's about the creation of YouTube. And I played the bio. It was a biopic about Chad Hurley. &gt;&gt; The guy who made YouTube. &gt;&gt; Was it a feature? Was it Oh my god. You directed a whole feature? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; How long did it take? How long was the shoot? &gt;&gt; Well, we filmed it in one week and it was very intense. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. And there was zero budget. But &gt;&gt; And you directed and acted in it? &gt;&gt; Yeah. And wrote it. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. Did you Who How big was the crew? &gt;&gt; Maybe Five or six people. That's intense. Wow. What? &gt;&gt; And I had to write it myself. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Did you like writing? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. What What part of all that process did you like the most? Acting. Directing. Writing. &gt;&gt; Directing is fun. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. &gt;&gt; And acting. &gt;&gt; But writing is the bottom one. &gt;&gt; Yeah. M &gt;&gt; do you write your uh do you write your like Tik Tok or real ideas out before you're doing them or are you just doing them? &gt;&gt; Sometimes I'm just walking around. I'm like, "Oh, that's a funny thing. I'll make a joke about that." But then other times I'm like, "Oh, today I want to go to the Griffith Observatory and pretend to propose to this girl to make strangers happy type thing." Um the the parking meter one just was on the spot. That wasn't pre-planned. I have one I'm going to film today and then that one is planned. And another one I just bought some props for. I'm going to do like a fake valet. I'm And then I'm going to wash the person's car when they drop it off to me. &gt;&gt; The My favorite one is there's this group of girls. It's like this girl pop group. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. They're awesome. Five. &gt;&gt; Have you seen this? &gt;&gt; No. He's doing this collab video with this group called Five and he orders pizza and then he's going to surprise the pizza delivery guy with a show. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; of of this, you know, of this pop group. And then the driver comes and doesn't want to be on camera. So the video ends and he's like, "The driver didn't want to be on camera, so see you later." And then it ends. &gt;&gt; Well, did you see the sequel? I did see the sequel, but I was I was curious like most people I think when that happens, it's it's a it's not what was meant to happen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But I only had a limited amount of time with them so I couldn't shoot again. &gt;&gt; I see. So you couldn't be like, "Let's wait for another pizza delivery." &gt;&gt; No, but so that was when I was in Tokyo and then that just happened to work out. Then they came to LA to do a show. So that's when I did the sequel and um we did get successfully uh do they did a performance &gt;&gt; smooth that over with them in real time because that's what I was thinking of was like what's the room after where you're like okay this is the plan the pizza guy comes we do the performance and the pizza guy comes and doesn't want to do the performance you're like all right he uh &gt;&gt; no they were disappointed but I was like but they were also they're just really positive and friendly and so then I was just like don't worry like this will still be a positive video and stuff I think and then yeah no one minded. &gt;&gt; You're also telling them it's a gamble. &gt;&gt; I think both videos are probably bigger for it having gone this way. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; True. True. &gt;&gt; Which is the beauty of it. I don't It's not planned on your end clearly. But &gt;&gt; yeah. And what do y'all like best out of Tik Tok, podcasting, etc. And what is y'all's dream goal? &gt;&gt; Oh, like Oh, like that we do. I like doing the podcast the most. &gt;&gt; Cool. &gt;&gt; Um, &gt;&gt; but that's not your dream goal. &gt;&gt; Um, I don't know. My dreams have shifted a lot. I mean, if you asked me, I know you're just dying to know what's going on in that little phone. &gt;&gt; Seeing if Jimmy was replying. &gt;&gt; Um, no, but he looked he looked at it like you had a treat. &gt;&gt; I'm doing the Aiden roll. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He sees the phone and he's just like, "What's that thing do? I want to look at it." &gt;&gt; Um, I don't know. My my my goals have like changed a lot. You asked me like four or five years ago, I'd be like, I want to make a feature. Um, do I want that now? I think I would be open to that now, but I don't think I'm aiming towards it anymore. would you what would it be about? &gt;&gt; Um well me and Slime are writing not a feature but we're writing a show um about about esports um because that's what we know and and we think it's a very funny world. But uh that's and that's like my I would say outside of the podcast my biggest like creative focus is doing that. I'd love to make that real. Uh but I think I've I've learned that like I grew up on the internet and for a long time I I got really wrapped up in this idea that like traditional media is more like legitimate. like if I were to make it to be a movie or make a movie that would be more of an accomplishment than like something on the internet, but I think that's not true anymore. And I'm more interested in making stuff on the internet, I think. So, like if we did shoot a film, you know, it'd be cool to like go to festivals or have it in the theaters, but I'd also want it on the internet. Um, kind of first and foremost. &gt;&gt; I'm still that guy. I I not that I think traditional media is more more important or relevant. I just like it more, I think, and I I resonate with it more. So, the show we're working on, we actually had a meet, we were supposed to have a meeting for one of the episodes today in the writers, the me and two other guys. And Caleb Pittz is one of the writers and he didn't show up for the meeting. &gt;&gt; He just he No call no showed. &gt;&gt; Who is that? &gt;&gt; Um he's comedian in New York. Uh he has a &gt;&gt; You know, you know Pierce Campion, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. They were very close. &gt;&gt; Oh, cool. I know Pierce. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I've known him. Well, I just met him randomly like maybe eight years ago or something. &gt;&gt; I was with him a week ago and he brought you up and I was like, "Oh my god, I'm about to meet him." &gt;&gt; Cool. &gt;&gt; Yeah, Pierce is cool. Uh Caleb Caleb's on the show or he's he's writing on the show and we have a meeting where we call and we talk about the episode and he just didn't show up at all. So, we do the meeting with the three of us and then we're like, "Caleb, are you okay?" And he just doesn't message us. Message him personally, nothing. A day later, &gt;&gt; he had diarrhea. He had explosive diarrhea and he passed out at 6 p.m. Oh, dang. &gt;&gt; And we thought he died. We were like really scared. &gt;&gt; I said a meeting with no CP. I don't show up. &gt;&gt; I don't show up to that meeting. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Meeting with no CP. &gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz then what are we going to What will we even talk about? &gt;&gt; We're talking about my favorite football team, Crystal Palace. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Uh, so yeah, it's kind of the same. I'm actually I'm living the dream because we're working on something I really like. So &gt;&gt; cool. Yeah, that's kind of my answer to is I really love doing the show. this show. &gt;&gt; I don't like it when Aiden's here. So, this is the best time. &gt;&gt; This is such It's If if you want to just come back every week, &gt;&gt; you have no idea how much Yeah. more I like you. &gt;&gt; We We will tell Aiden that we're recording and we'll do a whole hour and a half with him and then we just won't post it and we'll do a real one with you. &gt;&gt; Can I actually make a request? Have you ever played Dungeons and Dragons? &gt;&gt; Nope. &gt;&gt; Well, well, Dax Flame. &gt;&gt; Dax Flame. &gt;&gt; We are actually premier Dungeons and Dragons players. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Recently launched a show. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Um, and you know, we uh &gt;&gt; we were talking about having a a guest episode for Dungeons and Dragons. &gt;&gt; The idea, have you watched it before? &gt;&gt; Dungeons and Dragons. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Um, no, but I know kind of it's like you do role playing and come up with your character and there's a dungeon master. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; But I don't really know how you win or lose. Oh, the it's a it's it's variable, you know, and I think you find maybe cornally that it's not about winning or losing. It's about &gt;&gt; you win if you have fun about the friends you make along the way. &gt;&gt; Cool. So, would you ever be interested in maybe doing that? &gt;&gt; Do you want to be our first guest? So, &gt;&gt; yeah, I would do that. That would be fun. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; No, I think you'd be I think you'd be crazy. &gt;&gt; Oh my god, you'd be the best guest ever. &gt;&gt; Maybe. Well, actually, this would be too much of a disappointment, but I could say maybe the big Jimmy text comes then, but that would probably be too long to wait to complete that. &gt;&gt; I don't think he would like I don't think he'd remember. I don't think he'd be like, "Oh, &gt;&gt; he has a lot going on." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I don't think I think he might have deleted my number. &gt;&gt; If you say like, "I have a million dollar opportunity." &gt;&gt; That's not a lot for him. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. True. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. You You have to say, "I have you. You have to say maybe like I woke up in a big circle and I can't leave. What do I do? &gt;&gt; It's like I've seen this one before. I got &gt;&gt; Dude, I can help you. What if you say &gt;&gt; It feels like every text It feels like every text you're sending is setting up for an eventual text that you don't have. &gt;&gt; You can't something mad. &gt;&gt; Maybe you say hello one more time. You want you want me to do a second hollow question mark or maybe just say well how did what would you say in your voice like hey man what's up &gt;&gt; in your voice? &gt;&gt; So I'm I'll read you back the script. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Hey bro, can I ask you something? No, it's actually important. I'm nervous on a call but text me. I'm trying to figure out how to put this. Give me a second. Hello. And now you want me to say hey bro. Dude, this is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] awesome. &gt;&gt; Um, let's see. Hey, bro. Are you free now? &gt;&gt; You really want to call? &gt;&gt; No, he doesn't have to call. &gt;&gt; Just say, "I I Cuz I don't want to text this." And &gt;&gt; free now. &gt;&gt; You can say, "Cuz I I just want to send a text, but I don't want it to be hanging too long after I send it. So, just let me know whenever you're free to answer my text." &gt;&gt; Can you explain the minutia of that? Can you explain how you He doesn't want the text to hang too long. Like I I don't want the text to be something that can be permanently sort of captured. &gt;&gt; No, I don't I don't want to doubt even sending it in the first place. I need you to reply quickly for that to not be the case. &gt;&gt; Are you free now? I have the text ready to go. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. It's so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] unbelievable. I'd be so mad. &gt;&gt; So mad. &gt;&gt; I'd be so &gt;&gt; I'm sure he's mad. &gt;&gt; No, cuz he's he he has like a lot of things going on. So, he's probably just like doing a Fastables call. And then &gt;&gt; Well, what's funny what's funny, Dax, is because I had this open cuz I thought he might reply because he had been replying. He switched from replying quickly to it says Jimmy has notification silenced. &gt;&gt; Yes, he went to DN &gt;&gt; in the in the duration. &gt;&gt; That's what you could say. You could say, "Could you turn off the &gt;&gt; Could you turn back could you turn off DN D?" &gt;&gt; Wait, can you could type in all caps. Hello. You can try to yell past it. &gt;&gt; Well, I don't want him to seem like he's like I want him to seem like it's going to be like a good thing. &gt;&gt; There's a button that says notify anyway. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you can push. &gt;&gt; Oh my god, I just clicked it. &gt;&gt; I didn't realize it does. &gt;&gt; What did you send it? It was the text from previous and it says are you free now? I have the text ready to go. And what happens is it blasts through this do not disturb and on the screen on the iPhone it goes and all and it takes up the screen, &gt;&gt; dude. You're never &gt;&gt; This is Christmas to me. &gt;&gt; I'm never being invited to do anything again. &gt;&gt; Yeah. No, this is probably it for me. &gt;&gt; Would you go to the Beast Games premiere? &gt;&gt; Would I go to the Beast Game? I watch all of Beast Games season 1. It depends where the premiere is. &gt;&gt; Maybe you could say I like Maybe the important thing could be like that you have a Beast Games idea. &gt;&gt; He is giddy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Literally giddy. &gt;&gt; Well, maybe it could be cuz it's supposed to be vulnerable, so that wouldn't be good. I I almost think I there's two routes here. &gt;&gt; One is we we ask for the tax flame footage. &gt;&gt; Well, I have the footage. &gt;&gt; Sorry. &gt;&gt; Permission. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I could ask someone, but they'll probably just say we'll ask someone and then they won't hear back. &gt;&gt; Well, that's why I'm saying I &gt;&gt; He has the power to ask. &gt;&gt; I could do this right now. And that I think that's a successful end to this. &gt;&gt; No, we don't. I think it should be something that I don't want it to feel selfish. &gt;&gt; I see. It's so selfless because we're doing it for you. &gt;&gt; Well, I don't want it to feel like uh if you're a viewer and you're like, "Oh, wow. He just is just trying to get uh he's just trying to promote himself to Mr. Beast." &gt;&gt; I can promise you it's very low on the list of what any viewer is currently thinking. &gt;&gt; Oh my god, he's calling me. &gt;&gt; Well, you don't Maybe say Can I call back? &gt;&gt; Can't talk right now. &gt;&gt; What should he say? &gt;&gt; Well, maybe say Okay, say that you had a cool idea for Beast Games, but you're too shy to tell him what it is. &gt;&gt; Go ahead, Lick. And action. Yo, what up, dude? &gt;&gt; Howdy. &gt;&gt; Sorry, man. Did you finish your call? &gt;&gt; Uh, hit me. Yeah. &gt;&gt; All right, cool. I just had an idea for Beast Games. &gt;&gt; Okay. The We just finished filming season 2, FYI. Hit me. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's done. What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do I do now? &gt;&gt; Say, um, my ideas always go poorly. I should have known. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; It's my bad. It was a bad It was My ideas are bad anyway. All right, that was that was it. When's the premiere? &gt;&gt; Uh, you're breaking up. When's the premiere? &gt;&gt; Is I can't Are you live like doing a bit? &gt;&gt; No, I'm not live. I'm &gt;&gt; D. He was He was not having your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; He sounded He sounded not happy. &gt;&gt; He sounded pissy. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. which is fair. &gt;&gt; Well, you could say, "Hey, sorry. I just got nervous." Um, yeah, you could, &gt;&gt; dude. This is like Christmas to me. I've never &gt;&gt; say just say, "Yeah, sorry. I got I got nervous." So, um, I I I I often have ideas, but then they don't go how I wanted, so I got nervous. &gt;&gt; Or say maybe, well, actually, maybe I don't want to um ruin your friendship. So, uh, now I'll let you take the unless you want me to do more. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm calling the police. Are you okay?" &gt;&gt; Well, maybe say, "Um, yeah, I got nervous. Let's talk. Let's catch up soon." &gt;&gt; Yeah, I got nervous. Let's catch up soon. &gt;&gt; That's a good conclusion. And then people will be like, "And &gt;&gt; he's going to he's going to call the cops." I can't. You sounded like you sounded like someone was holding you hostage and they said you have to steal Mr. Beast's money. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; That's what he thinks. &gt;&gt; Dude, that'd be awesome. &gt;&gt; And then then you could put at the beginning of the episode like, "Oh my god, I can't believe I just did that." &gt;&gt; He said they're on the He just said they're on the way. &gt;&gt; They're on the way. &gt;&gt; Yeah, like the police. &gt;&gt; Okay, well that's fine. Yingling can greet the police. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Well, they don't know. They don't know how to get in. So, &gt;&gt; yeah. What do I say to that? you I mean in in the span of less than 90 minutes, you've &gt;&gt; you've disrupted our lives. &gt;&gt; You've disrupted our lives immeasurably. You've burned this place down. &gt;&gt; It's really fun to be able to send tweets from other people's accounts or text people. Especially like texting Mr. Beast from someone else's phone is really fun. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You don't get that opportunity very often. It doesn't come up, I guess, in the normal dayto-day. &gt;&gt; I I have a question. What Who do you think is really funny? &gt;&gt; Um, those friends I mentioned earlier. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then I've been trying to watch more standup comedy recently. &gt;&gt; Who are you liking? &gt;&gt; Um, Mitch Hedberg and Shane Gillis and um Sebastian Maniscalo and I'll just put on a most popular standup on Spotify playlist. &gt;&gt; Oh, really? Okay. Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; Whenever I'm driving. &gt;&gt; Okay. I have a I have a wreck for you. This one I think molded me and it's a very it's kind of niche, but it's Comedy Central presents Pablo Francisco, &gt;&gt; a 30 minute special from like 200 one. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; I think it still holds up today and I think it built my sense of humor and I would You're watching a lot of Santa &gt;&gt; Pablo Francisco. &gt;&gt; Okay, I'll definitely watch him. &gt;&gt; I don't have a Santa. Watch One Piece. &gt;&gt; Okay. Um, is that a show where you need to um like watch some episodes before it starts to get really good or is it one where you can just jump right in and it's fun to watch? &gt;&gt; I think I think it's fun fun from the beginning. Some people think it takes roughly 500 episodes. &gt;&gt; I do like watching anime, but I haven't watched anything for a while. I like the Miyazaki movies. &gt;&gt; Oh, the Giblly ones. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What is it? What's your favorite? &gt;&gt; Uh, Spirited Away is awesome. &gt;&gt; That is awesome. Did you cry? &gt;&gt; I don't think so. &gt;&gt; When's the last time you cried? &gt;&gt; I cry a normal amount. I don't remember the last time exactly, but probably within the month, like at a touching thing on Tik Tok. &gt;&gt; Oh, Tik Tok. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Sometimes you just see some really sweet stuff. &gt;&gt; You cried on Tik Tok? &gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely cried on Tik Tok. &gt;&gt; You see like a AI dogs like not AI dogs. More like &gt;&gt; I saw the bunnies on the trampoline. I burst into tears cuz baby Spider-Man saved baby Batman from peril. &gt;&gt; Um I Yeah. What what makes you cry? For me, it was I cried at like multiple things. I cried at the animal once. &gt;&gt; Sometimes they do like animal rescue. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; it's like the dodo and it's like we rescued an animal &gt;&gt; and they're like washing oil out of it out of its feathers. &gt;&gt; Uh I think I cried at a military come home compilation. &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Kid military [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] primary consumer man. You are just like &gt;&gt; they're really good. They are really I mean it is classic true blue. It's a classic. &gt;&gt; You know what got me? It was actually on Twitter. It was just from I think from Tik Tok but I sent it to Lo because it's this guy this young guy living in Japan. He's like this white guy and that's just important cuz it's like usually Lo was like usually these guys are cringe but he like goes up to this old man on a bench and he starts talking to him and then the old man invites him into his house and they go and have he has dinner with him and his old wife &gt;&gt; and it's very very sweet. &gt;&gt; Just his wife. Well, she wasn't young. &gt;&gt; And I was like, and I sent it to a lot of I was like, "This damn near made me tear up because they're very sweet." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he's like, "Usually this guy's legit. Usually these are cringe, but this guy's &gt;&gt; the beauty of humanity, &gt;&gt; man. We're If you if we asked you to be in our show, would you do it?" &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; If we asked you to be in our our TV show, would you do it? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You would do it? &gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely. &gt;&gt; All right. You're your cast. Would you act in it? &gt;&gt; I I don't I don't know. They've never asked me, actually. Would you We're gonna get here. &gt;&gt; Would you do acting? Like do you think that you could do acting? You said you're One Note. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Also, &gt;&gt; you said One Piece was a good show to watch and it made me think I I told them I've been watching I've watched the first two seasons of Game of Thrones recently and then that popped. &gt;&gt; How are you feeling about Game of Thrones right now? &gt;&gt; It's really good. &gt;&gt; It is, isn't it? &gt;&gt; And then I know to be disappointed for the last season. But anyways, sorry. &gt;&gt; Uh you do you think you could do good acting even if it is the one note thing you said? &gt;&gt; Yeah. No, I crush my note. &gt;&gt; Cool. &gt;&gt; I think I play a just a like a like a big [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Pretty well. &gt;&gt; You could be a Game of Thrones type character. Like you have like a face like a prince charming type thing. &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; Yeah. I think so. If you had like long hair. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Dang. &gt;&gt; We hate to give him that cuz we've been giving him that for years, but it's true. I think honestly, unironically, I think that if you ever wanted to do like like Broadway stage acting, I think that's your niche. &gt;&gt; That's my niche. &gt;&gt; Not niche. Sorry, it's not niche, but like that's your I think you are a very performative &gt;&gt; really hard to get into &gt;&gt; for this guy. I'm telling you, he's &gt;&gt; I think that one's way harder. &gt;&gt; I just think it's your acting style. I think you're you're very like you you have like a stage acting style. &gt;&gt; That's the biggest insult you could give someone. &gt;&gt; No, plays are awesome. Why &gt;&gt; it that they're saying is not subtle I could give somebody &gt;&gt; you're saying you act for stage. &gt;&gt; It's a different thing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But like it basically means like you act like a cartoon character like you're Ronald McDonald. &gt;&gt; I I think no. It's like you act in a way that is not lost on people in a room. &gt;&gt; You're just rephrasing what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; How about it's you're making it meaner. &gt;&gt; What if we give them the same scene to do and see who does it better? &gt;&gt; Yeah, we could do that. I would love &gt;&gt; Yeah. Give me a scene. What's my scene? &gt;&gt; So, you have to just do a monologue about how people usually don't like your ideas, but um and you thought you had a really good one, but then you blew it. And then you could just reply like just as like however you would reply. &gt;&gt; So, he's the person that I'm trying to tell the idea to &gt;&gt; and then I'll just watch it and see who does better. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Can you direct? actually. &gt;&gt; Well, it's kind of just I &gt;&gt; You can give me Well, you can give me adjustments after if I &gt;&gt; Well, the this is a contest, so I'm not going to help either of y'all. &gt;&gt; No, fair enough. &gt;&gt; It's an audition. &gt;&gt; Who do you want to go first? &gt;&gt; Uh, who wants to go first? &gt;&gt; I'll go first. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. Where are we? What's giving me the world I'm in? Is it here? &gt;&gt; That's your dad. And he &gt;&gt; Yeah, that makes sense. The age &gt;&gt; um casting &gt;&gt; and y'all are in like at a pool party. Okay. This is my dad. We're at a pool party. A lot of people. Wow. Okay. Um, you took him aside. &gt;&gt; Can you actually just play like miscellaneous like crowds murmuring? &gt;&gt; You took him aside into a quiet uh behind a tree. &gt;&gt; Okay. And then when I take when I finally take him aside, I want you to lower the volume on the video as if I'm taking him aside. Uh, let me &gt;&gt; Do I get to do this monologue or am I being judged on my dad acting? &gt;&gt; Uh, no. Cuz you you don't seem to have any care about whether you're a good actor or not. &gt;&gt; Oh, I do. I wanted to be better than him. &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. Yeah. Put it all into being dad. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'll do I'll &gt;&gt; Sure. Sure. Sure. &gt;&gt; Uh and it'll monologue. It's like you you jump in. Um are we good over here? Ready? &gt;&gt; What if you texted Jimmy now? What are you up to? &gt;&gt; Miscellaneous crowd murmuring audio sound effects. And then when I pull him aside in the script, I want you to lower the volume as if we're leaving that room. &gt;&gt; Did you just hear what he said? &gt;&gt; What? No. &gt;&gt; He goes, "What if you text Jimmy now, what are you up to?" &gt;&gt; You okay? Right. I was I getting Yeah, I'd get back in character. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Um that'd be crazy. Um just play the sounds whenever you're ready, man. &gt;&gt; And then Yeah, cuz you had an idea for a cool like a cool invention or something. &gt;&gt; A a cool invention. &gt;&gt; But you don't have to say what the invention was, but just like &gt;&gt; Well, I don't even know if I'll get out business idea that didn't work out. &gt;&gt; Um All right. Give me Give me action. &gt;&gt; Oh, action. &gt;&gt; Um Hey, Dad. Hey, what's up, kiddo? &gt;&gt; Are you Are you drinking again? &gt;&gt; Oh, no. This is just um &gt;&gt; You told mom you wouldn't drink anymore, &gt;&gt; dude. Put it in the pool. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Miss Johnson. Um &gt;&gt; she's cheating on her husband. &gt;&gt; Can I talk to you for a second? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, sure. Whatever. &gt;&gt; Just walk over here. &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Um I just have this idea. I want to run. &gt;&gt; Sorry, that was really smelled really bad. &gt;&gt; I have an idea. I want to run by you. Um for for an invention. &gt;&gt; An invention? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry. No. No. You know, actually, never mind. I don't I don't want to tell you the idea. It's stupid. It's &gt;&gt; Well, I mean, you pulled me aside. I was having fun. &gt;&gt; We can just go back to the party. Maybe. &gt;&gt; Actually, it's a business idea, not an invention. &gt;&gt; It's actually a business idea. I just remembered, not &gt;&gt; business idea. Well, I mean, now I'm listening cuz I &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. Okay. &gt;&gt; I always told you to make some money, get out there, do some stuff. You're 23. You &gt;&gt; um I just Okay. Okay. It's business idea. Well, you know how you have that at one time? I found that flashlight in your room and I I thought I needed to see in the dark and it wasn't a flashlight. I opened it up and it was something else. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; Um &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; what if I just want to know what if they made those with AI and they were also they were they were made of boy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] instead of &gt;&gt; actually a different different thing. &gt;&gt; Okay. Um uh &gt;&gt; or actually you don't have to tell them what &gt;&gt; what if it was what if I don't have to tell them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. Um so before I tell you the idea, can I is this so are my hands stuck like this forever? Is this this is really what I'm afraid of is I have a business idea. &gt;&gt; Can I say one more note? Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Don't do anything funny. &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. &gt;&gt; And so you can put your hands normal. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Put them on my side probably if that's funny. &gt;&gt; What's up, kiddo? Your hands look really normal. &gt;&gt; And actually, I think that's a good enough &gt;&gt; scene. Right. Okay. &gt;&gt; Well, I think that was actually really good acting. &gt;&gt; Wow. Really? Yeah, actually. Yeah. Okay. I I felt I was there. And I'll be the judge now, but then commenters can be the final judge. But then, so do you want to do one also? Yeah. So, I think that um like you know, you threw that into the pool and like you don't don't do anything like that this time. Just so I can really focus on Yes. My fault. Yeah, absolutely. &gt;&gt; And then is it okay if I lean like this? &gt;&gt; Yeah, of course. Yeah. Yeah, of course. Honestly, if you want to go over there, you're welcome if it's easier. &gt;&gt; This is okay. Okay. Action. Are you ready? &gt;&gt; I'm ready. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. Action. &gt;&gt; And one question. Did you want the murmuring too? &gt;&gt; No, I don't need all that. &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; I'll just start. &gt;&gt; Y'all are already over &gt;&gt; in the choir room. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. Action. &gt;&gt; Hey, daddy. &gt;&gt; Hey, kiddo. &gt;&gt; Also, one note. You're 17, so you're not going to say daddy. &gt;&gt; He still would probably. &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. &gt;&gt; But I can say daddy. &gt;&gt; You're right. You're right that it's weird, though. &gt;&gt; Whatever you would say then. Okay. &gt;&gt; Hey, Dad. &gt;&gt; Oh, hey kiddo. &gt;&gt; Um, pool party's fun. &gt;&gt; Yeah, having fun. Miss Johnson's over there. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's cool. Um, I kind of wanted to share something. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; It's It's an idea I've been working on, but it's mostly like in my head right now, but I haven't been able to tell anyone. &gt;&gt; Okay. I mean, would you like to tell me? I I'd love to hear it. If I tell you, can can it maybe be like a I guess like a conversation? Like it doesn't have to be like a like it's not a good idea, so it doesn't have to be like a judgment, I guess. &gt;&gt; Okay. Awesome. So, I think that was really good, too. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That Wow. &gt;&gt; That I think that maybe y'all have different strengths, but y'all are actually both really good. I think maybe um maybe y'all would have different specialties. &gt;&gt; You see seem like you were a a little more naturalistic right away, &gt;&gt; but then yours is felt really vulnerable and um like like emotional. So, um, &gt;&gt; like maybe he's really been there before and he's channeling some real Maybe &gt;&gt; I was thinking about like sharing stuff that I didn't want to share. &gt;&gt; Oh, you can do that if you I Okay. Did you have &gt;&gt; That's just what I was in that head space to be able to tap in. &gt;&gt; So, I think you can both do good jobs. &gt;&gt; Check this out. &gt;&gt; Your turn. &gt;&gt; I would love to take a shot. &gt;&gt; Yes. So, now um now everyone comment who's the best between them and now we'll see if this will be the best one. But the only thing is who's going to play the dad this time? I could play the dad. &gt;&gt; Dad, I feel fine. So, yeah. So, have them. So, you guys leave a comment now and then leave another comment. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; So, you're going to leave your first comment and then leave your second comment after this performance. &gt;&gt; The comment between us and then this is the comment if he's better. Okay. &gt;&gt; Two separate. &gt;&gt; And do you want to be a good actor also? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, um do you want the murmuring? &gt;&gt; No, the murmuring I I can. It's in my head. &gt;&gt; Okay. Action. &gt;&gt; Hey, Dad. &gt;&gt; What's up, kiddo? &gt;&gt; Uh can I talk to you for a second? I I got some stuff on my mind. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, I mean, go ahead. &gt;&gt; Everything I do isn't enough. Every idea I have, every thought, every desire doesn't come together. &gt;&gt; What? and and I and I try to talk about it with people like you and mom and and my teachers and nothing nothing makes sense and I'm scared. I'm scared that nothing ever will. &gt;&gt; It's okay, kiddo. I was like that when I was younger. It'll polish out the years. &gt;&gt; That's really good. Actually, that was that was super good. you maybe had the most visual distress. However, dialogue started to go a little too um monologuy, but that's what I originally said. Like it sounded almost like like too much like a movie at that point instead of naturalistic. Okay. &gt;&gt; And so, but uh that is because you're improvising it. But I thought you actually maybe had the most &gt;&gt; uh distressed of the three. So, actually all super good actors. Wow. &gt;&gt; And that's from a that's from the decorated movies. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Do you want to maybe give it a shot? &gt;&gt; Um Well, &gt;&gt; well, we all tried it. &gt;&gt; We all tried. &gt;&gt; We could be the dad. &gt;&gt; We could be your thrpple dads. &gt;&gt; So, okay. So, maybe this could be more like Shark Tank. &gt;&gt; Dad tank. &gt;&gt; That's an amazing idea. &gt;&gt; Yep. And it's three gay fathers. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, we are three gay dads. Um, and you are coming in to pitch your business idea. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You think it might not be a good idea, but you do know what the idea is. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. So, um, hey guys. Hey, what would I say? Never mind. &gt;&gt; What a party. &gt;&gt; Oh, great. Fresh bait coming back into our show again. &gt;&gt; Can, uh, can someone say action? &gt;&gt; Action. &gt;&gt; Um, is it okay if I talk to y'all about something? Uh, I mean, you're on the show. That's cool with me. I don't mind. This is a show. &gt;&gt; No, no, it's still gay. It's not like a It's a It's &gt;&gt; We're not actually on a show called Dad Tank. It's still &gt;&gt; Oh, I really liked that idea. &gt;&gt; Well, it's a good idea, but it's the same acting show. So, we're just dads. &gt;&gt; We're three gay dads. &gt;&gt; And we're And we're going to try not to step on them too much &gt;&gt; from the top. Are we all in a room? &gt;&gt; Yeah, we're all in a room together. We were hanging out talking about just gay father stuff. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it smells like dog surgery. Uh, &gt;&gt; what does that mean? &gt;&gt; I don't know. None of us know. We I couldn't explain it to you. The [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] does it? &gt;&gt; All right. Are you ready for this? All right. &gt;&gt; Um, so &gt;&gt; action. &gt;&gt; And then is it at a pool party or y'all just hanging out? &gt;&gt; Pool party. We're in the other room. &gt;&gt; Pool party, but we're in a quieter room. &gt;&gt; Just And then Okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Action on you. &gt;&gt; Is it okay if I come in here for a second? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on in, kiddo. All right. And &gt;&gt; I just had something that I wanted to talk to you all about. &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, what is it? It's more than anything.
