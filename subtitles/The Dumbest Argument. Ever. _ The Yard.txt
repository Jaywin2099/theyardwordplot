I thought you were traveling business class that's right sir that's interesting that this is such a moral dilemma for you given that the seats are nice and you can lay down and sleep know if you sleep in business Windows better this is insane it's better being insane it's inarguably well something can't be better 000 something can't be because when you sleep in the aisle you are like you see in like you're open and you have less space I literally don't you literally do because I'll show you it's the Airbus 320 if you want to look it up it's Lu tanza and they I've been on a Lu tanza airb 320

that thought to myself I had the thought no that's fine it's not lame I think and so I decided to pick it cuz I had the thought the whole CL having the whole AIS to yourself having the whole aisle to you in business class makes no difference having the whole rad to yourself means nothing in business class because you have a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bed to laay down and you you like you were like hey no I

you then I just mean of like YouTube culture oh so now you the gold post they I can't see them they've gotone so far away [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this is deo is it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Deo time whoa who [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stood on that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hell look at that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pigeons oh that's meing he a dead he a dead J kid dead I can't believe that guy my God I actually I actually cannot believe that guy edits our videos you know Argie does know about Devo which is funny cuz Arie was like five when Devo came out uh which is which means it shows the depths of how into culture Archie is is a viral video or is he famous outside of this uh I mean that video is pretty famous but he had a series the same guy that made Salad Fingers he produced Deo yeah we talked about f um but yeah it's a it's a jewel of my my teenage development cuz he's you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you gu Bend [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you guys you guys know how like uh people will just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] makeup [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and post it on Mi the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah and like our friend Ken Chen like Ken Chen uh and just post on there see if they can get it talking we talked about yesterday yeah and then I read this this one popped up on Reddit it was just it you know some story of like am I the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] if my like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 36-year-old husband I'm 20 female like is mistreating me for this and like and we've been together for 2 years so it's like yeah so when you got together he was 34 and you were 18 you graduated she's just like eloquently explaining this guy being a piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I'm reading this and I'm like this just seems convenient you know it's written in a way that it's like this is obviously I think this is somebody trying to get Reddit Karma and I go to this guy's profile and or or girl's profile and I read every other thing on this profile is them on a League of Legends jungler subreddit talking about like J tearless and like and like what's good in the meta right now every single comment and then there's one gigantic well-written post about how their like older boyfriend's abusing them wait he he didn't even get on an ALT to to scam the system no nobody nobody checks clearly and every comment on the post is like not the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] can't believe this guy is doing this and it's like I'm and this person is literally talking about like whether or not VI is still good in like this season by wa what's wrong with someone who plays a little league on the side and then gets screwed over by an X this can't happen putting in lightly look it could happen they can't play scarner because it's the meta and also get hoed I just notice the way that they wrote on the jungler subreddit was very different than the way they're it's called code switching dude Reddit code switching just putting epic bacon everywhere I just like started I was just cuz I've been I've been told this and I've never I've never dug into it and I think I've had the ideas like a lot of Mi the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] posts are like extremely convenient yeah uh that uh are just like not the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bait I would say so so Reddit bought it hook line and yeah yeah this was like top voted that's why I even got it made they always buy it but I started digging through the top post of like the recent time and it's like it's most of them I was like Blown Away that it's like this just kind of like pro wrestling though just like yeah I think you'd rather live in the universe where it is real and it doesn't matter if it's F I just I think it sulles people it's like rage bait it just sulles people's view of the world for like no reason like if you actually if it is true and you actually have a problem but like I feel like nobody who's writing that problem who has that problem would be presenting it to Mi the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in an open question well that's you not believing women but maybe yeah I maybe I'm going to the dark side and and we and we fiddle with sticks mhm how does it make sense cuz you're saying that we have make any sense what does that mean in context of what he said mentioned junglers L was excited about that but what is US fiddling with stick fiddles with sticks I'm not going to let this go you can't you could let it go why would we have guns in relation to what he said it doesn't matter yes it does it doesn't have to matter getting gr is way think slime salty keep away is the way you're m slim clim salty cuz he keeps trying to do word play I never get it oh dude it's crazy how he doesn't get it he always says something I'm just like I don't know what you're saying and then I explain it and then you go oh that is good and then the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the moment's gone I go limp my dick's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] soft as a goddamn I'm still down to finish my God you got there say you let him get away with the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I didn't hear it what did you say I said you got to stop the volley Bear Let's Go dud let's go I think Lilia is hot wait SE okay actually speaking oh uh I I've been deep in AO what's that am I overreacting oh I them all the time the same sh different [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on some of them are some of them are real of course think a lot more of them are real and they're just looking maybe they're looking for up boats but I feel like they're just looking for validation and being right yeah cuz it's always like am I overreacting and it's like a screenshot of their significant other cheating on them and it's like am I overreact what I think about every time I read threads like that too is it's like it's like therapy it's like when you the pro I would say a potential problem with with therapy or these types of posts is that your who you're speaking to only gets the information that you present them they don't get an honest third party's view of situations they get what you choose to share with them and then they get to build their opinion from that well now Aiden I would say this is not a problem with therapy because therapy is not solving your problems the therapy is about your own resolution within this problem so the other the other information doesn't matter you're right this was happening on Twitter cuz there was that like person who posted like I can't handle a 10 out of 10 girl and then it's like yeah cuz she was asking for $150 she's asking for like 150 bucks and he's like you seriously need to find another guy like I can't afford you I can't afford you and then she like quote retweeted it with like him being mean to her and it went really viral and then he quote retweeted it like a day later with her cheating on him like for three years and then like the last message after him being like well I'm mad you cheated is like her being like can you please get me this and it's it is crazy the window that we were given and we see into these people's relationship and that's all you think it's real yeah 100% I think these are two real people I what as far as what their actual relationship is you know the easiest thing is go ah it's toxic and then just stop watching it's weird I think you wonder sometimes like is this real or not and then you remember like there was like you remember talking to a coworker and then then describing their partner and like yeah he just does that sometimes you're like what what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that's happened a lot in my life and then you realize that like there's a lot of dysfunctional relationships out there for a lot of people and uh it's easy when you just don't like we have very comfortable lives where we don't have to like meet new people have you guys ever had Partners who have asked you for money like like shopping money never once in my entire life I've never that's something I hear about a lot and I've never once experienced yeah I've never that's never happened to me but maybe it's just cuz I'm broke as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] youve only had like I've had I've had like five different partners post having money oh I mean I guess having like a lot of money no one not even like a lot I just mean like like a I know I feel like in high school it would be very weird for someone to be like yo can I have like a hundred bucks cuz you're a high school it's like ah I had a job yeah I know but like you're a high schooler I guess I guess it'd just be like yeah I guess well I got I got my first job because my girlfriend at the time had a job and I felt broke yeah were I was like I was I was broke feel broke this broke I know I wanted to buy her stuff I was like oh I'll get a job no this has never happened to me uh but it's because I'm so damn Charming I'm that's what I was because you're so Charming they give you money I Get Money I Get Paid they give you money for your presence and you find out you're actually a prostitute secretly yeah no I'm a Vibes prostitute you people they pay me come cultivate A vibe or ruin a Vibe cultivate a VI are you I would never be ruin the room what's your refund ball hey guys what are you guys up to everyone do you want to play SL the SP board game look at the side that would hit though by the way like this P board game people do like it I know I'm saying that would hit if he pulled up that would hit well then that'd be a VI that'd be a successful Vibe prostitute vies procured it would be like that Dark Souls Vibes procured you wanted me to go cuz I baed on cu's Friends giving I wanted you to go bailed and because you're feeling bad cuz I was like surgy I messaged her and I was like hey my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] face looks like there's a baseball hidden inside of it and I can't eat solid foods and then lwig messages me he's like you got to go man well okay she messaged me she's she's cuz she's all worried cuz she got a rag tag group yeah she got 20 [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] who's and whats and have them and yeah it's the Island of Misfit Toys and she's and she's their savior like nice The Island of Misfit Toys and I'm like let's get lot of hug and bear in that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I'm like and she's like slime's not coming I'm like and she was all stressed and I was like I was like don't worry baby I got this here's her stress her stress was the idea that I'm a social glue oh which I I know he is I don't think that's necessarily true in a large group setting is he the social grou look let make no mistake I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] awesome but in a larger group setting I tend to to recoil yeah uh all you would need is to be El El for 45 minutes to get the Vibes going but would you say he's usually Electric in that setting I think yeah I think he hits I think he's electri he's Electric in small groups it was a lot of it it was I think Miles Zeke uh like fan fanan fan Fan's mother you know he would had a ball with that me and fan Fan's mom would have smoked a half a blunt and talked about some real [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] would have been smoked we would have talk about Stardust I think so you smoking it with her in I think slime would have connected the Zeke miles to the f f and what I told what I told which is that's the bridge you have to cross like who's crossing the bridge but but I said I was like dude miles is going he will unite all worlds miles is the social GL miles can be yeah miles can be too so know I didn't actually buy this I think that he was just trying to say something nice to get me to go and he actually didn't believe it this my whole [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you're monkey my monkey yes unwash your monkey un so I tell I tell my girl I go don't worry about I got you and I sent a message to slime he's like I really can't come I was like ah and I go back to her I was like never mind I sent a picture of my face I was like this is why I lied I played I played Lee with him I think not that night but the night after maybe and D he was just like what up and I'm like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you sound a lost six right dude I I had to wear a uh I had to wear like a thing in my mouth it was like a retainer that like is plastic over the top of your mouth and your teeth I have that you can't even talk it's it's like it's not even like wearable

shorts or Tik Tok or well it's both but but yeah your sound of every girl as a craft drawer has gone insane you didn't know this I didn't know this I didn't know this either dude it's massive I want are you talking are you like Ninja right now uh the Aiden craft drawer meme is huge it's big enough to where people posted it constantly on the subreddit and it was a sound that was transplanted to like a ton of different Tik toks wait that's sick and like girls talked about it like 20 like 100 2,000 I don't know man I want to take your time try to find an example yeah an example of the Zi listening and what am I supposed to say to like all these aunts and uncles like I we don't have the rizzler on our show we don't have the rizzler yeah we don't have [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we make one oh again the rizzler I do think was formed in a factory that's what I'm saying I to make our own he's like an X-Man who but if you can if you can make one if I can get one bite I can figure out the recipe can't say that you can't say about the rler man just trying to suck on the R's finger nutmeg weird he's like he's a little America sweetheart he is which is he was in that Mr Beast oh no that's the other one the big Justice he was in the little Justice right or is it big justice justice a little there's no little Justice in the same vein of people like building building narratives and assuming things from like the limited amount of information they get and immediately saying things and taking sides and D uh what really popped off recently was they all went on Jimmy Fallon and there was a bunch of like Jimmy Fallon body language dissection like Jimmy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hates these guys videos yeah I saw that and I in in a similar vein I hate that type of content CU Jimmy might just like them he might but Jimmy Jimmy Fallon is also like a worthless industry scumbag yeah so why spend any time on it on him is like it's kind of it's It's like a good thing to do it's like is that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on him though yeah because you're taking the side of the RIS you're calling him in authentic I think is Kevin Hart not an industry shell bag Kevin Hart he's he's P he's different he doesn't uh host a TV show or sorry a talk show he does wait does he yeah the uh IC I forget what they call it you the talk show uh maybe talk shows it's like a well his restaurant closed down I think you're on if you're on network talk show TV I don't think Jimmy Kim bad as jimy um I think Jimmy Fallon specifically sucks uh I think it's fine I think he you might be looking around still but if could you pull up Jimmy Fallon super TF uh episode it's very funny which one um the one I think with Sinatra I think I think they might have been on both but he there's two of them yeah there's one it's a zoom call and there's one with him and Sinatra uh yeah dude he is Jimmy Fallon is hammered during this and he's not even trying to hide it you go to a spot where Jimmy Fallon's just talking dude super old haircut made his forehead look how do you know he's hammered uh you just have to play it and listen I don't know what East fors is but I know what fors is yeah uh and so now do do you travel with the team or what like yeah like what is life like like you wake up in the morning okay wait pause what you are just like the people Aiden was talking about you analyzed Jimmy f i watch this I watch this if if you watch the whole thing I think it's pretty clear he's just like wow that's so crazy I watched this when this came out and I didn't have that thought uh well that's cuz you were 16 did not come out that's long ago was that long ago but I don't know call me crazy man I think he sucks no but that's what I look I think you're right Aiden people someone sucks and then they extrapolate cuz they suck just make up [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they make up [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about the person because they suck but I think they can just suck and you can take the real reasons they suck as a reason hate them as opposed to make up Reas I also got fed video with some channel that that fed me a video about uh how Logan Paul and Jake Paul like hate each other and they have no chemistry on their podcast they got said to me and I'm like At first I fall for it cuz I click and I'm like I don't like these two people I'm you guys areal aspect they can just be shitty without overanalyzing things like that lying is awesome lying is cool and it's fun as hell and then just when I thought I was out he pulls me back here the thing though I cuz I saw it I saw the clip of Jake Paul and Logan Paul and they're like arguing and uh I think in the same context and I don't like those guys and I watch this like they obvious like each other this is fine yeah that's what I thought so I'm not like I I don't think I'm blind to this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't think you are either just I don't I don't mean you specifically I actually don't I I didn't even bring this up with you in mind but what I'm saying is in your when the when the rizzler went on Jimmy felon yeah and talking saying that in that tone it just kills me inside but when the rizzler went on Jimmy Fallon and and Jimmy Fallon didn't seem to Vibe with AJ big Justice and the rler and the booms and the Dooms right uh I think yes there was some overanalyzing going but I also think there was some Merit to it even if he was playing into like a heal uh thing and I think there's a mixture and it's not black and white you're right Jimmy Fallon can be a scumbag and also In This Moment be over analyzed to a point where it's like people are hating on him for a reason that he doesn't deserve look this all started when that when that white woman explained why Monster Energy worships the devil it's the same thing and I think that stuff's cool that's different that's I was going to say that's different because that's not a human no CU it's like hey look at the signs that's real when you could just know you could just be like that's real yeah it is it is and we believe that around here white monster what is this Aiden in Sweden let's go dude nice also maybe this may me think also on this what your print's looking a little

[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Christ you're trying I got I got the Sarah Bonito follow from posting my pink switch that's all I got not to say that's a that's why I was wondering what the connection was but I'm I'm very excited cuz she's that's awesome I love her music they like the one that goes me too and also her DJ sets are insane so we both we both connected DJ head not really just her I thought you listen to Andrea uh I've never listened to Andrea I sent Andrea Sarah bonito mix and I was like you should check this out that's so funny you did that why cuz it was like the one connection it was like it was just more like no it was this was a while ago when I first heard the mix I was just like this is sick I don't know if you would [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with this but I know this is what you're into I was like Grandpa at the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] table yeah that's do you like this it's the video game thing yeah okay we made it an hour anyway so I'm play jungle now God and jungle's sick cuz you can control the game my macro sense is already developed from a lot of DOTA it's way easier than top you lose the lane it kind of sucks you got the team's got a 44 and there's a great subreddit where people are just discussing strats what's up today and the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah am I the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for using the jungler subreddit to discuss my G am I the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for not taking Smite dude I I was looking up so much stuff and people use the jungler subreddit as like Counter Intelligence yeah it's like top laners being like hey jungle mans I need to learn about fiddle 6 Q passive it says out of combat how long is that and they're just trying to find out so they can beat us I mean it it goes both ways but the junglers are giving up the info it's not a game of hiding information it should be it should you're hbox in it yeah you're I am I am you're H you don't want to play friend that guy second biggest winning streak ever second silver medals are good for you silver very similar to your performance in league if I was the second best ever to do it in League that'd be showed me some people that I would be okay with that you want to be better than faker yeah of course would you be like deaf who's the second best in rookie showmaker I don't know who the second second best of all time have no clue I I couldn't even imagine to tell you chovy anyway I'm about to I'm about to grind I'm about to climb I have a conven what dude hey dude it's okay come to me man what you think we could all play together no that a confession question what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you I'll play with you guys I'll do an in-house we need five who's our fifth our fifth could be anyone Nick yeah this is spot many actually we actually have a good what do you play you would be top uh yeah be top you'd be jungle you'd be support I'm just calling it who do you play or ad don't you play bot no I play probably you have be support or ADC uh I mean of those I mean I could be could support I'd rather play and you go I play I play top jungle in support in that order support why you being mad about it you're being a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I can I can tell because you're slightly bring more impact to the game if you give me a lane man you don't have to be like that F you don't have to be like thatle you have to that's right why don't we do the yard plays league and we play until we lose and that's the only time we'll ever play and if it's one game it it will be what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what is this why are you saying that because it'll take us a while to adjust so the roles will have to fill and I think that one game could just be the bad play a shitload of mid you play shitload of jungle I play shitload of top he is a top mhm don't you understand I know but one person's going to be filling a role they're not used to uh wait what what do you mean what you talking about who's our fifth we don't have an ADC ready to go Shake ADC [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it shake can play whatever yeah Kenny well Shake is a carus one trick Josh could ad you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cruel also Josh and miles get is not it's not booties if it's being I'm not being cruel but they would have one has played so many games he is the rank he is yeah which is plat four also it's not boosties because that's how the match it's just matchmaking it's look at Shake drizzle uh op.gg after look after I hate that guy and you're being if he's on his main account he not booties after 600 games we can safely say he's that rank I don't think I don't think I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] talking crazy here okay yeah call oh you want to say it you say it to his face I'll say it to his face he's plat three he's played so much he's played so what is the amount of games I think he has 600 this season it's it's in the top left holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dude it's those two numbers pick up shake what happened Shake we used beating your ass yeah that that's that's that's 524 games in the past I think three weeks Shake pickup no or maybe sorry month and a half I don't when did is this all of season 14 I didn't know if it was all of 14 or 14 point uh oh that's a bummer he had an innocent that's a toughy innocent's tough um he's a carus one trick great win win right on the carus though you're you have some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nerve to call him a one trick I am blown away I'm not I I look I I don't cast the stone not understanding literally I'm a one trick I shake has played this game for so long shake the Le in he probably has a 20 pool deep champ you know what I meant sure and that he could easily ADC for us and that is not a problem and you're saying we're too good for him kill yourself I think the plat three that we would get in exchange would be giving higher value than we'd be getting out of our plat three unless we put shake mid on carus should we I think that's you're insane do you think we're getting the same value as shak's mid carus yeah I I think it we're same I think it doesn't matter I think I would still like to play with Shake on the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bottom line I'm not saying I would I never said anything about all you were saying is how much you didn't want to no you're dumb I said it might last a gay that's all I said you were that's all I said when the tapes when I brought up Jake you were extremely resilient and started attacking his personal character all I said is it might last a game and I gave reasons why in a tone that was evil I would love guys our mentals already in shambles crazy I personally I would love to play with shake drizzel for 30 minutes that' make me happy I don't think of being crazy I don't need you guys answer anymore you're being extremely I think Shake would do fine I think Josh is obviously the best choice but is but Josh boosts it's boosted animal season why is it boosted animal season I guess oh well for Josh cuz he wouldn't have a main to play on yeah cuz I don't think he has enough games in any account to account for what his act I see that's why you think it's boosted is because he has played very much this season so whatever account he plays on it's going to be new and not reflecting of his rank okay so then we wouldn't get an equal person on there to nothing I said wrong so then miles that would be fine too I don't know why you're so cruel to him I'm not cruel to him you're you're right you're really nice I'd say it all to his face wait you know who plays you know who plays bot Alex smokes M you know who plays a bot the first time I played with Alex in his Bard which is very cute I was like you should Ward over there and he said what's that I would love I would love to play league with Alex for 22 minutes and he drops you a little hot chocolate he's like he's like wait for it to grow to get bigger I was 15 we somehow FF in in Flex CU and everyone's like who did it four of us he's got a heart of gold well do you maybe we rip it tonight maybe we get on tonight I don't I'll do whatever you guys want but it's it already sounds like lwig is pillow princessing and he wants his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] as monkey eaten all night Jesus you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and you're monkey dude you got us working double time God I I I'm happy to play our one game see what I'm saying what if we win it they'll play second so we play till we lose that's how it works and if you throw that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up dark Vibes op.gg will say innocent next to my we might need to do the opposite think you're that nice I'm that nice we we we might need to do uh play until we win yeah yeah I like that better actually okay so if we if we win the first let play till we lose if we lose the first let play till we win yeah that's fine yeah sure this is good mix that is fine it is a it is a good catch let's play tonight dude oh they're going to I don't want to say the Strat the Strat is is snipe us and then ban Lux oh yeah that's brutal getx band Fiddlesticks band we actually we actually have to go we have to go live as we're booting into the game n we should be fun I good top because the thing is you Flex Q you'd have to sniper it's really hard to snipe if they have oh with flex yes so either they're sniping solo Q in a flex and then they're just going to lose cuz they don't have comms or they're a group of friends which is low likelihood I feel like the I guess if it if it guarantees you play another group I think yeah I well I think you can I think it always guarantees like at least one group is of three or something and then it can be two solo Fields do you only play jungle yeah you know uh you know bonfire she was telling me cuz she she was play like a shitload of league and she's like in college we had like a a college um League of Legends like League basically and she she was like three people on the other team for the other college didn't show up or or sorry two people on her team didn't show up and they're like let's just play the 3v5 did they win it and they won dude no like I'm like you're a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] gamer and she's like yeah [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] game holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah also con con told a story at world's greatest where he had a a same thing a college like 5v5 match that he had with another school other guy on the team little name of box box whoa yeah he got destroyed yeah he was a Riven one trick top he was crazy this this was in like the 60s it was in the 60s yeah dude okay no he's very young Tony Albert yeah for like how OG he is cuz I think he has been a creator for over 10 years and I think he's younger than me you look at boxbox age that's crazy he was making videos when I was like in high school he was a high schooler that's the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] trick dude if box is younger than you 28 he's younger than me he's born in 96 that's awesome and he's been doing content like twice as long as me God it's the squeaker diff squeaker diff he ain't no damn squeaker that's what I'm saying squeaker diff I got I guess non squeaker diff maybe then who the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is the squeaker in this squeers are like when you sound younger when you're young yeah you can't make is aescent teen and he sounded like not a squeaker so this the diff is him and all other squeakers comparing them to you I'm the squeaker you're yeah I'm getting died cuz my voice sounded worse yeah you didn't hit You're Nobody wants to listen to little kid your little ass monkey didn't drop till I'm not liking monkey I'm not I like when he says it like that cuz what is it his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] didn't drop yeah is that what he saying your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] drops and then you become a woman yeah right yeah it's an anatomy thing I haven't learned it personally I watch video grade they separated the girls and the boys I remember Fallopian tubes yeah it's part of the monkey that's part of the monkey part of the monkey a lot of different parts in the monkey uh it's it's we've never found it's a blessing you never there's some that some parts that monkey we still have mystery I would love to see you as a substitute teacher i''d be awesome I feel like you would dude you'd be so mad at students dude you get so mad because I'd only be there for a day I think that what gets me pissed is having to deal with it day in day out I show for a day I am not committed to these kids right like no but I don't think this holds up I think like like for example guy we met in Japan that you hated this is a temporary guy you will not see remember that guy but you you went zero to 100 he pissed you off that's different cuz I didn't expect it huh what he do remember that we would I don't know how much don't elaborate uh leave me and I think it's different it's also like if I do a a stream where I know that I'm supposed to be a Clowny type of guy like when I go on J and stream J I'm ready to take [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I've been really good the last time and so there is a mental bracket we used to sit together and he would lean over me like that one [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] picture of the guys in the studio young except it would be him to ban someone yeah every time it'd be to ban and he'd scroll up and find it and be like okay and it's like like commercial break so I what I would what I'm saying is I was a teacher I would have gum surgery and I'd mess up my words and I would be ready to handle that the Goon Professor I think it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] really hard all right everyone welcome to class goon 101 we're go a lot of simple Concepts in this class no goon 401 you'll notice there are smartboards on every wall we have actuallyy smartboards forious purposes we went to a lunch for my grandpa's 91st birthday oh my God God bless him God BL 90 90 whole ass one he's he's losing a bit of memory okay he's se's my sister he's not sure who she is no we he plays dominoes with my cousin's friend Pedro comes over they play dominoes like I don't know maybe once every month or twice uh a

like true he's like doesn't drink I'm like this is all true this all true and then and then he just goes and then backs off I'm like okay all right this was uh this was close this was close we teetered on the edge that's crazy yeah we ni moment though he cried what when why he saying happy birthday and he just started crying oh during happy birthday during happy birthday he's probably thinking about yeah I think so he was like he was like we'll count all the way up to 100 then we stopped counting I'm like sure I'm down for that what does that mean like count birthdays cuz it was like the 91st birthday they had the candles oh we'll count the candles all the way up to 100 and stop counting I was like all right bet 91's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] run man it is crazy he has he was never

become like cuz the way you have to take care of a 91y old is similar to a child but with different rules yeah they can drink they can drink but you water down the wine oh you got to water down the wine interesting you're not feeding that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] not I just just give them OJ they're like yummy it's something it's a screwdriver I promise yummy he's like okay dude little at this at this tailgate I went to they they had a uh I don't know just like hot drink what do you call the things that you push like tea or coffee out of French Press you push them out of no like you you would bring them a thermos one of the giant thermos thermos and I'm I go up I I'm like I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] freezing I'm from California now I'm not built for this I pushed you know oh nice hot chocolate oh the you mean like the decer thingies that have like the silver yeah yeah and I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm sipping my hot chocolate and I'm like no it's mint hot chocolate it's really nice it's like it's like a little like it's like really minty though and then I'm drinking I drink I'm cold I drink like three full cups of this you got to put back that mint and then and then I go I tell zipper 3 and her friend that I've been drinking this to keep warm it's like it's got a lot of whiskey in it I've just been sending chocolate chocolate the whole time I thought it was minty that I mean that's a good mix if you couldn't tell that's a good ass mix you were drunk as hell was getting drunk in the tailgate dude that's but I didn't know I was getting drunk grilling up sausage getting [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] drunk in the parking lot bro that's keep that was an anthropological experience I was dapping up people left and right dude was your team H who's your team in this the birds okay they go birds so I'm sorry it's the Ravens versus is the Eagles so they're both Birds they go Birds I'm just a fan All Birds Go all birds anyone flies I'm four that's awesome St there no no I was hoping I would just like stumble into it maybe but he loves it he Lov them damn Ravens he's a big he's a big they're good too they're good Eagles are better they lost the Eagles won wait was mango there a lot of misinformation going on I don't know what to believe they're they're super bowl b didn't get a Baltimore why not e [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] eagles they look amazing yeah oh my God I'm so happy for mango yeah it's a big year for mango he's happy about this oh my God it's good yeah they're coming Rivals 2 patch drops what in two days uh December 3rd yeah yeah we'll see what happens we need a Eagles raster skin now d i I pulled mango when we were playing those friendlies I didn't pull them aside we were already aside but I kind of like leaned in I was like you think these Rivals players are good at their own game and he goes they're all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I knew we'd say that I just wanted to hear him all the melee players have this entitlement to be good that is just so funny it's bad they're losing it is bad and that's like all that matters is that they're losing they're just losing the facts are that the rivals players win the tournament said M said give us six months give six the only person who can maybe trip a bit is like what left have the best performance right good but even that performance isn't enough PL but he didn't even chirp think lein is the trips on the low sure like a like a smart guy yeah he trips respectfully lein is quite good yeah but lein is the one who triped the most and also got beat yeah but the thing with I know people don't like the chirping but he's the guy who in my mind he kind of gets to do it how many G I'm sorry how many evos have you guys won I a left and apologist as well but the way he talks about Craig is might as well be like he [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] punch his mom in the face it's like bro just I'm not saying it's good I'm not saying it's productive it's and that's that's not not it isn't close productive and that's what it is but then he comes out and he if he wins an event he can [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] as much as he wants he you have to third place is not enough yeah I think it's funny too when lein starts talking [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on a game you really like you really are like okay I get why people get really mad at him like the way he talks about Tekken I'm like dude relax like Tekken didn't do anything I can't imagine being a Guilty Gear fan knowing of Le and then he comes to your game he starts bitching about characters you're like this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] guy and then he wins Evo and you're just like it's so funny that he won bad ass and then he's just like I'm out yeah he's wearing those those awesome mom jeans that's why dud that's why when he beat when he beat Salem it was just like you can't that was hardore you can't lose Like a Villain after all that it was awesome so that's the that's what we get you know that's the package of lein and you know he's sweet and then he's sour he's like a damn one of them taffies I I think the same thing happens in Reverse though the rivals players have been getting mad at the melee players or just smash players like disproportionately like so it was two days ago someone's getting lit up cuz there was some event and it it was hungry boxes coin box and it listed like notable players and then someone quote retweeted it and they're like oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] putting Larry lur over me and then everyone's just like brother here's the resume I I to that people you know that picture of him standing in the kitchen in his hoodie people just spamming that photo and is like talking [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on the legend that was one of hugs' greatest Halloween costumes with outfit uh yeah it like I know I know Larry lur you said that and I immediately thought of him wearing the Mega Man shirt and I'm like that's just the game so I don't know what to tell you and he was good at melee yeah he's aess gamer they just it's like uh we had this when I went to high school it was two middle schools combining oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in the first few months it was like you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with the other side well in Degrassi someone died on that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the two schools combining yeah that's right Lake Hurst and Degrassi combined guess who got [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] wet up JT yeah he got stabbed all and Brookline combined guess who got jerked off on the ski bus black guy not me no I would have been sick it was another it was another guy damn it's awesome get a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] beat is that awesome that's fire yeah that's tight that's tight he got a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Lo he's not a landlord landlord he's not a landlord he's actually no sorry you're right you're right he's a he's not that either that is just a different word for a landlord no his he
