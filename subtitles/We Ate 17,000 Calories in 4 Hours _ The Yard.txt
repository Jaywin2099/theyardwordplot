 Yeah, he's already &gt;&gt; my ies [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] light him up. &gt;&gt; I saw him in half. &gt;&gt; Sleepy little baby. He sleeps so good. &gt;&gt; And he's so Oh, look at him wake up so demure. [Music] &gt;&gt; Okay. Do you want to give me a little bite of that? Oh man. &gt;&gt; You want to give me a little? &gt;&gt; I feel Dude, I can't believe you guys can even eat. &gt;&gt; I feel gross right now. &gt;&gt; Dude, I'm so hungry. &gt;&gt; I didn't eat today. &gt;&gt; Oh, I was just like, I I'm not going to eat today. &gt;&gt; You [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] didn't throw up into the bush near the crispy cream. &gt;&gt; Great. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I threw up into a bush and now today I'm starving and I feel awesome. &gt;&gt; I can't express how important it is when you throw up &gt;&gt; after every meal. &gt;&gt; It just you become skinty. Yeah. No, but like you I You can't see the world the way we see it. &gt;&gt; I went home and I felt like $1 million. &gt;&gt; I went to a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Tommy's on the way home. &gt;&gt; Oh, you got a butt diaper sandwich. &gt;&gt; Tommy's Tommy's is a crime. &gt;&gt; He's a crime. &gt;&gt; No one saw this. I cheated on stream. I I put the last bite of the Tommy's burger in my pocket &gt;&gt; and then when I got home, I actually lowkey was like, I kind of want it and I ate it in my bed. &gt;&gt; Are you kidding? &gt;&gt; Of course I didn't do any of this. No. What the hell are you doing? I don't even know, &gt;&gt; dude. Just pulling the Tommy's Burger out your pocket. &gt;&gt; I was explaining I was explaining to Zipper 3 what Tommy's was cuz she had never heard of it. And I was explaining like Slime described it perfectly in that it's just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in a rapper. And then she was like, "It can't be that bad." And she looked up Tommy's on Yelp. &gt;&gt; The first the best photo of Tommy's on Yelp is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in a rapper. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's the best photo they have. Yeah. So, I know this is really dumb to say, but something a realization I had like laying in bed the night after was like we weren't just eating random food. We were eating people's go-to orders. &gt;&gt; And that &gt;&gt; that's what I was thinking about. &gt;&gt; That [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me up, &gt;&gt; dude. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I thought about that a lot last night. &gt;&gt; That is so g If you &gt;&gt; It's just chilly. God, you guys. &gt;&gt; I know. But it looks like it was going to gain the ability to speak. If you dude, if you think about it really hard as poop and you don't let that escape your mind, that is disgusting. &gt;&gt; Hey, dude. What? &gt;&gt; I'm looking at it on the rapper. &gt;&gt; Dude, it actually I'm not kidding. They actually &gt;&gt; They're consistent with how Go back to the picture. They're consistent with how weird their pickles are. &gt;&gt; Dude, their pickles are so pickles were nasty. &gt;&gt; I was so excited cuz I love pickles and it was like extra pickles. I'll eat the pickles off for you, Nick, because you don't like pickles. The little baby boy doesn't like his pickles. &gt;&gt; He's picky. &gt;&gt; Okay. guy who gags at a sandwich. Dude, you gagged at us eating it. &gt;&gt; You gagged at a sight of a diaper, &gt;&gt; dude. Oh, it looks like it looks like the inside of a diaper. &gt;&gt; Dude, it's covered in baby poop. &gt;&gt; Dude, look at the bottom. Why is the bottom all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stained? &gt;&gt; Dude, that is so actually kind of looks good. &gt;&gt; Dude, if you go to Tommy's, if you're listening to this and you go to Tommy's, it's it's time to pack it up. &gt;&gt; So, in Aiden's world Oh, that that they need to be sued. Dude, &gt;&gt; that is that is it's crazy. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Do you want do you want uh diarrhea and or do you want poop? &gt;&gt; Also so funny at Tommy's was when we when Lwig he said Aiden you need to restore the vibe. So I get out of the car. I'm trying to do the swift humping motion and then Nick gets out to to correctly do it. And then as we're doing the swift humping on the car, Lewig just yells. He's like, "This man's about to be a father." &gt;&gt; And then the guy in the car next to us who was just parked in the parking lot about 30 seconds later, he rolls up and rolls his window down. I'm standing in the Tommy's parking lot with my elf ears and elf hat and he looks at me and he's like, "Congratulations, man." And I'm like, "What?" And he's like, "You're well, you're about to be a dad." And I was like, "I'm sorry, man. No, I'm not." you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] keep it going. &gt;&gt; It's crazy to not just be like, "Yeah, &gt;&gt; I hate lying to strangers like that." &gt;&gt; No, lying is awesome. &gt;&gt; For that stranger, I think it's a better night if he felt good congratulating than if he was like got duped. &gt;&gt; Well, he he said he looked at me. He was like, "Oh, your friend was just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] around." And he was laughing. I was like, "Yeah." And he's like, "And then &gt;&gt; guy in a Tommy's parking lot." He looked &gt;&gt; eating his sandwich. He looked like the best thing that's ever happened to him something. He was kind of he gave me a look in reaction that it felt like he and his boys growing up in the were also [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] around. &gt;&gt; The joy the joy of that moment he probably ordered that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] disgusting chili burger, looked at it and been like not tonight. &gt;&gt; I don't actually chili just looked like that. &gt;&gt; I think Tommy's is gross. But if you guys are being my chili makes chili, you can see the ingredients in chili when it's good chili. &gt;&gt; That's the point. You can see the pinto bean. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; you can see the onion. &gt;&gt; I actually don't know what chili really is. It's kind of just chili to me. You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you talking word? &gt;&gt; If I was a master chef and they were like make chili. I'd be like, &gt;&gt; you know, &gt;&gt; do I just make beans? &gt;&gt; When he you know when he rolled up and he was like, isn't it like how did how did the batteries we don't even get how the batteries work? That's how I feel about chili. You You know what's crazy is because we talked about your Nile Red impression where we were just DMing and then you sent me a video of him cutting the battery open and uh I was like I've never seen the inside of a battery and I feel like you should have like you shouldn't be curious about batteries because you've seen him use the battery. &gt;&gt; That's beauty. They're like computers, man. Like the more people explain it to me, the further I get from understanding. That's true. &gt;&gt; So he unrolled it and then it exploded and he got more confused. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, I actually with that example, I only listened to the first second cuz I was like, "Oh, it's his voice that's in it." Correct. &gt;&gt; You didn't watch the whole thing? &gt;&gt; No, I just sentenced you cuz I knew it sounded like him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh Tommy's is funny because so I I live I used to live near that Tommy's which is so I kind of knew where we were and I was like Tommy's is a place &gt;&gt; so you're evil. &gt;&gt; I evil because you're the one who earlier in the ride goes dude if we run by a Tom is going to suck. &gt;&gt; This restaurant you guys haven't heard of. &gt;&gt; And then you're like And then you're like what if we get on the 101 and exit on Vine Street? Oh my god, there's a Tommy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, I I kind of I didn't plan I didn't I wasn't like trying to find the Tommy's, but what I did, I knew that neighborhood. I was like, I've been here before. I know what's around, you know, &gt;&gt; including the diaper planet and and then we landed on it and Yeah. &gt;&gt; Have you gone to Tommy's and done that? &gt;&gt; Oh, a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] chili. &gt;&gt; No, I think I've got it like twice in my life. When I used to live near there, I was like, "Oh, I'm hungry." Got Tommy's. I was like, "This is insane." And then I think I got it again and I never did again. But I never forgot that's the the the mark made on my brain because I was like it looks like a butt and then you know what 7 years later. &gt;&gt; Well, what's crazy is you know you know the theory that you forget pain. You don't remember what pain feels like. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You never forget what a Tommy burger tastes like. &gt;&gt; No, it tastes like metal. &gt;&gt; Like the pickles tasted like really metal. &gt;&gt; The pickles I got to find the guy who makes them cuz he must be calling it a special sauce. &gt;&gt; Something happened. &gt;&gt; A brine that you've never seen. There's so many places in California, I think just in the United States in general, that are named after a guy. It'll be like Tom's, Tommy's, Johnny's, and I feel like they all follow the same arc where it's like they they open whatever, success or not, whatever. &gt;&gt; They open in like racist America. &gt;&gt; They open in racist America, they expand, and then eventually they their customer base goes down and down. They start to cheapen the ingredients to make up for the loss in income. And then they end up in this weird equilibrium of like people who can afford that food, but also the cost to make it is so low that it's just garbage. And there they are. And they're there forever and they never go away. &gt;&gt; You're talking about fast food. That's what &gt;&gt; No, no, no. And Carl Jr. innovators. &gt;&gt; They got hot girls on the menu. &gt;&gt; What the What? How are &gt;&gt; money? They had to pay for the rights to use that picture. &gt;&gt; But they're still instead of putting money into making their food as good as possible, putting it into marketing. &gt;&gt; You're telling me that Taco Bell is not innovating their food constantly. &gt;&gt; Taco Bell is innovator. &gt;&gt; They are. This is my point. They are. And they're at the top of the money food. There's a genre of burger chain like Tommy's. There's more tomies out there that exist in &gt;&gt; So, let's also back up. Taco Bell also innovated to discover that you could find worms that could eat meat and then resemble the taste of meat and then put that in the burger instead of meat. &gt;&gt; They did this. Is it real? &gt;&gt; I think it worked. &gt;&gt; Getting there is half the battle. And I don't fault companies for doing beautiful science for like that. But the science is like, how do we find a way to make it taste good but make it cheap in like actual dog manure? &gt;&gt; I have an idea for food scientists. You ready for this? I They should pick me up. So instead of pickles, right, we grow the pickle man &gt;&gt; and instead of one pickle, it's five like prongs &gt;&gt; and you basically five pickles for one. &gt;&gt; It's and it looks like a little man with arms and legs and a head and he's the pickle man. And you cut up. Well, the thing is you don't know. Well, Pickleman's Gourmet Cafe. Well, &gt;&gt; no, no, no. You &gt;&gt; It's been done. &gt;&gt; You know what I'm saying? It's a little man. &gt;&gt; I actually I really just don't know what you're saying. Are you saying that &gt;&gt; you're just attaching pickles in the shape of a man and you buy that and eat it? &gt;&gt; Is it the novelty more yield? You don't You don't see the higher yield pickles. &gt;&gt; This is not the pickle. &gt;&gt; So, you grow the pickle man in the field and then you chop. &gt;&gt; I think he thinks if you put five pickles in the shape of a man into the dirt, a pickle man will more pickle. It will duplicate like a tears of the kingdom duplication. Listen, the pickle that that comes to you as the end user is iniccernible from normal pickles, &gt;&gt; but we've cut it on five finger pickle &gt;&gt; and the yield is higher. &gt;&gt; We're in the first five minutes of a writer's room that ended up at pickle Rick. &gt;&gt; We're in the very beginning of that room where we're like, that's not it. But it is funny. It's funny. You get a higher yield and you get you get 5x the yield and it's called the pickle man. We just grow pickles. &gt;&gt; I think man [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] also that's not how you make pickles. &gt;&gt; You see in the cucumbers we get c We're actually going to cucumber. &gt;&gt; We're actually growing a cucumber pickle pickle. The whole point of pickles is they're pickled. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You put it in the the white powerade. &gt;&gt; Can we just grow them? &gt;&gt; No. Why not? Cuz they're pickled. Pickle them in the ground. &gt;&gt; Pickles are cucumbers that have been pickled. To be pickled is a state. &gt;&gt; But pickle man can solve this. I feel like if they have a sentence, maybe Chachi B can get involved in this. If they have like a sentience, they can decide to pickle before they become a man. &gt;&gt; If we start to kill the pickle man and he's like can think, then we're getting bad. &gt;&gt; Then we get into a world. I don't like that. &gt;&gt; But what if the pickle man, he's higher yield, so is it ethical to kill him? Well, &gt;&gt; if I mean, if the yield's really high and he screams just a little bit, &gt;&gt; just a little bit. Maybe we electrocute him in the head like we do to cows &gt;&gt; and then cut the pickle. &gt;&gt; Tastes better if you if you cut it you start to cut the pickle man while he's still alive. Kind of like when you boil the lobster alive, you know. &gt;&gt; Is there is does the existence of a pickle man imply the existence of a pickle woman? &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; Great question. I mean to all plants, you know, they have to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; No, that's just not true. That's true. &gt;&gt; That's just not true, &gt;&gt; dude. This &gt;&gt; all plants don't have to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Oh my god. too. It was my uncle's friend when I was a little kid. He was telling me how how you make marijuana. It was like I tell you how it works that you take the bud and it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the plant. I'm not kidding. He told me his name was Jimmy. He said it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the plant and then the plant gets [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and then it grows the flower. You hang it upside down. You dry it out. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that but a Nile red voice &gt;&gt; and an explainer video of how to make DR. Man, the plants [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in front of me. &gt;&gt; I can't do like &gt;&gt; You guys know what a wedge salad is? &gt;&gt; Um, yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Is that Is that common? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I've seen I've seen a wedge salad on a few menus. &gt;&gt; What makes it a wedge salad? &gt;&gt; I think it's it's made with wedge salad. &gt;&gt; What is it? What is it? &gt;&gt; Describe it to liberal with a non-answer. &gt;&gt; It's very Okay, if I'm thinking of a wedge salad, it's like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] It looks just like a chunk of lettuce, &gt;&gt; but it's like No, it's literally wedge shaped, isn't it? Like there's like wedges inside of it &gt;&gt; and then they they put some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in the middle of the chunk before for sure. &gt;&gt; I want to see it. Zebra, can you show me what a wedge salad looks like? &gt;&gt; Just like images. &gt;&gt; Um &gt;&gt; yeah, it's big [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fat chunk. &gt;&gt; Okay. Are these common though? Is this like a normal thing? &gt;&gt; It's like a watermelon salad. Is this a normal thing at um they do this at Kismmet Rotisserie? &gt;&gt; Uh yes, they do. &gt;&gt; That's exactly where they do it, Nick. &gt;&gt; Yep. And I saw it on the menu and I had one &gt;&gt; and it's covered in a thick cream &gt;&gt; and my girlfriend a thick cream &gt;&gt; made me feel like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for not knowing what it was. I've never eaten one of these before. I didn't know it existed. &gt;&gt; It's It's as like common I think as a Cobb. &gt;&gt; Do you know what a cob salad is? &gt;&gt; A cob salad is way more salad. &gt;&gt; Do you know what a Cobb salad? Cobad comes with a gun. &gt;&gt; Salads count. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And and the tail of a dog. &gt;&gt; No, bro. It's it's it's just a format of a salad that is very small variation. &gt;&gt; What's a Cobb salad? &gt;&gt; I think it's lazy. &gt;&gt; What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you talking about? Cobb salad. You've never had Cobb salad. &gt;&gt; Salad. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; So, they put it in layers. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that. &gt;&gt; I mean, it's just a salad. &gt;&gt; Caesar salad. Salad. Everyone knows a house salad. Everyone knows. &gt;&gt; I hate that we have to toss salad. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I didn't ask to go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] order a salad. I don't want to make the food. Make the food. I bought the food. Make the food. So what would you prefer? That it comes &gt;&gt; it comes pre-toires. You would want you would have wanted to be pre money. I want I want to enjoy the tossing when you do it. &gt;&gt; But this I I worked I've maybe said this on the P before. I worked at a restaurant. I was a buser and this old woman was a waitress and everyone hated her. She was so mean and annoying. But she in this like Brooklyn voice she'd be like, "So what do you want for a side? We got sour dough. Toss salad." &gt;&gt; But like the salad wasn't that. It was just the salad. She just made sure to say it like that and it sounded like she was going to eat your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Maybe she had a bit of enjoyment. &gt;&gt; I don't I don't think she was &gt;&gt; Maybe someone took her up on it. &gt;&gt; Dude, if someone did to the went to the bathroom with her and that would have been that would have been great. &gt;&gt; I thought she sell your shoes. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Why did you delace your shoes? [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; I used them to tie down a tent in Japan with Michael. &gt;&gt; You're That is cool. That is the coolest reason you could have said. &gt;&gt; You kept wearing them. I wanted to make fun of your show and then and then I couldn't make fun of MacGyver son. &gt;&gt; I wanted you to call I wanted to call you I was queuing up to call you a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I couldn't. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Just shaking ready to call you that. &gt;&gt; Am I fits the best in the room. Uh-oh. Did it again. &gt;&gt; I'm the widest in the room. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Back up. &gt;&gt; You've been getting better. &gt;&gt; You're dressed like Ellen. &gt;&gt; Zipper. You're laughing a little hard there. But &gt;&gt; you do look like Ellen right now. Can I be a 35-year-old for a second? To have seen the the fall the rise fall and rise again of baggy jeans makes me uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; Why is that? &gt;&gt; Because at one point it was cool and then at one point it was supremely not cool and now it's cool again. &gt;&gt; And guess what happened? &gt;&gt; And I don't like that idea that it's like, well, everyone just forgot that it was uncool. &gt;&gt; You know, I actually strangely don't feel like it was ever not cool. I just think skinny jeans were cooler. I think baggy pants always work. &gt;&gt; I I disagree. I think when you wore baggy pants, &gt;&gt; cargo pants became lame &gt;&gt; out the door. I disagree. Like if you wore &gt;&gt; definitely became lame. &gt;&gt; They did. But what I'm saying is like that's that's apples and oranges. When you wore Jenkos when they were in it's like 2010. People like what are you doing? &gt;&gt; Jenkos are a different thing. Okay. But are cargo pants back? Cuz you're kind of wearing these are cargo jeans. &gt;&gt; Caros. They got they got cargo pockets. &gt;&gt; I feel like caros are bad. &gt;&gt; I use all of them. &gt;&gt; You use all them. I use all you. &gt;&gt; It's my geek bar. It's my sigs. That's my pen. &gt;&gt; That's cool, man. &gt;&gt; How am I supposed to reconcile this this feeling I have? &gt;&gt; Um, kill yourself. &gt;&gt; Okay, you can dress. &gt;&gt; I think I think I I I feel what you feel, but but I'm resolute in the sense that &gt;&gt; cuz you're like buying into it. You're wearing cuz you think this looks good, but I'm just wearing what's comfortable. &gt;&gt; I'm a supreme hater of skinny pants. Always have been &gt;&gt; cuz I my thighs don't fit. &gt;&gt; You are expressly not just wearing what's comfortable. You are buying a lot of t-shirts that make you laugh. You don't know how they will feel when you buy them. &gt;&gt; Oh, me? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, I guess I don't feel uncomfortable in t-shirts and unless it's very rare. &gt;&gt; Yo, you're not buying You're not buying You're not like going like, "Oh, I I like Uniqlo. I'm going to go buy a shirt there." It's like, "Oh, that shirt has uh Minute made on it. I'm going to buy it." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh, I'm But what I'm saying is I think baggie jeans were something I was never interested in in the first place. So I don't get this this resurrection of interest &gt;&gt; because they I think baggy jeans are a comfort first denim. You have a lot of movement. They're not restricting. And now that they're in style, it's like, oh, they're comfortable and I can be comfort and they're in style. &gt;&gt; That's where I'm at. &gt;&gt; When the skinny [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] was in style wouldn't work with me. &gt;&gt; I couldn't fit. I would be busting out. I just always wore clothes that fit. I don't know. It's like I'm not I'm not trying to look down. I'm not trying to &gt;&gt; Let me understand where you're coming from. Are you saying you don't understand trends or what are you saying? &gt;&gt; I'm saying that the trends they &gt;&gt; we have baggy jeans went out of style and now they're back &gt;&gt; and now Lewig is wearing them and now you bought a lot too and like these aren't baggy but you have bigger baggier ones and so did he. And it's like I see insta I see these people buying the things that is stylish when like the pants that sort of just fit us the whole time were always there. &gt;&gt; So do you think people should be like let's take an example C dog va &gt;&gt; I think what you're missing is that uh people will decide what to wear in part by what they are confident in. And I think that your confidence is defined by like you like shirts that are tighter. you don't like how shirts feel or look when they're baggy on you, right? P. Some people just feel the opposite &gt;&gt; where they're like their confidence can be defined by culture and trends as well. Like, oh, these jeans maybe normally would be a conversation starter I don't want cuz they're not in style. And people would be like, what are you wearing? But now that they're in style, I can confidently wear them and I like them. &gt;&gt; Do you think Adapt went through all of that when he picked his giant baggie jeans? &gt;&gt; I think he went, "Those are trill. I'm going to buy those." &gt;&gt; Oh, that's what he said. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I think he was in the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] store. is like these are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] awesome. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; I don't think Adab thought about this for more than 5 seconds. &gt;&gt; I disagree. I I think he looks he's looking at jeans and he's like what won't make me look like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] or something. &gt;&gt; No, I feel like he looks at jeans and he's just like those jeans are tight. Those jeans are trill. &gt;&gt; He probably cares about he probably cares about brands and price tags and stuff. &gt;&gt; He seems like just a confident man who knows what he wants. &gt;&gt; I think he would want to dress. &gt;&gt; He dresses like Eric Repid. Like he dresses pretty simply. He's got a black tank and jeans, &gt;&gt; but he wear he the specific jeans he wears are the big ass like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] big jean. &gt;&gt; Are they that big? &gt;&gt; They're huge. I saw that cutest concert. &gt;&gt; I don't look enough at his C dog VA example. &gt;&gt; Well, I was going to say, are you saying that we should be like him? Cuz Connor is almost militaristic in his outfits. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he he wears a uniform. &gt;&gt; Oh, right. He wears his purple shirt &gt;&gt; and for his birthday, he literally tweeted out, "Got more shirts for my birthday." &gt;&gt; Like nine more of them. cuz I wore the same shirt and he always wears his baggy zipper. Can you pull up Conor's Twitter? C Dog VA Twitter. He he he literally, you know, that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] two block purple white trash taste shirt that he wears. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; he bought like 10 more for his birthday. &gt;&gt; Look, this is my view on outfits. &gt;&gt; His trash taste shirt he bought for himself for his birthday. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Or got them, bought them, whatever. Get over the butt for But I'm just saying for his birthday, he literally posted a picture of himself with like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 10 more. He's like ready for the year. &gt;&gt; This is what I think about about outfits. So like you can't not everyone can have the same haircut, right? A different a decent part of what makes a haircut look good on your head. Yeah. What a freak, man. &gt;&gt; That's awesome. &gt;&gt; That is crazy. &gt;&gt; But okay, so it is awesome. &gt;&gt; It's awesome cuz it's funny. &gt;&gt; It's Connor Dog VA holding 1 2 3 4 5 six seven different shirts. And also one he's wearing and those are new. You don't know what how many are in his closet. &gt;&gt; Uh really good hair stylist will be like, "Yeah, you don't have the head shape for that cut." &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; And it's like, "Oh, what's that mean?" Well, it's like, well, if your head's more of an oval, then it's like you want certain types of length because we all have these like we can't, most people can't define what it is, but we can see a shape and be like, that feels weird. There's an imbalance in what's going on with you. And I look at outfits in silhouettes, too, where I'm like, oh, some people's body shape, you know, an outfit that I would wear and an outfit that uh I don't know, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Stavos would wear would look different. And so, I think the silhouette of the outfit &gt;&gt; uh because he's bigger. What? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I saw you all as the same size, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I don't really see the world the way you see. &gt;&gt; So, like, you know, I think that like some body types, especially if you're tall, uh you can pull off certain silhouettes that like shorter people look worse in or or the reverse or &gt;&gt; I guess I was always taught and I'm not poo pooing fashion. I think fashion's fine and I I don't look down on it, but I was always taught wear clothes that fit you. &gt;&gt; And I feel like pants like this don't fit your body. They're meant to be so big that they don't. &gt;&gt; You're acting like I'm going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] take flight. &gt;&gt; The way you're saying fit has is you're saying fits every diameter of your body cuz those fit his waist. &gt;&gt; Could you run in these? &gt;&gt; Uh be weird. Is that the barometer? &gt;&gt; It also be better. You can run better in those than you do skinnier jeans. &gt;&gt; I think that's also bad. Right. So this is a &gt;&gt; No, skinnier. I mean, like, even if they were just like &gt;&gt; So, do you think the ultimate outfit is the one that you would have the best chance running in? &gt;&gt; Actually, I like this. This is a good barometer. The best outfits are the ones that you can run the fastest in. &gt;&gt; Oh, low key. I mean, sometimes we need to run. &gt;&gt; So, like, should we have track spikes and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Everyone should credit. He's wearing like joggers and running shoes. &gt;&gt; I know he that &gt;&gt; I'm realizing he has an idea in his head that like clothes are a functional tool for survival. that like if if it if you couldn't survive a fight or a war, then why are you running? &gt;&gt; This is this is a thing to think about. &gt;&gt; How how I engaged with fashion in seventh grade? Like can I run in this outfit? I think that's a real question. I don't think I &gt;&gt; Let me ask a question. Why do you wear a hat? &gt;&gt; Well, cuz I I have to protect my head cuz it's good. &gt;&gt; He has a real I thought about this. He has real utility for why he wears the hat. &gt;&gt; What about you just go sunscreen? I mean, &gt;&gt; yeah, but you have to keep re-uping. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't want to do that. &gt;&gt; This also protects the eyes and the forehead. Let Let me get a followup. Do you prefer the jackets that have the zip- off hood? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; They are more utility. &gt;&gt; Please. Okay. Well, when I was a little kid, I did think the uh the cut off shorts that zipped on very sick. I had those. I guess look, I I just I obviously see it a little different. &gt;&gt; What do you Why do you buy funny shirts? Um because it it gets to be like a billboard to where I can non-verbbally say to someone this is what I think is interesting which is what fashion is in general &gt;&gt; right where you &gt;&gt; I'm not confused about fashion you usually but but you are because you're saying why would you wear that if it doesn't fit &gt;&gt; because he won't do it as far as to disrupt the practicality of it. &gt;&gt; I think you don't respect where the the fashion aspect comes from here but you respect this one more. I do, but be it's be because I saw these rise and fall and that's why the &gt;&gt; if I show up in a kimono, would you still rock with me? &gt;&gt; Uh, not you. No. Uh, you know, you no &gt;&gt; kimono. He's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] number one. &gt;&gt; Nick would probably wear one the best. He would have the best sort of selection. &gt;&gt; I didn't have the hair process. &gt;&gt; I acknowledge you. You look so bad in a kimono. I would not. You don't have the You'd look racist in it. &gt;&gt; I think you'd look good. I think you'd look good, but I'd hold contempt for you buying a kimono. &gt;&gt; The same way when you buy the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] $100 sweater. &gt;&gt; I've seen the rise and fall and rise again of ironic t-shirts. &gt;&gt; I think that's an always food. Really? &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; Say something that is intended to make you laugh. It's like It's like a &gt;&gt; I think he's thinking like the Walmart $15$10. &gt;&gt; I think that's a that was a version of it. I think they, you know, like there's a big difference between the like I think personally, I know you got this as a gift from Nut. I think the like I have a gun t-shirt is like that's went that's a joke that we've done before. It's not funny to me anymore. If you see the guy in like the or like the Ethan Klein like weed covered shirt like those aren't funny anymore. &gt;&gt; But there's like certain ironic shirts that have like changed that where they're funny again. Like I think the Dracula Flow t-shirt isn't funny, but I think like the I like your Sonic shirt. Um, &gt;&gt; yeah. I mean, then you're looking at humor as a cyclic goal thing, which does the exact same thing, right? Like jokes that weren't good and then or are good and then they lose it and then they come back. But again, I think Aiden hit it where it's like the utility of the clothing seems to I I just think baggie jeans are just so imposing on us as people. &gt;&gt; I think I can come to a dream outfit that every human could wear on Earth that everybody in this room would be happy with. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; What? Like &gt;&gt; wait climate based. We're going California. &gt;&gt; Le let's just assume California temperament. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Across the globe. &gt;&gt; Let's make the perfect outfit. &gt;&gt; The perfect outfit. &gt;&gt; Zipper. Can you just like pull some images as we talk about it? &gt;&gt; It's going to be a t-shirt and it's and it's just it's just a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Describe the fit. &gt;&gt; It's a It's a white t-shirt &gt;&gt; like this. it like that except it just has Aiden's face on it. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And it's and it's stretched res all the way around &gt;&gt; all the way around the the back. &gt;&gt; Yep. And it says uh pedophile if found shoot. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; And every human &gt;&gt; everyone wears this. &gt;&gt; Everyone every human &gt;&gt; every single person on the planet Earth &gt;&gt; everyone everybody would wear this shirt. And if you don't, then there's a big question of like why not, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's like, do you can we go check your house? &gt;&gt; What do you got hiding in there? &gt;&gt; We Well, let me finish the rest of the outfit. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I haven't got to the pants. &gt;&gt; Well, you've only talked about the shirt. &gt;&gt; Let me get to the Let me get to the rest of the outfit. &gt;&gt; So far, I feel like I disagree. I feel like the rest of the outfit is not going to pull me in. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Let me watch half the movie and then turn it off. &gt;&gt; I think I'm going to I think I'm going to get you on this next part. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you're going to pull me in. &gt;&gt; Some fits work when they're counterbalanced by the pants. So, let's hear out what he has to say. &gt;&gt; Uh, the pants &gt;&gt; is uh just like a basic ass [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pair of jeans. &gt;&gt; So, yeah, just some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; just regular ass like classic like Levis Levis like like like old school Levis color. &gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] blue jeans, but it's like still the same shirt. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But you have a jacket, too. &gt;&gt; Uh, what else? Okay. What are you going socks? You going short long jacket? &gt;&gt; I'm going midcfe socks. Mid calfe like soccer player almost &gt;&gt; like Well, this is midcfe. No, &gt;&gt; that's like Oh, that's not mid calf. It's like below the calf. &gt;&gt; It is below the calf. &gt;&gt; Wait, this is the calf. &gt;&gt; Yeah, where's the middle? This is no calf. &gt;&gt; Point the middle of your calf. Point to the middle of your calf. I would say the middle of my calf's right here. &gt;&gt; Right. Where are the socks? &gt;&gt; Well, I But the middle of your calf act like these aren't midcfe socks. I can pull them up. &gt;&gt; Okay, those are midfcks. Now, they're midcfe socks. &gt;&gt; I don't wear them like you pull them up. &gt;&gt; Take a bite out of crown. &gt;&gt; I don't wear them like this. Knee high crew. Okay, let's use this one. Um, so you're saying crew crew socks? &gt;&gt; Yeah, these are crew socks. &gt;&gt; Okay, crew socks. &gt;&gt; Why? Why? Why are you fighting me on these midcfe? &gt;&gt; He wants to argue about everything. &gt;&gt; Okay, he agreed they were low calf until you pulled him up, by the way. Just I don't know where he's coming from. &gt;&gt; Science is evidence. &gt;&gt; Um, true. Uh, okay. So, and then shoes. &gt;&gt; Um, flip flops. Thong flip flops. &gt;&gt; Oh, you lost me, bro. &gt;&gt; Black. &gt;&gt; That's where he loses you. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. What if we step in a puddle? And on the thong part, everyone has &gt;&gt; And on the thong part, it has the Japanese flag. &gt;&gt; Okay, you're getting me back. But still, the puddle, &gt;&gt; well, dude, it's a drought &gt;&gt; and a hat that says read the shirt. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's awesome. &gt;&gt; I don't like the outfit. &gt;&gt; Why not? Why? What possibly do you said you'd be like this today? &gt;&gt; You're talk to him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Why didn't you talk to my dad today? &gt;&gt; Wait, can we wait? Can we really quick or you can do the dad thing first, but can we just go around? Can we quickly say what actually would be the ideal outfit? What is your ideal outfit for every human on earth? I would want everybody in a sundress. &gt;&gt; Baggy jeans don't fit. I would want everyone in a sundress &gt;&gt; and it's also tattered cuz they need to be saved because everybody everyone's been ravished and they all want to be ravished in the sundress. &gt;&gt; Well, that's true. I put I put you in one once. It was nasty. &gt;&gt; It was nasty. He got his eyes stank and his eyes turned black. &gt;&gt; His pupils just turned black. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Why did your pupils turn your pupils are black? &gt;&gt; No, but like the whole eye turn. &gt;&gt; My pupil turned black. &gt;&gt; Oh, your the whole eye turned black. &gt;&gt; That was crazy. &gt;&gt; From the ecstasy. &gt;&gt; All cuz I threw a sundress on him. He was already wearing clothes underneath, too. &gt;&gt; This is mine. I would have everybody in a breathtaking sundress and they would all look beautiful. &gt;&gt; That's awesome. &gt;&gt; And you can pick any pattern. It's awesome. &gt;&gt; White tea jeans and Vans rest of life. Literally can't go wrong. &gt;&gt; Those slip-on black pants. Slip on black &gt;&gt; for guys and girls. &gt;&gt; Yeah, everyone. And the literally cannot go wrong. &gt;&gt; And what? And the NBs. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; And that be if everyone dressed they'd be like GTA before they like could model different like guys. &gt;&gt; Like you walk into the mall and everyone's dressed like that. It'd be like is this place getting robbed? &gt;&gt; It would honestly be kind of fine. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; it would be fine. &gt;&gt; It's very inoffensive. &gt;&gt; Lo's kind of dressed like that right now. &gt;&gt; Almost. I am dressed like that right now. Basically, &gt;&gt; I think like Catholic Catholic priest like Catholic priest day off outfit. &gt;&gt; The real question is sorry. Can you look up a Catholic priest day off? &gt;&gt; Like you know when he's not doing the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sermon. &gt;&gt; Oh, he's got the &gt;&gt; when he's just in his office and he's got the black collared shirt on. He looks like a little bit like a Japanese school boy &gt;&gt; like this. No, no, I know what you're talking about. &gt;&gt; No, that upper right &gt;&gt; the black all black &gt;&gt; that kind of not quite like priest from Flea Bag. Priest from Flea Bag. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Google that. Google that. It's this guy's outfit. &gt;&gt; Flea Bag. &gt;&gt; Uh the show. &gt;&gt; Great show. Yeah. This fit. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love that guy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You always make sure you have the little uh neck collar. Yeah. Everybody needs that collar. &gt;&gt; That's &gt;&gt; So this is for every I'm sorry. I'm good with this. So your outfit for everybody on Earth is a religious outfit. Understanding that there are more people who are not Christian than Christian on earth. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Cuz I think they need to assimilate. &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, counter point. &gt;&gt; Isn't this great? You want to live &gt;&gt; You want to Sorry. You want to live in what country again? Sorry, it's in the &gt;&gt; It's all I know. &gt;&gt; Everyone should wear a turban. Okay, here's my ideal outfit. &gt;&gt; Wait, wait, wait for everyone on the planet. &gt;&gt; This is kind of I'm down. I could also go in that direction. &gt;&gt; Head to toe. &gt;&gt; Giant turban. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Like bigger than your your own head. &gt;&gt; Can you look at world's largest turban? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; On everyone has to dress like devout seek men. Big ass turban. Damn. All right. So big ass turban like that. Looks like you have a globe on your head. It's crazy that I Okay. Potentially going to say something crazy. These are all the same guy, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. It's I mean this guy's apparently &gt;&gt; does that guy &gt;&gt; they're saying this guy's ter. But does that guy have more hair? &gt;&gt; Cuz the whole dumbest question. Isn't the whole thing if you're like a devout, you never cut any of your hair, right? &gt;&gt; He keeps basketballs in there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He has the fastest growing hair of anyone and so he has to wrap it real big. Dude, they're saying it's 100 pounds &gt;&gt; with the with the head. &gt;&gt; That's just the VLC logo. &gt;&gt; Okay, so turban. Then we go down. Face plague doctor mask. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Practical. Everything's practical. &gt;&gt; Yeah, this is practical. &gt;&gt; No shirt. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Yeah, this is practical. &gt;&gt; So, no shirt for anyone. &gt;&gt; No shirt. Nobody gets a shirt. &gt;&gt; Okay. Do they get a bra? &gt;&gt; If you want a bra, you can wear a bra. &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; I think that's fair. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, look at the guy. Yeah. So yeah, plague doctor. No shirt. &gt;&gt; Everybody looking like that. &gt;&gt; Yes. Well, &gt;&gt; with a turban. There's a giant turban for pants. Obviously, the pants that can turn into shorts if you want to zip the the second half of them. &gt;&gt; I was going to say the big question should be shorts or pants. &gt;&gt; And you solved it. You've just solved that. &gt;&gt; He's added a lot more problems, but he solved one. &gt;&gt; And uh and finally, black Air Force Ones. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The Nike company is going crazy for this. Why the crime rates gone up? &gt;&gt; So I think through this conversation I've I've solved &gt;&gt; Dude, it has heat. &gt;&gt; A walking dead frame. &gt;&gt; What is happening to his leg? &gt;&gt; What do you mean? &gt;&gt; Oh, his legs are really skinny. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's all off. &gt;&gt; He's got very skinny legs. Those shoes are fire. &gt;&gt; Those are those are the shoes every IT guy wears. &gt;&gt; Yeah, they all were Solomon's &gt;&gt; utility shoes. &gt;&gt; Man, &gt;&gt; I really wasn't born for this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] was I? That has been a crazy transition where like all these like companies that were normally just like utility or dorky Solomon [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] champion like sports or athletics are just like designer now. What happened &gt;&gt; is was Champion I think champion sports is different from like hiking and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; But Champion was just &gt;&gt; Solomon is the best example I can &gt;&gt; Champion was like Hannes &gt;&gt; Solomon like Solomon like hiking boots are fashion now. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like type in like Solomon like X I think it's like XT12 or something. Dude, it's gonna suck to just be a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] awesome IT guy who has hiking shoes and now you have to get them on like GR because they're all sold out. You have to compete with all these people that just want to wear your &gt;&gt; I didn't know this happened. What? Why? &gt;&gt; Yeah. This is what everyone wears these and these &gt;&gt; Why is that? &gt;&gt; These are just a hiking shoe. &gt;&gt; Is it Is it ironic? &gt;&gt; No, no, no. It's style. It's like people just were like, "Hey, these are like these things that normally you would only wear for this specific use. They actually kind of just look cool when you pair them with like now if you wore an entire hiking outfit around it like that aura goes away. There's a bit of interesting for hikers anymore &gt;&gt; of like oh you're wearing kind of like a skateboarders outfit but you're wearing a hiker shoe. It's kind of interesting. &gt;&gt; What pants would you wear with the style Solomon XT6? &gt;&gt; Uh you could wear really anything. You could wear jeans. &gt;&gt; Would you wear [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that with the Solomon's? &gt;&gt; Like what? Um &gt;&gt; I I wouldn't I think I could see people who would but I think it's weird cuz the Solomon's a really tight shoe. I think when you wear a tight shoe with a baggy pant, it looks weird. It looks like your feet are being disappearing. Like they're disappearing into your face. &gt;&gt; Your fashion's too much for me. &gt;&gt; But if you wear like a chunkier shoe, like these are a little chunkier, right? You look cool with that. &gt;&gt; You cannot say that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with the outfit you're wearing right now. Too much for me. With those shoes and those pants, you cannot say &gt;&gt; just to be clear, everything I own is a gift or from Cotton On. &gt;&gt; You cotton on. &gt;&gt; You You say this a lot, but &gt;&gt; everything I own. &gt;&gt; I still think you're choosing to dress yourself like we all are. Like you don't get to say like no I just there's a machine that just put my pants on like a robot. &gt;&gt; All I said is fashion's too much based off Nick's analysis of why Solomon wouldn't be good to these pants cuz that's above my pay grade. &gt;&gt; Whether or not whether or not you have that thought yourself a subconscious process is going on there. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; I watched you pick your shoes, bro. I don't think we didn't see. &gt;&gt; We watched it. He has his shoes on a door. &gt;&gt; We do. He had like 20. &gt;&gt; He stared at them. Yes, he did. He did like in the library of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] other &gt;&gt; van. The smell of the closet. Can we talk smell that bad? &gt;&gt; The the hairs in my nose all curled up. &gt;&gt; No, they they don't smell that bad. &gt;&gt; They smelled kind of &gt;&gt; Okay, I have a question for you guys. Would the way you dress yourself change if we didn't have a show every week where people see us? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Cuz mine would. &gt;&gt; Whoa. Yeah, this might be surprising, but all the t-shirts I buy, I have a lot of shirts I've like bought and like thrown away or Goodwilled, the one that's in the Nike logo. It says, "If I miss this jump shot, I'll kill myself." You were talking about like the one use ironic, you know, time of a shirt. I use the show to be like, "This would be funny to wear." &gt;&gt; We were having a conversation, someone pops in, I have this shirt. &gt;&gt; You're at the Baloo. You're not trying to rock that shirt. &gt;&gt; Uh, I mean, I am. It's both, right? Well, they're an audience, too. &gt;&gt; They're an audience, too. But like I I think I would be much less interested in selecting shirts if I had like a normal job. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't I don't do it for this show anymore than I do it for like I know people in public are going to see me today. &gt;&gt; I do it for the show for the shoes only. &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; Yeah. If I was never going to leave my house again, I'd dress different. &gt;&gt; I used to not, but then I would watch back the videos where my feet were out and I was like, I got to wear shoes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] black feet from the goddamn &gt;&gt; when it was like me here and it' be a cut of you and just my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] toes are out &gt;&gt; ugly ass toe in the frame. That's the only &gt;&gt; but I might be weird. I'm more comfortable physically like the way we talk about fit and comfort. I'm more comfortable in jeans than shorts. &gt;&gt; Even though I am like fully free in short cuz you run away. &gt;&gt; There is something you have you ever Okay, little autism moment. You ever wore a backpack and been like this is kind of nice? Little &gt;&gt; I buddy, that's full blown. &gt;&gt; Let me let me let me one up you. Uh I sometimes I put in AirPods just because I like how they are in my ears. &gt;&gt; Okay. You see what I'm saying? So So dude, &gt;&gt; don't say dude. Just do to me. &gt;&gt; In class to do to me. &gt;&gt; I'm doubling down the dude. In some in in in class when I was in high school, uh middle school, sometimes I'd sit down with my backpack still on and my teacher would be like, "Take your backpack off." And I'd be like, "I like it." &gt;&gt; That is psycho [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; And then they'd be like, "You have to take it off." And this is when teachers would do [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] just like that cuz like just to show they're a teacher. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'm like, "This doesn't I'm in I'm listening." Well, the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do you care about that? &gt;&gt; They're like, "Where do you got to go?" And I'm like, "Nowhere." I just like how it feels. &gt;&gt; Okay. To be fair, if I'm a teacher and some kid has a backpack on, it's like when you get in a fight with a guy and then he reaches into a duffel bag. Run. &gt;&gt; You know what? This is what I think. Ask me a question about what we're talking about. And if I can answer, then you know, chill. &gt;&gt; Well, nowadays, but if you you win that argument like when you grew up, the teacher would win. Now, you just stand up, you go, I'm neurode divergent. This is my comfort backpack. &gt;&gt; That teacher [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] buckles. &gt;&gt; And the backpack has a big uh like embroider on it and it says do not pet. &gt;&gt; Yes. It's also a creeper. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And that teacher melts like the wicked witch of the west and the whole [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] class applauds. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And we're studying uh we're studying blue hair dye serum class or we're in the vaccine course. &gt;&gt; N Red was the teacher and N's teacher. &gt;&gt; What about you? Do you choose your outfits for the pod? &gt;&gt; We're on camera every week. &gt;&gt; Not once. Not even not even when I silver leotard. &gt;&gt; I believe this hair. Yes. &gt;&gt; For you. &gt;&gt; Like I if I wake up and have a terrible hair day, &gt;&gt; uh I will like it'll determine whether or not I'm like late. &gt;&gt; What happened today? &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; Um what happened? &gt;&gt; No man. What was that? I get the first I get the first part. What was the last Miranda [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Um &gt;&gt; yeah, a lot of the comments you posted that short of me and a lot of the comments are like the lettuce on that kid and I'm like is that good or bad? &gt;&gt; What does that mean? &gt;&gt; They're saying the hair the wedge on that &gt;&gt; the hair looks like lettuce. &gt;&gt; You know what's funny is right now I think it looks good but I don't know maybe I'll change my mind if I look back in 6 months &gt;&gt; of his hair. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But I think this of many people including myself where you look at them now and I'm like yeah it looks good looks normal. Yeah. But then you I look at like if I look at a picture of Aiden 8 months ago, &gt;&gt; it's interesting. &gt;&gt; It's crazy. I think it's the justosition cuz when I go back and watch old [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] where Nick's hair is short, it's weird. &gt;&gt; Depends how short I I that that there's that comedy compilations channel that gets more views than our own clip channel. Um &gt;&gt; shout out uploaded our misogynistic clips. It's a lot of you, Nick. &gt;&gt; Well done. &gt;&gt; That was today's upload. &gt;&gt; Well, women have constantly chosen me as a favorite. Shout out, SA. Um anyway, uh they made that compilation of like me saying dumb stuff. And in that my hair changes a lot. It's all back to back so I can watch it. And I was like watching I was like next next like like I look fat with that hair, I look whatever. And then I finally got to like it was shorter than this by a lot. You know, it was up here but it was still long and I was like that's probably my my set length. &gt;&gt; That's probably the real length my hair should always be. But this has been an experiment in being almost 30. Kind of like Bobby Scar. I realized I'm having a Bobby Scar moment. Bobby Scar &gt;&gt; where I'm getting lazier and lazier and I'm playing awesome video games and my hair is getting long. &gt;&gt; Interesting. &gt;&gt; Oh, he did do the Bobby. &gt;&gt; Was he the Bobby Scar all along? &gt;&gt; Yeah, he invented bits. &gt;&gt; No, cuz he's he's less of an ideas guy. &gt;&gt; Nick. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Good way or bad way? &gt;&gt; Well, I think there's pros and cons, but I I would say generally in a good way. Like you like doing more than &gt;&gt; Oh, God. &gt;&gt; No ideas. &gt;&gt; That means you're doing that means you're destined to become a stay-at-home dad. Hold this against the clip where Lewig said I was an ideas guy that one time and I never forgot it. &gt;&gt; Oh man, that pissed me off this. I don't even remember this. &gt;&gt; I remember this. You're an ideas guy and I was like, "What? &gt;&gt; You cut his teeth, &gt;&gt; dude. I don't even remember what homie said that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in my 20s. I apologize to my wasn't me." And let me tell you, I did not bring it to my 30s. &gt;&gt; I'm still growing. &gt;&gt; You're mature, man. &gt;&gt; I'm I am matured.

He's going to He's I'm not going to crash cuz I'm going to learn from the best. &gt;&gt; You're not going to do this. &gt;&gt; I I'm going to do this. &gt;&gt; You don't have enough time to learn how to fly. &gt;&gt; Well, that's why I have to shorten the paths. and he is the one making sure the path is always in a straight line because he still does that. And &gt;&gt; I forgot about that. &gt;&gt; He still does that. Uh and and yeah, I have enough time. Like right now I'm doing an F4 race. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So I have to train for that.

One while falling said, "I'm gay. &gt;&gt; I'm gay, by the way." &gt;&gt; And now I'm in the nest and he finally gets to show someone how to fly. &gt;&gt; You don't fit in the nest. You You're fat ass. &gt;&gt; Yes, Aiden. Dude. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Genuine question, Aiden. Who among the three of us, and I want you to be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] honest. Take away the sheen of the show. Turn off the camera. &gt;&gt; Oh god, we're being dead serious. &gt;&gt; Who do you think your dad would like to hang out more for like a whole week of the three of us? &gt;&gt; That's seven days. It's &gt;&gt; not I just go ahead. It's not me. I know that. You can skip me. Lwick. &gt;&gt; It's definitely I think you know what I think I think his dad likes the celebrity a little bit. &gt;&gt; I think his dad I think he likes the celebrity. &gt;&gt; No, he he like when we talk off &gt;&gt; when we're in a room, bro. When his dad shows up and we're on a roomwig, &gt;&gt; what a what a little what a skirt. &gt;&gt; Hey, love. Got any awesome project? &gt;&gt; Funny how you guys don't understand. And it's my RZ that does that. But you like to you like to make it something you can't &gt;&gt; to be honest. If one of you told my dad that you want to learn how to fly a plane, it becomes you in that room. I bet. &gt;&gt; Oh, he's Oh, I see. &gt;&gt; He loves planes more than anything else. &gt;&gt; Your dad's here and I'm like this like he's like, "What are you doing?" I'm like, "I'm just practicing flying. Little hobby I picked up." I Nothing. Sorry. Nothing. What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; Just some stupid stuff. Good to see you. &gt;&gt; But why allow why why not me? Cuz I thought it was me. cuz you don't want to fly. &gt;&gt; I thought it might be you, too. &gt;&gt; But then you thought about think about it. &gt;&gt; Have you ever Okay, here's what it is. I think we we said it was a If it's a day, it's not. &gt;&gt; I like that. &gt;&gt; I like that. I'm a sprinter, not a not a distance runner. &gt;&gt; You're neither. We've seen it. &gt;&gt; Hurtful. &gt;&gt; I mean, he's got the fit today. &gt;&gt; No, he has the best outfit for it. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he does. His outfit [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] glides. &gt;&gt; If it's 24 hours, it's Anthony. &gt;&gt; I'm a gunman. &gt;&gt; Anthony is the one. I'll say Anony's the one he asks about the tortoise run that that won that damn race. Lewig remember that. That's a life lesson. &gt;&gt; And he was bald as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; We were the tortoise. No, no, we were the hairs &gt;&gt; versus with him. &gt;&gt; And he was the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the kid from BYU. &gt;&gt; Oh, he was a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] jet engine. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he was an F1 caret. &gt;&gt; Uh, is it your dad? Ask me ask. Yeah. My parents when they call both of my parents uh included my mom. &gt;&gt; Oh. &gt;&gt; So my mom when I both Yeah. When I talk to my mom and talk to my dad on the phone, the one of the first questions they always ask me is, "How's Anthony doing?" &gt;&gt; I think they're concerned. &gt;&gt; Yeah. They're worried. &gt;&gt; This is the thing. &gt;&gt; How's your friend that sleeps on the floor? &gt;&gt; Oh, it's cuz when you're when you have dead parents, everyone always asks about you. It's a parent thing. This happens. It's happened for half my life now. They always say, "How's it going?" It might be that because Anthony gets invited to all of our family holidays. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; because they know I don't have a family. &gt;&gt; Lonely on the holidays. &gt;&gt; All the wives are bringing you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] food. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I get fed like a pig. &gt;&gt; It's awesome, dude. One day with each of our families. &gt;&gt; Oh, family swap. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; Okay. What family would you want? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Whose family would you pick? If we're officially our families officially adopt you, whose family do you pick? have the most fun with &gt;&gt; and you have the strongest connection with Nick's mother. So, it would make sense to be &gt;&gt; so easy, right? &gt;&gt; Like we would just the chemistry would just sparks would fly. &gt;&gt; Um I don't I I think I think I think hanging out with Lewig's mom would be really funny. &gt;&gt; Funny &gt;&gt; cuz cuz I think that you know how she said she like went to a big party and then just read in a corner for the whole time. &gt;&gt; It was my birthday. You were there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I would I like I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with that heavily. &gt;&gt; So he really What he's saying is I want to not spend any time. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Well, you'd be hanging out with Peter all the time, too. &gt;&gt; He wants to not do activities. &gt;&gt; I can hang out with Peter. Me and Peter could chop it up. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; there's a lot going on there. &gt;&gt; I definitely take Aiden's family 100%. That'd be awesome. Peter Peter would tell you all about the awesome strike he's involved in. &gt;&gt; He's in a strike. &gt;&gt; It's not technically a strike, but he's on strike. &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, tell me more. &gt;&gt; Well, there's two ways that lawyers get paid. One is as a public defender where the state will give you a case and you get paid a flat hourly rate by the state and there's like a private client. And in the state of Massachusetts where he practices law, all the lawyers aren't taking public cases anymore. &gt;&gt; Why? Whoa. &gt;&gt; They're not taking that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; they're they're going in and out on them. &gt;&gt; They're going in and out. Yes, sir. cuz cuz they get paid $65 an hour by the state and competing states are like &gt;&gt; poor thing &gt;&gt; like 90 to 100 plus. Oh, so new, sorry, Massachusetts is just like like way lower. And so they're like, &gt;&gt; I've said this, we got to up the minimum wage for lawyers, bro. &gt;&gt; $65 an hour. That's basically Do you guys know how much 65 an hour is? &gt;&gt; Um, &gt;&gt; what? That's like &gt;&gt; like a year. &gt;&gt; Isn't that like 90k a year? &gt;&gt; If you do full-time fulltime, which obviously he's not doing full-time, but if you were to do like 40 hours a week, it's like 130k. &gt;&gt; Oh god. So you live you live in a tent. &gt;&gt; We mo the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of Peter. Um, yeah. You mock the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of most lawyers, dude. Yes. This podcast makes a gross amount of money. Yes. &gt;&gt; Um, &gt;&gt; that's crazy. &gt;&gt; Wait, but but low key 65 hours like a lot of money. &gt;&gt; Uh, yeah. But it's as it's it's lower relative to other states and hasn't increased in 15 years. &gt;&gt; That's crazy to me cuz mass Massachusetts is like the most breaded state. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; In so many ways. &gt;&gt; Well, well, that's why they're they're banning together and they're trying to use their collective bargaining power. All the lawyers are locking arms at the capital. &gt;&gt; How come you guys don't have wiener stencil on the east coast? &gt;&gt; Um, &gt;&gt; I feel like they would [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with that &gt;&gt; because it's too German. &gt;&gt; Oh, German. &gt;&gt; Right up the alley of the kind of like white Protestant. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. That's I We're more Irish Catholic on the East Coast. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; not Protestant working class is Pennsylvania. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; You know, &gt;&gt; are there Wishles there? &gt;&gt; Oh, for sure. &gt;&gt; Interesting. &gt;&gt; But they're that's probably where the flagship store is. What's that dog [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] gas station that has food that everyone likes out there? &gt;&gt; Uh, wawas. &gt;&gt; Yeah, about that. &gt;&gt; Wawa's rules. &gt;&gt; Everyone's like, "Yeah, exactly." &gt;&gt; Everyone that's from there is like, "Dude, Wawa is so good." You go there and just like, "This is garbage, &gt;&gt; man. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] meat. Y'all eat the &gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Sammy." Sammy from Wawa. That's pretty good. &gt;&gt; I know. I pissed off everyone just now. &gt;&gt; Wawas is as good. &gt;&gt; Hey, &gt;&gt; don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cancel me for that, bro. Sorry. I don't like Waw Wasa. &gt;&gt; It's as good as like a Family Mart in Japan. &gt;&gt; No, it's not. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. I feel like now you're being [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Now I don't know what to believe because how could something trump the beautiful great &gt;&gt; So shouldn't my opinion be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] true here? &gt;&gt; I mean, this is a huge vouch. It's a huge vouch. &gt;&gt; I'm the Japan guy. &gt;&gt; Okay, I'm in a room. I have anthropomorphic versions of Japan and New Hampshire next to me and a gun. &gt;&gt; And I say I say love, &gt;&gt; they're guys. &gt;&gt; Let I I have to kill one of them. And then &gt;&gt; how many bullets are in the gun? &gt;&gt; One. I have one bullet in the gun. &gt;&gt; It doesn't work on yourself. &gt;&gt; It doesn't work on either. &gt;&gt; I had five more bullets and I shoot New Hampshire six times. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he's already uzies. &gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] light him up. &gt;&gt; I saw him in half. &gt;&gt; I see that this question was very easy for you. Uh, let's change it. Uh, instead of New Hampshire, anthropomorphic New Hampshire, it's Tom Brady. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. And and Family &gt;&gt; Tom Brady and the Nation of Japan. &gt;&gt; Oh my god, that's a hard one. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Post Buddy. &gt;&gt; Tom Brady's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dead on the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] floor. &gt;&gt; I'm standing over. I'm going bow bow bow bow bow bow. &gt;&gt; Finally, you take a stand against &gt;&gt; I'm getting the kiss cuz I'm also lowkey always kind of wondered the grenade. &gt;&gt; Look, he died a legend. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Tom Brady dies in the most insane of circumstances. Whole nation of Japan saved. They make statues of Ludwig in Japan. &gt;&gt; They make statues of Tom Brady. &gt;&gt; If they offered to put a golden statue of you in the middle of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Harajuku, would you take it? &gt;&gt; Can I swap it with Nick Engling? &gt;&gt; No, it's you. It's you. &gt;&gt; I do like how every time a question like this gets asked, you're just like, "What if instead of me?" It seems like an obvious yes because it's just like yeah, a golden statue mean of course awesome, but you have to deal with the real repercussions of a white man being put in the middle of Harajuku for literally no accomplishments and no contribution to the to the nation. &gt;&gt; No, throw me in. &gt;&gt; You do it. &gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz cuz all you're saying like doesn't matter. A statue 50 years after it's put up is like the only people who know why that statue's up are the people who [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] read the little thing. In the modern day, bro, we're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] We kick statues over now and we [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pull we get ropes and we tug them down and we put them on Instagram. &gt;&gt; I think we should get rid of all statues. &gt;&gt; Whoa. Veto. &gt;&gt; Every single one. &gt;&gt; No. What about the biggest statue in the world? &gt;&gt; I can think of I can think of statues I like. &gt;&gt; Well, there are statues we don't like, so get rid of them all. &gt;&gt; You'd get rid of the Statue of Liberty. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's like It's like Australia getting rid of the guns. It's like doesn't matter if some guns are awesome. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter if a Desert Eagle's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cool. Just twirl around your room. &gt;&gt; Wait, this is stupid. &gt;&gt; No, it's not stupid. It's awesome. &gt;&gt; What What's a bad becomes a mountain again. &gt;&gt; Well, I I can't even name five bad statues. &gt;&gt; That's crazy. &gt;&gt; Have you ever seen Alexis that boy boys short of uh interview with guy who makes all the racist statues? &gt;&gt; Super good. &gt;&gt; What's the racist statues? It's like he's just like, you know, uh like old colonial leaders or like people from the Civil War, but it's it's like a mockumentary piece about how they're just asking the guy and he's like, "It's a great business cuz like they tear him down in 100 years and then they put in a new order and you get to make a new racist guy." &gt;&gt; Yeah. All All statues got to go, &gt;&gt; dude. That would be my glorious country. &gt;&gt; That would be so bad, man. &gt;&gt; And everyone is also in the army. &gt;&gt; Thinker, I think. Yeah, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] him. &gt;&gt; Any any situation that I could have myself up on like a billboard or painting statue of me in any situation, I would rather have it be Nick Yingling. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I agree. Oh my god. &gt;&gt; I I don't think I can think of any situation where I wouldn't want it to be Nick. &gt;&gt; Dude, Nick Yingling in like the like like Shanghai and one of those big light up buildings like overlooking the entire city. I want I want one of those like LED light shows on the side of skyscrapers to be &gt;&gt; Nick. What if we What if just for a month we forgo our Patreon salary and we put all of it into marketing for Nick Engling and we just billboards. I'm talking plastered all over LA. I'm talking [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I want Time Square. I want the billboard. I want like Dude, I want I want when you go to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] uh like Wahoo Fish Tacos, I want the cup next to Iron Man. You got Nick and &gt;&gt; he's like folding his arms next to Tony Stark. &gt;&gt; He's like, is it like a Sweet James? Is it like a Find This Man? Is it &gt;&gt; It's more like a Find This Man where it's or Dream This Man where it's just like, "What is this? I'm seeing it everywhere." &gt;&gt; The best thing we could do is pay for one of those just just at least one billboard off the 10. It's Nick Yingling like that and it says Le accident. &gt;&gt; Dude, accident with Yes. But no contact information. I just want to do that. &gt;&gt; This would ruin his life forever. &gt;&gt; What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; Well, look, if we were successful in our campaign and he got big to like uh like a point where he got recognized, he would just be harassed. Do you think he would? That's what I'm wondering. &gt;&gt; What he doesn't like, and you guys will stop doing this, is when he like says anything on Twitter, it' be like, "Damn, did you just figure out about [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dinosaurs or something?" So, you got to stop doing &gt;&gt; What if we made What if we made like for a TBH billboards? &gt;&gt; Oh my god, that's what you guys don't know. Yingling and it says like for a TBH. It's him smiling and not no one gets one. &gt;&gt; That's old Yingling. Yingling used to like for a TBH &gt;&gt; of like of skinny emo Nick Yingling from like when he was a teenager. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Old Yingling had I mean there's a reason why he's he's so important to us like philosophically. &gt;&gt; It's not that he like does work. &gt;&gt; He represents a purity. &gt;&gt; Yes. Like Yingling would unironically post like for a TBH and then I think the last one he did was like two years ago. I like that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I got a TBH. &gt;&gt; You got one? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I still have my TBH from like 8 years ago. &gt;&gt; I'm going to read it. &gt;&gt; I've never gotten one, bro. &gt;&gt; I've never gotten one. &gt;&gt; This could be too hard to find. I will say though, &gt;&gt; dude. Look how much you bent it. &gt;&gt; And those are the running shoes. This thing was perfectly Have you seen the Someone posted a screenshot &gt;&gt; of what this thing looked like on episode one to now &gt;&gt; and there's like a there's like a time lapse. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that is awesome. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] discovered. &gt;&gt; We have [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm going to try to fix. &gt;&gt; We're going to bury this one day. &gt;&gt; It's going to be our time. &gt;&gt; Last day of the podcast. &gt;&gt; Time capsule. &gt;&gt; It's going to be like the end of the We'll throw it down below your house like the still probably buried there like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Jurassic Park amber. So funny cuz as time passed like like grass and weeds started to like grow around it. &gt;&gt; It's got the Last of Us like mushrooms growing on it. &gt;&gt; Um &gt;&gt; what is the last &gt;&gt; uh the the Sabbathon bed? &gt;&gt; The Sabbathon bed that we threw in the back. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. Yeah, we should go back. &gt;&gt; We should go back. I was thinking about going back there. &gt;&gt; I was thinking of going back today because you guys are talking about Baloo. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; let's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] record an app at Kala. &gt;&gt; Dude, I have a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] gift card. He'll be so happy to see us at restaurant. Shout out Kushi and D. &gt;&gt; Amazing. It's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fire. Show up. &gt;&gt; Me and Yingling the when we were hanging out a few weeks ago, we're walking home and there was a whole SWAT team on a street in LA and we were wondering what's going on. And apparently this kid who was like in the kid like he was in his like early 20s. He's in the upstairs of one of those duplexes. And earlier that day, uh, his dad had tried to kick him out of the apartment and he tried to kill his dad with a knife and then barricaded himself in the apartment. &gt;&gt; I mean, you go rocket, they're going to go paper eventually. &gt;&gt; And then they had spent they had spent hours trying to get this guy out of the building and they had put up uh they had gotten a camera into the space and he had smashed it. So, we're watching the remaining part of the SWAT operation unfold, and there's all these police, all these crazy trucks in the street, and we watch them shoot rubber bullets into the windows of the upstairs building, and then fly a camera drone through the window into the building to like locate him in the room and then they then they raid the apartment and bring him out. And we watched all of this unfold over like an hour. It was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] huge. &gt;&gt; Is that watch? &gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz They had it they had it taped off and there was a bunch of people from the neighborhood like just sitting there watching &gt;&gt; immedately pull up. I'm wearing a bulletproof vest. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I feel like this is free. You just send in [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Mark Wahlberg with like a single BB gun &gt;&gt; and I'm saying guys I thin blue line. Love the police. How can I help in any way? I can go in by myself. &gt;&gt; I've experience uh mostly on the other side of this from you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I've been on the other side. I know inside and outside. Very rare phenotype for this kind of operation. &gt;&gt; I'll find his job. I'll tell him to quit it and get him out of I'll tell them to move away because this is annoying for SWAT team. &gt;&gt; The only thing they added to that operation was a drone. But they had basically everything else for us. &gt;&gt; I like the idea of all that happening and then they're pulling. They're dragging the guy out and he's just screaming and he's got a dildo strapped to his head and it's just flopping around. &gt;&gt; It was It was weird cuz he's just he's just dead quiet. He's shirtless and dead quiet. We watch him get put in the car. &gt;&gt; Imagine all all that. And actually, he has the shirt on that I mentioned before. &gt;&gt; Well, everyone would. &gt;&gt; The police would have it in this awesome world. The police would be &gt;&gt; and then they turn around and shoot me. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cuz you're there. &gt;&gt; The guy would be like, "Don't get me." And then &gt;&gt; that guy and then and then they he runs away stepping sounds. Oh yeah. Yingling's last uh TV tbh was in 2020. He said tbh. &gt;&gt; What month? &gt;&gt; Uh June. June. &gt;&gt; Was this on Twitter or Facebook? Is it Twitter? It &gt;&gt; was after &gt;&gt; tbh. You're the most raw person I know. Even more raw than Rob. who is someone with who's very raw. Every time I see out a major, it puts a smile on my face. I miss you, man. &gt;&gt; Dude, more more raw than active. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. &gt;&gt; It's a raw SoCal activist. &gt;&gt; He's raw. &gt;&gt; He's very raw. &gt;&gt; That dude is raw. &gt;&gt; God damn. &gt;&gt; So, well, I want I think the Nick Kingling idea actually is good. I think we should do it &gt;&gt; at the very putting like what a What does a quarter mill even get you? &gt;&gt; No, we &gt;&gt; a lot. We can get &gt;&gt; in advertising, dude. those like Lamar billboards like the smaller ones you can get like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; used to be I I I'd rather have one big billboard than &gt;&gt; but like a big billboard I don't know I think they're pricey. &gt;&gt; How much is a billboard in LA? &gt;&gt; I think it depend like a 100 rack for a month for a juicer. &gt;&gt; Okay guys, I looked into this once cuz I wanted to prank Hayden. I thought it'd be awesome. It's not as bad as you think. &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; Yeah. We could we could get we could put some damage out there. &gt;&gt; Actually, you know what? Well, but it I think it needs to be to be there for a while because I sometimes you know how those people do the billboard. &gt;&gt; I think I think you put up for a month. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. But I what I don't want is like there's a minimum. &gt;&gt; We've done like the billboard in New York and it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 13 minutes and it's rotating and it's like it's funny for the picture but ultimately any LED billboards unless they're Time Square though. &gt;&gt; I am an LED billboard hat. &gt;&gt; I don't believe in the LED billboard. But what if we do I think what we should do is make a fake company for something insane like lawyers against mayonnaise or some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's like really intense and then it's Yingling and he's in a suit and it's like a normal billboard ad and we get people to call and we like I don't know document them like we make it more than just like hey haha that's funny. We like engage with the world &gt;&gt; having a voicemail would be funny. It's like it's like a picture of Yingling and it says, "Tell him what you're afraid of." &gt;&gt; And then one day we listen to all the voicemails. &gt;&gt; It's like the ones around here that say like, "Do you need Jesus?" And it's literally like you call for Jesus. &gt;&gt; I I think I've figured a way to use Yingling, a billboard, and a little bit of creativity to take down Tommy Burger. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; it's it's Yingling next to a Tommy Burger. &gt;&gt; We strike a deal with all Tommy Burgers. We give him a quarter mill and it's a Yingling ad and he's next to it and we we tell him it's Los Aentes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. And he's our &gt;&gt; Colian as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] He thinks the joke's funny. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then we we [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] convince the world that Yingling has killed a school bus of children &gt;&gt; in an anim animalistic way, devouring them like Kronos to &gt;&gt; Yeah. No gun involved. Literally just raw like Cho'Gath like &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden all this press &gt;&gt; is right on Tommy Burger. &gt;&gt; Boom. &gt;&gt; Wait. Cuz everyone's going to be saying, &gt;&gt; "Oh no." Cuz cuz we're going to say, "What do you think the chili's made of?" &gt;&gt; What are the chili made of? &gt;&gt; What do you think the chili comes from? Snow piercer vibes, dude. Okay. What if it's a billboard and it's Nick Yingling and he's he's crossed arms smiling, but he's wearing an adult diaper soil poop up the back like a Tommy burger and then right next to it, we're saying nothing literally. It's just a picture of the Tommy Burger with the Tommy's logo. We do not We make no direct claims that those two things are related. &gt;&gt; And then we had a third. It's a fake healthcare company and it's just called connect the dots. &gt;&gt; Yes. Connect the dots. And the Tommy's logo. No apostrophe cuz we're It's like different company. &gt;&gt; Yes. Totally different. Not touching you. These are not touching you. &gt;&gt; Unrelated. &gt;&gt; Tommy, it's Tommy's plural. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; Different burger chain. &gt;&gt; We should try to take the How many locations are there &gt;&gt; of the world? Of like things. &gt;&gt; God, I hope there's not more than two. &gt;&gt; There's a few, man. &gt;&gt; Zipper. I think I said 30. &gt;&gt; 32. &gt;&gt; There's a couple. We can take them down. &gt;&gt; 32 locations poisoning the masses &gt;&gt; easily in SoCal or or we Okay. Some are in Nevada. Three in Nevada. I think before we destroy, we should be a bit vulnerable with ourselves. We should say, "Was this a bad one?" &gt;&gt; Maybe we should do a yard road trip and go to every single Tommy's. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's like the Rainforest Cafe, but it's butt. No, &gt;&gt; the Rainforest Cafe, but it and we go in like a butt mobile. &gt;&gt; The fast food the fast food challenge, but you have to eat. &gt;&gt; And we drive a car that runs on on nothing but methane. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. So, &gt;&gt; we sit in it and it's just a tube going into our ass, so we have to sit and power the car. And I'm like I'm like the goat &gt;&gt; and without letting 90 [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sleep when you go to bed we're pushing it. &gt;&gt; Dude, that is disgusting. &gt;&gt; No, you can put it on my ass while I'm sleeping. &gt;&gt; You guys don't So you guys want to do the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yard tour and I say I want to do and everyone [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] buckles up. &gt;&gt; Hey, I don't even [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with me. &gt;&gt; You were like we should go on a road trip and I'm like oh we could do a tour and you're like &gt;&gt; we should do the yard. &gt;&gt; I would do the yard if we do them in front of Tommy's. The only caveat is the tickets are free. You must bring a pitchfork. You have to you have to literally buy a pitchfork and come watch us eat &gt;&gt; a protest sign. &gt;&gt; It's like the guy who eats a whole chicken in New York for a month every day, but you have to come and you have to protest outside Tomy's and we're eating the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] burger to like &gt;&gt; and we eat the burger on the show and we talk how bad it is and then we do our pod. It's a normal pod and then we go to the next Tommy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And we and then we we we always kill one employee. &gt;&gt; What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] We we cut their head off to be sacrificed. &gt;&gt; And we kill one employee at every Tommy's in the world. &gt;&gt; You should be a seale employee, though. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. That's a minimum wage. &gt;&gt; No, no, we're killing a suit and tie. &gt;&gt; They I don't think they got 34. It's on [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] V show. &gt;&gt; Tommy's uh CEO. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's a good question. &gt;&gt; Listen, no, don't look this up cuz now it's turning into &gt;&gt; We were in a nice jokey area before and now it's turning. It's turning into a manion. You're going to meon. &gt;&gt; Get out. Pull us out. &gt;&gt; It's a woman. She's breathtaking. We shouldn't do this anymore. &gt;&gt; I would Can I say Can I say you said the yard road trip? I would love to do that. I want to do that for real. &gt;&gt; Guys, you should understand Lwig is more interested in doing stuff with us in this new era. And I think that's cool cuz like years ago we talked about like live show, he was very like this and that. It's like whatever, it's okay. But now he's he's bringing us ideas. He likes us again. again. Yeah, you you went away for a little bit there, but now you like &gt;&gt; Okay, hold up. Hold up. I've always liked you. We live together. We did content very often. &gt;&gt; I I would pull you guys out of the blue. I'd say, "Come down. We're going to eat every fruit." &gt;&gt; You threw us on the street and we started bang we started banging tin cups on the street for money for a while and we started banging toothless Swedish white nationalism. You got in to playing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] every video game. &gt;&gt; Like you're playing random ass games all the time. You got into league in rock climbing and freestyling. &gt;&gt; Really wide net on that for you. &gt;&gt; You've been like me that whole time from league to rock climbing to &gt;&gt; I'm pretty sure &gt;&gt; from us moving out rock climbing league in freestyling covers everything. &gt;&gt; Freestyling has been always food for me. &gt;&gt; I know. That's what I'm saying. Like those three activities cover the whole stretch of time. &gt;&gt; D when we were freestyling in the car in my head I'm like boom I'm electric. This is crazy. I went back and watched it. Those were ass. We suck at freestyling. &gt;&gt; Well, I think yours were interesting. Yours were you had something. &gt;&gt; Mine were [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] terrible, bro. &gt;&gt; I don't know how to do it. &gt;&gt; I think I think we're all a little &gt;&gt; I think our yard cipher we thought beat ams. I would now like to retract I never just to be clear I never a close tie &gt;&gt; cuz cuz when you said that was better than I was driving and I had chain mail on and I literally said what and I was like well wasn't a freestyle. It must have been real bad. Ours was pure off the I mean if we wrote you give me a week I'll write some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that Bobby Logic calls me up. Well, I think what you do is you run the Davis Strat where you would just sing. &gt;&gt; You're about to run right. &gt;&gt; I don't need to sing. &gt;&gt; You do a little ballad. &gt;&gt; It's I mean it's nice in a cipher to be honest. It's like a breath of &gt;&gt; fresh singer in the cipher and &gt;&gt; I can't I have too cold of bars I guess. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Too raw. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, is this a veto on the road trip or &gt;&gt; No, it's not a veto. &gt;&gt; It's the cipher road trip. The car runs on bars. &gt;&gt; I want to do the yard live. What &gt;&gt; if we just did the road trip? &gt;&gt; Yay. Let me just do the road trip. &gt;&gt; Oh, he got wet. Me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me. &gt;&gt; It would be so fun. &gt;&gt; Oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Sorry. &gt;&gt; I kind of want to do the road trip through the South. &gt;&gt; The South? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I want to just go see some parts of the country that I've never [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Let's go find our most racist fan base by state. You guys can keep conflating the South with racism. &gt;&gt; No. Okay. &gt;&gt; Isn't Oregon Oregon's like 95% white, 90% white or something? They got some crazy racists in Oregon. &gt;&gt; I think Oregon is probably more racist. Isn't what's the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what's the white? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Like I'm telling you white supremacist movie Idaho. Isn't Idaho really racist? &gt;&gt; I Yeah. Like that's what I'm saying. It's like there's a lot of areas that are like rural areas in the Northwest that are 90 [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] whatever% white that you don't like think of as racist, but that's because they don't have the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] opportunity to &gt;&gt; they don't have the Civil War brand. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I think I think you're actually you're on to something in that racism is a big spectrum of like optics and like &gt;&gt; racism racism is a spectrum &gt;&gt; but but people in the south racism people in the south are very like there there is this stereotype of being very upfront racist right like you also you if you grow up like in a in a white era you grow up with these like kind of &gt;&gt; like like racism that you don't know is that until you like grow up and understand the system outside of it. So it's like, yeah, it's like I think someone who grew up in Colorado can be just as race as someone in the South, but it's like more subtle and weird, but it's still based on the same like power. &gt;&gt; I think also race is racism is a is a is a a relic of an old time that I and I think the South is more embedded in the older times and values. You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; I think it just has to do with the bra I think it has to do with the Civil War. I think that's where it comes from. It has to do with slavery and the Civil War and we &gt;&gt; I'm against there's racists everywhere. That's &gt;&gt; against war. &gt;&gt; Well, put it on out there. &gt;&gt; That's actually what Trump said. &gt;&gt; What &gt;&gt; he was like, I don't think we needed the civil war. &gt;&gt; If I was president back then, we wouldn't have had the war. &gt;&gt; Yeah, the Civil War was a good thing. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he would have ended it in one day, like the Ukraine war. &gt;&gt; I guess it's a good thing because we won it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The war was a good thing ultimately means to an end. &gt;&gt; Dude, if you look at the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] If you look at the Civil War history, every state that got like added onto the grid, it was like, "Are you guys pro-slave or or anti-slave?" And they had to keep it even so everyone would be like happy. It's crazy. You watch one [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] video about how this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] worked. It was crazy. &gt;&gt; You heard it here first from the yard podcast. &gt;&gt; What can What can I say? I watch a Civil War documentary. It's called Bleeding Kansas. Look it up. Let's &gt;&gt; be clear. I don't think the South is all racist. I I don't want to come off like that. &gt;&gt; I just want to go on a road trip with my friends. Is that crazy? &gt;&gt; I do think that they're putting up record numbers. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, please. &gt;&gt; Yeah, they're putting &gt;&gt; They still got plantations. My argument is that the record numbers are everywhere. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; And that we need to be more vigilant. &gt;&gt; Wasn't that &gt;&gt; That's what I'm trying to say. &gt;&gt; I think racism's gone &gt;&gt; and ended with David Getta's DJ set. &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; Floyd DJ set. &gt;&gt; He did end it. &gt;&gt; Ended racism. &gt;&gt; I forgot about that. &gt;&gt; And how about how we can all move on after that? &gt;&gt; Who is David Geta? &gt;&gt; What? Are you serious? &gt;&gt; Are you Are you serious? I'm &gt;&gt; not. I promise. I promise I'm not stupid. You need to be real YouTuber. &gt;&gt; Is he right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. So, why am I stupid? Cuz music started doing music and he got pretty big. &gt;&gt; He kicked it off and then Oh, he's like a Bo Burnham Roblox guy who solved racism. &gt;&gt; Or maybe Joji's better, but &gt;&gt; Jo's a little bit better, but he's bigger than he is. &gt;&gt; He is bigger. He's a smaller YouTuber but bigger artist. &gt;&gt; He was bigger than JoJ when he did Roblox. &gt;&gt; I mean, if you look up look up David Geta like Spotify, so you can see his stream numbers. get a job. &gt;&gt; I don't know who this guy is for real. &gt;&gt; His looks kind of crazy when you think about what he used to do on YouTube. &gt;&gt; He tapped into a Spanish speaking audience early. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's what he buys doing today. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he is &gt;&gt; breaking records. Breaking necks. &gt;&gt; It's cuz Yeah. 79 million monthly listeners. &gt;&gt; What in the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Two billion plays. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm good, &gt;&gt; bro. I don't know anything about What does he look like? &gt;&gt; Uh, he looks like that one right there. The left one. &gt;&gt; He's on the left. Yeah, he's older now. &gt;&gt; He's been doing that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] since Roblox came out, bro. Middle school era vibes. &gt;&gt; He's like like critical, man. &gt;&gt; He was like our age when Roblox dropped. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he's older though. &gt;&gt; How old is David Gha? Can you look it up? I'm I'm fascinated. &gt;&gt; Like the godfather of that kind of content. &gt;&gt; He's 57. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he's old. &gt;&gt; How was he on Roblox? &gt;&gt; Came out. How long he was on the older side of those YouTubers, but like so PewDiePie's pretty old, too. n 19 years old. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, think about that. He was 38 when Roblox came out. &gt;&gt; Dude, there's still time. &gt;&gt; Like, you could start a Roblox channel today. I mean, Roblox maybe you maybe want to pick a new Roblox. Yeah, &gt;&gt; sure. You could start a Roblox channel today and you could be David become a DJ. 19 years &gt;&gt; and he did a and he solved racism. &gt;&gt; Do you have you never seen the video racism David geta cotton eye Joe &gt;&gt; Zipper had &gt;&gt; George Floyd? It's the wrong one. &gt;&gt; This sounds okay. Call me woke. This sounds extremely poor taste. &gt;&gt; The sentence you said it sounds the most extremely poor taste thing. &gt;&gt; No, when he came my crazy thinking that &gt;&gt; I get it. I'm listening now back from your POV. What I said sounds bad. It sounds crazy. &gt;&gt; But when you see it, it's like, you know, the Titanic sounds bad as a movie. If you explain, &gt;&gt; I think it's when you when you understand he's kind of I think if you understand more about him, it it was more endearing. &gt;&gt; It's also it's a song that was popular in his Roblox era. So, it's like a call back. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. I'm also being explained to this, you know, by some white guys also. I'm I just don't know. &gt;&gt; My My stepfather's black. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; If that puts you at ease, &gt;&gt; can I see this? I guess generational &gt;&gt; a generational clip &gt;&gt; is in honor of George Floyd. And I really hope we can see more unity and more peace when already things are so difficult. &gt;&gt; So shout out to his family. [Music] &gt;&gt; Wait, &gt;&gt; is this real? &gt;&gt; That's real. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's David. Get it? Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's not Cotton I Joe, though. &gt;&gt; Oh, what's the song called? &gt;&gt; Uh &gt;&gt; uh Hamster Dance. &gt;&gt; Hamster Dance. Oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] My bad. &gt;&gt; So, wait. Wait. Are you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with me? &gt;&gt; I mean, &gt;&gt; he literally played hamster dance after he clip. The clip is The clip is real. &gt;&gt; It's just an It is an insane clip, is it not? &gt;&gt; And people are People think this. Okay. You know what? What do I know? &gt;&gt; I didn't know David get noticed any racism since. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that sucks. That sucks. You got to report that cuz I haven't seen any. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's my fault. I got I got to call turn around. &gt;&gt; You see something, you say something, &gt;&gt; right? That's on me. &gt;&gt; Wow. I This Everyone knows about this. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Of course. &gt;&gt; I'm blown away. &gt;&gt; I think a lot of people don't realize cuz he was a Faceless YouTuber, so a lot of people don't realize it's the same person. &gt;&gt; Well, it's kind of like, you know, how a lot of JoJ fans don't know &gt;&gt; Frank. Philly Frank. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Wow. Well, such an educational day for Slime on the Yard. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh, I genuinely think, and call me crazy, what if we do the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the Tommy's? Every Tommy's. &gt;&gt; Oh, you like my idea? &gt;&gt; I love that idea. I love that. &gt;&gt; If you guys love on the road and doing funny shows, be amazing. &gt;&gt; I want to live in a van with you. &gt;&gt; Then we can't map the South. Some marketing person there is just going to stumble into an awesome. &gt;&gt; We go to every cookout in the South. &gt;&gt; No, that'd be good. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that would be good. &gt;&gt; I'm hungry. &gt;&gt; Cookouts are good. I I I need to see the the map spread of it. Like how hard is it? &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; That's cuz they're in only California and Vegas, which makes it convenient, but like how many can we knock out in LA? &gt;&gt; So many of them, I bet. &gt;&gt; Well, you also want to How long did it take Ted and Eddie Bearback to do it? &gt;&gt; Eddie Burbback. &gt;&gt; Obviously Eddie Bearback is not in the &gt;&gt; Eddie back. [Music] Wait, this map is zoom out. Zoom out. Zoom out. Is it all? Oh, right. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I thought it was over. &gt;&gt; There are some in Vegas. So, we're not getting &gt;&gt; scroll all the way out if and it maybe can show the rest. &gt;&gt; Dude, they're all close together. There's none. Hit the research. Hit the research. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now, search using the southern half of the the country. &gt;&gt; I think we could knock it out and probably &gt;&gt; none of them go past Santa Karita and none of them go past on the bottom. &gt;&gt; No, I think it's the map, bro. &gt;&gt; I think they're still missing. That's not 32. &gt;&gt; We're cuz they had their headquarters in Monrovia. Where's that? Uh, that's not 32. &gt;&gt; Yeah, look, there's some further ones. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; if you zipper, can you zoom out and then just hit the search again? &gt;&gt; He did that. He did that. Look, it's there. &gt;&gt; There. There. There. There. There's one in &gt;&gt; it changed. &gt;&gt; That was on the 10. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Why did it just change? &gt;&gt; That one's pretty far. &gt;&gt; That's in like high desert. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; I think you see low tier god. &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, let's do the viewers. &gt;&gt; Does tier god live in the desert? &gt;&gt; They're going to say yes. Of course they're going to say yes. &gt;&gt; Why are they going to say yes? They don't even know. What's the content that comes out of this? Is it one video? Oh. Oh, I thought Sorry. It's not the doing the shows there thing. It's the &gt;&gt; No, I don't think we could re I think we would get shut down if we tried to do a show. &gt;&gt; Um &gt;&gt; I I think look, it's just something we can workshop, but like that's the real question. They Ted and Eddie went all the way across the country, which is crazy for one video. Okay, sure. With two videos, sure, but we would do a live stream maybe in a week. We hit every Tommy's that exists. &gt;&gt; That'd be crazy, &gt;&gt; dude. And then we do one at the last one. You know how people say that superers size me was like blown out of proportion that like it like he kind of out overplayed how bad it was. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Zipper. &gt;&gt; Um, this will be as bad as people think that was. &gt;&gt; There's three in Vegas. I think this would probably take us like 4 days to do. &gt;&gt; This might kill one of us. &gt;&gt; I think this w will be worse than him than the superersized meat guy just drinking a bunch of alcohol like he was doing. &gt;&gt; No. 30. What? &gt;&gt; No, I'm saying eating McDonald's. &gt;&gt; I think it'd be better to be What is it? We have to eat one thing from every spot. Why is that that bad? That's like it's &gt;&gt; Did you look at it? &gt;&gt; What? It is horrendous. Maybe they have an item that's not that bad on the menu. &gt;&gt; Do we have I think there's enough to get every single item. &gt;&gt; This is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] They should not be allowed to show the food like this. &gt;&gt; Breakfast. &gt;&gt; Dude, that breakfast burrito does look disgusting. &gt;&gt; How do they even the even the best case pictures of the food look terrible &gt;&gt; with their whole menu? &gt;&gt; I &gt;&gt; Well, they've been ref they've been refining the classics, bro. They have they have chili. &gt;&gt; They just put the love into the important ones. &gt;&gt; They just have like literally four items. They have burger, chili burger. &gt;&gt; If you eat that &gt;&gt; dog, fries. &gt;&gt; If you eat that chili that go up, if you eat that triple chili cheeseburger like with a smile on your face, &gt;&gt; god damn, you're an eater. Like there no is that much different from a 3x3 plane? It's just 3x3 with the chili and the quality of the ingredients. It's the chili and the quality of the ingredients. That's it. It would also look it would also look nothing like that. &gt;&gt; Wait, is he alive? Can you look up if Tommy's alive? &gt;&gt; Cuz that's maybe what we should do. &gt;&gt; The business was open in the 40s. So, I do not believe so. But &gt;&gt; in the 40s, &gt;&gt; he could be. Yeah, &gt;&gt; he could be alive. &gt;&gt; Bro, there was only one. &gt;&gt; He could be narrowly alive. &gt;&gt; Was Tommy like 6 years old when he opened the restaurant? &gt;&gt; Like little Tommy and then his parents named after him. &gt;&gt; Oh, so Tommy Jr. is still alive and he's like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 90. &gt;&gt; The Tommy lineage is probably around. &gt;&gt; Tommy doesn't feel like a last name to me. &gt;&gt; No, no. I'm saying like &gt;&gt; Tommy stuff. I'm Bill Tommy. &gt;&gt; It's like Tommy Tommy Junior. Tommy Senior. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I don't know, man. Uh but that'd be so fun. We get like an RV. We stink it up. &gt;&gt; We stink the RV up. &gt;&gt; That'd be crazy. Tom, &gt;&gt; it's going to stink like load his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] shoes at the end of it. &gt;&gt; Okay. My shoes don't stink that bad. Oh, we could do a beat off in the RV. &gt;&gt; We do a beat off. We have a little &gt;&gt; God damn it. We got to Yeah, we got to freestyle and we got to make beats. Oh my god. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; And I could I could &gt;&gt; We got to come out with an album. &gt;&gt; I could come to this beat off. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, you could. You're allowed to come off. &gt;&gt; You can watch the beat off. &gt;&gt; I can't come. &gt;&gt; We'll have a couch. We'll have a chair for you. &gt;&gt; If you come at the beat off, it's a little bit weird. &gt;&gt; I know it sounds counterintuitive. &gt;&gt; Dude, he only died [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 33 years ago. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] We just missed him. &gt;&gt; Okay. Oh, let me just read this. Los Angeles Times first paragraph. Tommy Kulak, which sounds like a rank in the Kux Clan. short order cook who 46 years ago took a chunk of beef and surrounded it with a generous dollop of his personalized chili and &gt;&gt; generous. It was not generous. It was a heaping &gt;&gt; It was a dollop. It was a heaping mound. &gt;&gt; Wow. He died at 73. So he made it pretty far. Born in Oklahoma City to Greek immigrant parents. &gt;&gt; Ah the Kulux Clan. &gt;&gt; The Greek The Greek Kulux Clan. &gt;&gt; Damn, bro. It was Beverly and Rampart. Is that one still up? &gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure first. There's no way they get rid of the flagship. &gt;&gt; Damn. Maybe that's where we end it. &gt;&gt; Dude, he was a shipyard welder. &gt;&gt; And he said, "You know what? I want right now. &gt;&gt; He doesn't know how to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; cook. He doesn't know how to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] That's why that's why this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tastes like metal." You don't think &gt;&gt; he's like, "No, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; You don't think back in the day Tommy's hit? Like when when Tommy I bet it was crazy. I think when Tommy was cheffing it and you saw him make the chili and he put it was probably like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Yeah. When Tommy dumped [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mercury into &gt;&gt; I think I think you guys are conflating present day Tommy's with old Tommy's. &gt;&gt; Oh, I agree. I think cuz Tommy's when he died there were 17 locations. They've doubled to 32, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So they couldn't they couldn't keep the quality with the &gt;&gt; quity. Oh, no. That's in the 90 that's in the '90s. In 1992 they were serving 25,000 people a week. &gt;&gt; Oh, none of them are franchised. No one. It's kind of like a bittersweet uh situation here. Like Tommy's makes still true. &gt;&gt; Like evil CIA food, but also like &gt;&gt; dude, back in the day, Tommy's used to been such a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] awesome spot. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; He's got great grandchildren. &gt;&gt; Survived by his wife who this was in 1992. &gt;&gt; Okay, if you are a listener and you're part of the Kulux clan, please hit us up.

All right. So, yeah, we get an RV and we do it. &gt;&gt; The yard's going to change is what it sounds like. &gt;&gt; What do you mean? &gt;&gt; We're all going into this new end of the year. Why did you get why did you turn off the RFK boys? &gt;&gt; Why'd you turn into a into [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you guys up that we could be the most electric streaming crew maybe on the planet over AMP over phase and we just choose not to and we just do oneoff streams once a year. &gt;&gt; It doesn't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me up. It lowkey makes me feel good as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; dude. First off, &gt;&gt; no we couldn't. &gt;&gt; Yes, we could, bro. We're too lit. &gt;&gt; Second off, y'all are the problem there. Not me. &gt;&gt; Us. &gt;&gt; We're the problem. &gt;&gt; I share this sentiment, but I'm staying that blow up. You guys don't stream. &gt;&gt; We don't have to, bro. We be We'd be a crew who streams, bro. &gt;&gt; We're a crew. &gt;&gt; The whole point. &gt;&gt; How much does Phantom stream? Tell me right now. &gt;&gt; Not that much. &gt;&gt; Oh, interesting. &gt;&gt; [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] check. &gt;&gt; But there he is taxing the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] chili off the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] burger. We had him on that drive. He would ate a pickle. &gt;&gt; He streams way more than Aiden. &gt;&gt; Dude, I'll give you that. &gt;&gt; Different. &gt;&gt; He streams way more than different. &gt;&gt; He streams more than you, brother. &gt;&gt; I'll give you that. &gt;&gt; He streams more than slime. &gt;&gt; Yes, of course he streams more than &gt;&gt; Of course. Why would you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stream 100 hours? &gt;&gt; Kai's stream. I thought he was just on Kai's stream. &gt;&gt; No, he has his own stream. &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, so you're saying we need to be streamers in general. 87. &gt;&gt; That's this month. &gt;&gt; Uh, that's me or Phantom. Oh, that's me. &gt;&gt; He's got &gt;&gt; Dude, I think it's neck and neck. &gt;&gt; He's got 87 this month. &gt;&gt; 87 hours a lot. &gt;&gt; So, you're saying we all need to be like streamers? &gt;&gt; Stream group. Yes. You'll be streamers. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I don't want to stream. &gt;&gt; Yes. The whole [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] point is that it's not just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Kais streaming the five people who show up. It would be like I think the stream is better because we're not streamers, bro. &gt;&gt; I Well, I agree, but that then we should &gt;&gt; when I pull up to your stream and I'm like, uh, I got to be on my stream. I got my camera guy. &gt;&gt; Look, I'm not disagreeing with you, but I also then don't think our competition is am, bro. Our competition is people's attention. Nintendo vibes. &gt;&gt; I got I think I think I changed my mind just now. I want to start IRL streaming. I'm going to have a cameraman, but I'm gonna I'm not going to change anything about my life. So, the IRL streamer, I'm going to be like doing my job and they're going to be looking at like your social security number and your tax payments as I go through. &gt;&gt; We started off the stream that way last time. &gt;&gt; We were doing it like slime. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's funny, &gt;&gt; dude. I'm a cameraman. &gt;&gt; Clip was so funny. You're like, "So, what are we going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do? &gt;&gt; Let's get the food." You're like, "Just &gt;&gt; and I realized there's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Did anyone get something nice for themselves?" &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; We canceled it immediately. Did anyone get something nice for themselves? &gt;&gt; I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the fastest. &gt;&gt; You type racer faster than all of them. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's crazy cuz I would have bought something that time. &gt;&gt; Uh yeah. Well, they're not. &gt;&gt; They were probably stuck on that damn billing address, man. &gt;&gt; Yeah, they're still trying to sit in line for the Switch, too. &gt;&gt; Dude, Twitch shoes are hard to get right now still. Isn't that crazy? &gt;&gt; I watched a video yesterday of a guy IRL streaming with 20 of them in stock. &gt;&gt; What was he doing? &gt;&gt; He was just at a store [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] buying one. &gt;&gt; I sent out Aaron. I was like, "Can you see if there's a Switch 2 in town?" He's like, "I went everywhere. There's none. Did he go to GameStop? &gt;&gt; Are you sure he wasn't just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pulling it with the left? I went to Game Ly with the right. Oh my god. What's squeezing it with the right or it with the left? &gt;&gt; Sorry, Nick. Went everywhere today. &gt;&gt; He He might have been doing those two things. &gt;&gt; Sorry. Went everywhere. Yeah. And he's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] jerking it with the left. Jerks it good, man. He might on the clock on boss's dime. &gt;&gt; He can't say that. &gt;&gt; That's fine. &gt;&gt; I didn't say it. He's not I didn't say that. I'm just I'm throwing hypothetical. I can throw a hypothetical. We pay our employees and we can tell we can talk about that. &gt;&gt; I can say Kelly bust out the jeans. I get in that room. &gt;&gt; Cuz I think you're the one guy who shouldn't. &gt;&gt; It's a safe place. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Oh man. &gt;&gt; Kelby actually makes enough money that I think we can say that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about him. &gt;&gt; It's a safe place. Well, that makes it worse cuz now you're implying money is allowed to cover up any malfeasants. &gt;&gt; Uh Kelby. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Anyway, the thing is Kelby would agree with you. &gt;&gt; I'm David Schwimmer and I disagree. I think by the payroll numbers, Kelby makes more money than Lewig does. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, &gt;&gt; by the payroll. &gt;&gt; Cuz you don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pay me, dude. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I did dock his pay this year. That's real. &gt;&gt; I love that. &gt;&gt; He docked my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pay. He bitched me for 3 months to switch to Chase Bank cuz he says he loves Chase and the business that it stands for. &gt;&gt; Mhm. They've never done anything wrong. &gt;&gt; There's no ethical banks. We can get over that real quick. &gt;&gt; Well, I thought there were. &gt;&gt; The union banks, &gt;&gt; but he said no. And then he said, "We're going to dock your pay, too." &gt;&gt; Yeah, it was sick. &gt;&gt; I love that. I love you putting your foot down and taking money out of his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; And the way he explained it to me was through AI images sent to me on X &gt;&gt; with Grock. &gt;&gt; With Grock. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I made Grock make an AI diagram as to why you needed to lower your pay. &gt;&gt; You Well, let me ask you a question. If you're going to bite back on this, where is your Pokemon Crystal uh copy right now? &gt;&gt; I have all of them. I can show you all of them. &gt;&gt; Okay.

I asked him if he was getting I was like, "Taffo, has he talked to you about payment for all this?" He's like, "I'm not getting paid." &gt;&gt; He's getting paid. He like &gt;&gt; worked for hours. &gt;&gt; He got paid. He worked for three hours. Zero dollars. &gt;&gt; He got paid. I paid him in the cards. &gt;&gt; Ah, it's like it's like when you have the girls in in their underwear uh cooking up the crack &gt;&gt; and I give them a rock on the way out. Yeah. And you're like, "Here you go." And they got &gt;&gt; He he drops a He drops a PSA 10 card in Taff's bag.
