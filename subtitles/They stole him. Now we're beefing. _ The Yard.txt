was a choice yeah I chose to be straight Season Two end with the rainbow it is a choice l Stiller yeah it digs in the hand just goes limp and it's like yeah it's always like this my wrist limp there's thousands of people in the sub right defending it it's like I'm a pretty liberal person but I think Ben is making a really good point here what am I going to argue what am I going to argue with the greatest media of all time I found out cuz Ben Stiller is I guess outspoken politically which I didn't even know this I didn't know either I don't know where Ben Stiller is outspoken then I know but he's outspoken enough that there's a bunch of conversation about s and then replies will be like yeah it sounds amazing but I can't watch it cuz it's freaking rightwing or leftwing Ben Stiller wow they're like they're like uh edging themselves they're holding back Temptation they really do love to to to put blockers up I mean look it's if it's a good you can just watch it it's just a good show you can just watch it it's just the biggest you answer this what's like the biggest piece of like popular fiction by a right-wing like director director yeah like something not a book there's so much I feel like in books but like movies and TV an outspoken right-wing do you know anything those cartoons that the daily wire's been putting out uh those hit the The Smiths it's The Smiths I don't even know if he's right wing he's just racist he's kind of beyond the political Spectrum he's just his DOT exists outside I beat a man he was different than me in almost every way um I I can't think of oneof rip this more of a Ryan question just Ryan it's uh I mean we're talking o is Disney Disney Disney Yeah he talking OG yeah bro talking about the roots yeah sure the roots you don't create Disneyland through [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] social welfare and all that nonsense you got to I bet it's someone lowkey like that we don't know like Spike Jones dude it Spike Jones secretly right it could be hillbilly elegy what do you mean that's JD Vance yeah yeah that could be that's a pretty that was a pretty big movie it could be a big movie I'm saying that was a pretty big movie wait it was a movie yeah I didn't know that a book I didn't know that yeah it has um who directed Amy Adams I think Amy Adams is in it I think you're lying I can't remember her name that's crazy and it has another woman who's really famous I can't remember her name bre taking Amy Adams with the red hair uh breast taking Adam from American Superman fan Superman fan Adams my last Google search my last Google search was two halls wearing an ice key on his chest cuz I had a funny tweet idea um hillbilly L movie I don't know why I'm not just asking zipper to do it's Clint Eastwood no directed by Ron Howard um yeah just like famous Adams oh it's uh Glen Close yeah so that could be up there um yeah it does feel like there's less in Hollywood cuz they're all I think they're hidden though I think they're in there but they're they don't speak yeah cuz it's probably the minority in Hollywood you probably have less connections here but they all share a blood boy at the end of the day that's where they meet oh you know who's going to have they're going to have a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that podcast over there uhhuh blood boy blood boys under the table yeah think blood boys would be pretty good and DG be like I love AI yeah and then a TR going to shim being like yeah the green party in Germany is basically Nazis and then you're going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] end the episode yeah 1,000 comments and you're going to be like we really did it again that's theep yep we really did it again folks you what's what's the version of that for this show I've already done this it was the tennis it was a great it was a great you know truncated version yeah I would it's what I do it's my it's like he made one of those really really tiny paintings like with a real tiny brush I I feel like a a brush that you use to clean PCS here we go bro they're spreading misinformation it's notation I didn't see a picture a picture of you with a giant industrial vacuum cleaner and you're just like putting it into your 5090 sucking out what you called can I be real I didn't see why that was such a bad idea cuz he's sucking out nvidia's liberal juice that they put in because uh you think Nvidia is filled with liberal juice well yeah because the it like static electricity is often like something you avoid when you're touching sensitive components Can it can fry forever it can uh it's it's a little harder to do these days but if you have a big plastic vacuum that shocks you sometimes and you're standing on carpet and you're standing on carpet where she were and you know it's on Yingling's Twitter it's the it's I think he posted it recently and it looks insane it looks like you're it looks like you're taking like a um a power wash thing he started barking at the vacuum right when it turned on scr down he said it's revenge for what we say about him on the show for spreading this misinformation about me I mean to be fair that is literally what we do yeah like almost no don't look at me like that really don't give me that I can't resist I can't resist when he gives me a little funny face okay Yingling I in this is not a misinformation thing has been saying things to the office that I think are inappropriate there's been a couple incidents and I you need to get a hold of this place me dude he's been so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] unbearable why do I need to reel them in cuz you're the chief operations officer and it sounds like an operations thing not an executive thing D okay let me ask you real quick I'd love to get into this what is an executive thing cuz I feel like most things most things aren't right most things aren't you'll walk in something will be wrong and you'll be like ah it's an Aiden thing probably an operations issue and I really do wonder what falls under your it's interesting because he's your executive assistant right okay how about how about this how about throw things at me and I'll tell you CEO or coo Okay uh the problem you had earlier yesterday operations uh really yeah when there's poop and then there's p and then you took a p and the P poop weirdly an executive job apparently that's that's definitely an operations you literally explaining operations how you have to operationally but the executive did it dude I don't know I have hired somewhere along the way at terrorists and what happened well what happened is I've been living here cuz my beautiful girlfriend is out of town that's why he's wearing a cloak and so I see no reason to go home cuz a A House Is Not a Home when your loved ones are gone oh is my house a home that was P didy oh so yeah so if druski is in the house then it is a home those allegations were false and I still like could have been love okay I still like the show too much those allegations were oddly specific though it is fun how uh I'm not speaking I'm not speaking on the the Varity of the allegations but it is fun how like if you really like the person and they're like yeah I didn't do it you're like yeah I didn't do it yeah cuz you just really like the person what it all boils down to and conversely if you don't like the person you're like ah H interesting that's why like i' I've always said like man if Kanye dropped There It Is My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy 2 tomorrow album's like half good yeah so there it is he's just that's not good it's not it's just in the A90 box know and it's get it's an old PC it's a 2000 and up graphics card $2,000 it's a 207 I paid less than that for my first computer 270 and what I'm doing is I'm holding the vacuum in the air so that when I go over the parts with a micro brush and the dust Flows In The Air the dust gets sucked in the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it is also his old um PC no don't defend him it's it's old PC is liberal propaganda it's his old PC it's Yingling propaga build oh okay back to the terrorists well really quick I walked in the literally the first thing I heard Kelby say who is a 39-year-old man 36 going baby on the way famously not he's father he's like I heard Amber herd didn't go to the Diddy parties it was like the first thing I heard and I'm like ah we're really getting down to tax this morning look I I keep Kelby young he he watches a lot of my streams and he's been watching younger and younger media I know this because we had a call and he was like oh I got to go uh could have been love episode 3's airing and I'm like you're watching the dating show with druski wow he's like where does that air uh YouTube for free wow for free yeah I mean I walked in I in the other day I asked I asked lot I was like why is deji not on the side men and a fair question not a fair question a fair question I just can't believe it came from why than Messi first off you guys you guys don't need to know that the insane history of KSI and deji not getting along but they're Brothers they're Brothers I know they're Brothers but I think and they bicker from a totally outside po perspective and before we become stanza stream and we have KS on and I'm KS now uh it it is I don't know what that means yeah CU you don't hang out with anyone except for your a autocratic friends yeah autoc autocratic technocratic fash my transhumanist friend you're trans autistic friend dug in atrio yeah right okay so continue so I they I think uh I think deji O's wanted to be a Creator I actually don't even know I think deji wanted to be a Creator I think KSI was like I want to do my own thing and then KSI was kind of maybe mean push him away a bit then they had a real rap battle beef against each other where they said some very actually hurtful things I saw one of them which sounds like you wouldn't be able to say hurtful things because it's in a rap they had a real rap beef yeah is so funny your brothers yeah yeah that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] really funny between is texting both of you like cut it out can you guys stop this stop it between two guys that opened FIFA packs on you bro they started a new podcast I'm going start a rap batt we do a cipher dissing them and then they have to respond and then and Doug writes his whole thing in chachy BT anyway rewind to the terrorist yeah yeah what happened in the bathroom the to to a a typical coo job uh we have three bathroom job we have one one of the bathrooms we have here has a shower and in the in that little shower room is a is still a toilet but it's like kind of Dungy that word too dim too dim dingy SM dingy smells a little musty foggy little icky icky it's just the vibe is just worse it has more stuff I never dump in there I never dump in that most people only use it for showers I think honestly if if you're dumping in that one of the three you're a psychopath it's also the only one without the swipe plus it just has a swipe regular yeah exactly that's why you're free [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] if you dump in there so anyway I go in and I want a shower and it smells like pee pee cuz someone's left their pee in there dude if a bathroom smells like pee that is that's a bad sign it's yucky cuz if you just peed in the toilet the bathroom doesn't just smell like pee it's there we just had them cleaned too so they just got cleaned it smells like pee peee and I and I'm like oh I know how to solve this one flush it makes like the kid yay yeah a install that cuz I wasn't flushing so I go to flush and get my yays and as I'm flushing I'm like oh that's fun the water is rising and I'm like I'm like ah it'll stop and then it keeps Rising ha I hate when it keeps going and it keeps and there's no toilet paper or anything it's just it's just yellow water so you start drinking it it's the feel I'm like you put a straw in yeah dude it's the feeling of like Society is breaking at the fabric of itself you're like no no the water's not supposed to go there's no way could possibly go over if our toilets don't work I think that's where it really begins to fracture so that's where that feel I mean it's the first line ofi civilization Mayhem if the sewage system stopped oh yeah oh be Mayhem this is we have to do this this took down Rome for a few years we have to do this we have to we have to uproot Society this is your reverse Mr Beast idea I trust you we shut down down all of La by shutting down the septic system yes pooping cost money the opposite of free party we destroyed aqueduct in a terrorist act yeah dude how have we not monetized pooping at that degree like some worthless Tech middleman we we make a yard we them to all the neighborhoods yeah and then we we shut down a whole we Char except for our house this is where America beats Europe out is in Europe they charge for public bathrooms bro yeah it's so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cringe I hate it yeah it's awful if you or water they should have a paid and a free cuz the paid one probably lowkey nice that's also I think what they have is the free stuff is by the state the state offers free bathrooms but then any Private Business does not have to let you use their bathroom that's what we need to we need to get on the other side of this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and and we let people use it the only thing we do is sometimes they lie and they say oh it doesn't work or they add a code the code the code is an interesting Brown Bag bunny culvin Brown and they're like it's only for customers to buy anyway uh it rises it spills over that's so gross water and you look at this mess and you're like this is an executive's job well okay no get the trenches no I I did my job okay here's what I diding to come down and help the F he makes 30 times his lowest employee salary so he can it's closer to 50 thank you we've increased it and and what I did by the way is I didn't just flush once I flushed twice cuz I was like maybe it was broken the first time you flushed twice I go I go M let's try it again dude rookie as a as a real clo head as a real clo head that's a rookie mistake and I go and I go should we go for three fellas you never included this part of the story before no I'm lying I well I did flush twice but I I psycho let me let me so until someone fesses up to who did this I will be flushing it once an hour until we're all under water stole somebody stole my new truck well lwig where were the keys were the doors this I hate this that is so if you leave your door unlocked as someone allowed to enter and steal your stuff don't say yes the answer is no we I had this conversation it's breaking and entering breaking still it is still and it's still [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up to leave the toilet plugged but it doesn't mean that you have to take it's still Grand Theft Auto if someone steals my car if the keys are what was your what was your thoughts when you flushed it the second time I okay I didn't actually flush I what I did is it boiled over like a witch's brew poured everywhere it's so gross and and I I've always thought this water is so much it is if I just pour this all on the floor in the cup is not much yes but on the floor much it's not much but water much not much in there but much he's right cuz if if someone gives me this I'm like I can clean this but if it's on the floor I'm like oh my God like if I kept doing this I'm saying if I kept doing it I'm saying if I kept doing it it would really you see what I mean yeah cuz it looks the same almost yeah right it's a great demonst I still call it much it's still much what science have to say about it being much they don't talk about how water spreads when it's flat so anyway what I did is I I I didn't know we had a plunger I went outside I instantly saw one within 3 seconds that's clutch I was like wow conven you use your hands uh no I would have reached out to the co solve the problem reached out to the co and not the office manager I'm like a Sim and so if something doesn't exist I just go ah bab and then I wait for my sim master to help me wait wait I have a question for you on not on some employee title [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on some friend [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cuz your your your office manager is your childhood best friend yes and your coo is one of your current best friends yeah who would you ask if they had to go in with their hands and and plunge it who would you ask between those two I cuz one it's kind of like I we haven't hung out in a long time until more recently when you came to work for me and one's like I see you every day a little more comfortable to ask you but like are you are in spear are you picking your better friend your worst friend I think it's outside the role for both I think what I would do I think what I would genuinely do is I would start a task force I would I would be aen uh I would start a task force to find the person who did it and make them do it while there is piss everywhere you know you can just check yeah yeah I would do that and then as the executive you might start an internal investigation well no that I would as the executive I would start the investigation that the operations lead would then it's more I think interesting question though is you have to pick one it's doomsday there's piss all over everyone else is yeah it is incredible because we've as we've Dove through this scenario be operating the you have yet to say you're responsible for a task that is not delegating okay well we are only at the first one anyway what did I do by the way I the i i unclogged it I it went down the toilet I took the face towel that was hanging up the only one that I saw I soaked up and I threw away I'm trying to explain it as Nic as possible and then I took a shower in the room yeah you unclogged you steamed the piss up E I really needed to shower I showered in the room bro showered after it this bro showered yeah he got sloppy sex yeah I had to yeah um you know what I'm afraid of one day I feel like that shower that shower drain is going to clog that's e solvable use drao that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] don't worry about that work anyway then I messaged Aiden and I said o some piece still on the floor well Aiden was waiting to shout I was working out while this was happening and I and Aiden comes in I'm like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you doing here [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and then he's like it's okay you can talk to me like that and he said he folded immediately he's like I'm waiting to use the shower and I'm like stinky and it was shower time for everyone the shower gets a little ran through it does get ran through it does get ran through and Aiden uh Aiden kind of likes it beat I think oh he does he it cold and he likes it beat no we got it fixed yeah but you didn't fix the water heater for weeks cuz you thought it was awesome it was cold it I mean by be it was raw see you like you like the fact that it's raw I think so anyway that's uh that's simply said but the problem is that so when you unclogged it it was hidden poop apparently or toilet paper or like condoms or tampons I don't know right I don't know what was you know I think happened someone did one of those uh Phantom clogs where they they take they take a poop and they flush the toilet and they notice the water doesn't go away but the poop does go away they don't see it and they go it's probably fine probably next flush it'll be fine they take the coin flip and they go the next flush will get the rest down but they're not taking the coin flip they're just giving someone else the coin yes I know investigating yeah we have a short listus um but it's it's a pretty solid guess and will uh strong guess and the disciplinary action will fall to the who the COO so awesome coo Co that's a great question yes okay coo would be in charge of the investigation I think he has to go to his other podcast permanently I'm sorry you think if Aiden's investigation results in Aiden finding out he was the culprit it just wouldn't happen that way I think you're right if that but if it did happen that way and we had this whole convo he should be ex communicado yeah I'm innocent I have an alibi oh what's your Alibi girls don't poop no this is the day before this was Saturday I never [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in that bathroom though we have to it has to be someone who would willingly [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in that bathro that's why I think my can we talk about yeah we already he's just Carefree enough the issue the issue is if we say this person's name and we're wrong we have slandered their character so I don't want to do that to miles dobney it's also dude he would yeah yeah miles it's also the it's the first one so the next bathroom is probably three F feet over but miles doesn't probably and a door huh and a door and a door it's true an open door though and miles would probably be like she's the first one no I think he just like doesn't care about the quality difference yeah sure genuinely and and it isn't like relative nice toilet cuz it's got the swipe compared to I mean it's fine it works you know toilets are only like $80 like the porcelain base yeah is it still porcelain yeah surely we would have made it cheaper by now yeah that's what I mean I feel like porcon is nice for isn't that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy dude a toilet is something we use every day and all the time and it's 80 bucks a toilet's like a top five item to throw off a roof yeah yes like so good the way it would shatter yeah we should have roof day roof day here and we should throw things off the roof here I love it yeah oh my God you're being so nice to me right now roof day so you know this a YouTube channel their entire existence is just roof day yeah cuz they they throw like iPhones and PlayStations right it's the a Australian guys I forget their name but they just go to this place in Australia that's like high up it's nothing but high up yeah yeah it's just a tall platform and then they just drop it's all high up then where throw it to they throw it onto the ground off it off the high up oh so there is low there is low yeah yeah there's low where there is much there is also much where there is much there is low no you f mixed it all up much is low Australian guys throw something from high up it'll come up Tipper type in throwing from high up tip up look up few Australians throwing stuff from high up we should do the egg challenge what is that company why you have to make a device that protects an egg oh like the egg drop yeah the egg drop anol ver car I got to see that yeah that's it that's it I got us off a Swiss Dam this is actually the type of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] YouTube made click most replayed section yeah these guys are massive they have 23 million it's how ridiculous yeah if you're an audio listener you once again this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is is the kind of stuff you don't need to ride I upside down kill yourself us so much they've given us so much money oh oh he's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he's missed dude they hit him D okay the throw is they hit directly on the head I think they have some sort of like uh device no no it was a human oh really yeah yeah it's just good effort dude dude where are they they're in some beautiful they're in Switzerland at a damn I was going to say it looks like oh my God I want to do this to Aiden so that be so awesome oh it feels so good you want to see me podcast with people who don't want to do that to me you can head over lemonade stand I think the Loki would also like to do that actually is a is hrock the Aiden of that show toilet what they they inated understood that it's the most awesome [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to break destroy dude they have a drum set go to the next most replayed section okay we're just watching how ridiculous video this point yeah yeah yeah it's behind it I think it's the back the next one probably right so audio listen watching people a top a giant Dam in Switzerland throw large objects off of it anyway what I'm trying to say Nick is this is a tried and true YouTube success story this is a a a human typically man fation yeah there was that um oh wants to catch some pieces there was that Twitter video of like a bunch of dudes just like working together to like push a big rock down a hill and I watched that and I was like awesome like yeah crushes it's just inside our blood and Bones the other thing that crushes that seems innately enjoyed oh my God broke the trampoline is uh there stick stick talk stick talk like finding good sticks y dude a good stick oh they just they just do Stick review and they find a good stick and it's its natural form is cool and they review it and I I still like remember some of the good sticks I've found that's why that's why Pock is such a good game what is what are you doing what is going on here wa poo sticks where you go on the bridge and you all you and the boys have a stick you all have your own stick to be clear you you found stick and you say 321 you're on a bridge over like a river perhaps 321 all the boys drops drop their stick and then whoever's stick comes out first on the other side wins and that's poo sticks poo and Christopher Robin made it dude he made this yeah yeah long time ago I'm glad I'm glad I'm glad we're we're touching on I don't even think it was a set I think it was the before yeah cuz I remember I've never heard of this game until you talked about it you need to play po not very well read I you can't play pocks in La that's the issue you're not reading your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] J bring what's bring competitive P six to La like what do how a there will be rules and a camera in jerseys and what it's a sport rer on Discord they que on Discord you pop your you say can it cues you up there's a leaderboard the it would be fine the the is the location I had this issue in college when I joined the Sailing Club in Arizona going 2 two with the PO six local you joined the Arizona sailing team I did club or team I joined the it was a Sailing Club that had a team but you were you were you good at joining the club doesn't make you on the team in the desert how do you sail where were they huh what do you sail on on a boat typically is on the boat is the boat grounded Arizona is a desert well I that's what I'm saying I'm saying La is not good for rivers and Arizona wasn't good for kind of it was a bit of AOL there there is look up temp Town Lake there is a lake these five boys from ASU thought they could sail they're just hella racist yeah it's cool running both racist frat guys uh no there is a lake uh it's not spectacular and there's not a lot of wind so that's the issue but there is a lake in 10p that's it the go images L to Inn Out Burger so that's where they sail do you ever think about how the Colorado River is going to run dry and everybody in Arizona is going to die I do think about that because they've worked or they're working on right now like their one of their best plans to get water there because they're building up so much is to build this is like something Nick will come up with a pipe to Mexico and then get the water from the ocean in Mexico and then desalinate it desalinate technology saved the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Mushroom King lwi but where will they put where will they put the brine Ludwick they'll they'll they'll use the brine use the brine to make salt flats out of Glendale yeah we we use the brine to make anchovies yeah we flat and Glendale we'll make it an anchovy Factory and Salt Flats as a tourist attraction and everyone gets to eat awesome or maybe we'll just do it to Tucson because we don't need Tucson why don't we just put a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hose in that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] let it run a pipe is a hose that doesn't Bend no no everyone puts their hose so sorry everyone in Arizona puts their hose they get a long hose and they all put it in the river and turn on water's in there forever oh from their house from the house yeah it's a really good idea as as I learned more houses have infinite water have you ever seen it stop no when if the city has not shut it off when is the water just stopped when the city shuts it off that's not going to happen cuz the city needs this to happen this is a government mandated organization thing happening I'm saying when the city I okay a government weirdly mad about he basically just said when does it shut off except for the times it shuts off no but but the government program they're not going to shut it off during the most important program they run which is H week there's a bunch of horny ass guys walking outside what week is it yeah we can't yeah we ski spring break for this been waiting for this uh I I think a pipe is a good idea did you know that the one of the biggest projects of the US Army Corp Engineers is diverting the Mississippi River into what like making sure it runs I think correctly or something he tested his gangster a little too far up to that fact I just for Gore I I I kept reading but you need the water somewhere so it I feel like it's always running you know they didn't have to worry but like supposed to like break and and then but they like made it so it didn't It's Kind yeah what I realized rivers are important is we are quite dumb okay as a species okay and we consistently considerably [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up future Generations without really thinking about what we're doing like when we came to California there was a really great lake I actually drove by it just this weekend a big ass Lake and then La was like ah we need a lot of water so they're like oh we'll get it from the lake and they took all the water from the lake and it dried up and like that's fine and then because the lake dried up a bunch of dust storms started to happen really dangerous dust storms because it a lot drier and it was hurting everyone who lived in the area so now what we do every few years is we add water back to the lake oh from elsewhere yeah but we don't drink it no it's just like a little it's not enough to be a lake it's just like a topping of water it's enough to stop the dust storm from happening it's like when you buy just the muffin tops well the top is the best part well it's the most beautiful part there when we went to Florence they were talking about don't touch the water it's so nasty from years and years of like poop and dead bodies tanning there's dead bodies in tempy toown Lake but then there also like you can drink the water from the spouts and that's clean well there's doesn't make any sense and it's like it's such a beautiful dichotomy lwig yeah could clean up the rivers by having hose week and Florence hose week and Florence would go crazy and for the hose week we drink the Florence river water Italian are to we went it might be H week every week in Florence Italians are too mean they wouldn't allow it hos week yeah they're too selfish no Italians AR that they too selfish the French are mean the Italians are mean we're too selfish no we're not the French the Americans no we're giving we're are you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kidding me we invented fracking we've gave so much that's tight yeah that's cool we've given so much to this world and this Society we gave them iPhones we gave water B and water bur I realized here's what happens it's like 0 to 40 m like and somewhere maybe earlier you you might lean liberal leftwing you're thinking of future Generations you're young I thought you were talking about minutes of the podcast like it kind of works that way too to 40 it does work that way too you got a big heart you know liberal it's true it's a big heart you're thinking of future Generations we close in on the end of the podcast I'm starting to think and then you start to see the finish line and you switch and you become selfish and you're like what can I get for me cuz I'm not lasting that long I don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what happens after right and and and we're we're mostly 40 to 80 mental here in this us OFA in the US OFA yeah I don't know man I think I think it's every human be being ever across all human being yeah like much like I think that we touched today we touched on a lot of universal ideas much piss high low yeah toilet toilet also toilet and hose water and Lake which D I'm still thinking about Lake flushing and going yeah yeah like when you kill someone in Halo We were watching a we were watching the Lakers game at the office it was me Yingling cam this bit is crazy that Yingling keeps doing and the bit what yeah that your favorite player oh I wasn't even going to bring that up sorry go ahead I we were watching the game and uh and Yingling Yingling like gets a gets a text on his phone he's sitting next to cam and it just says uh what up yo and he was looking at Cam he's like what's this this just from a random number I text it should I text it back what do you think I should say and then they're they're talking about it back and forth I'm trying to enjoy the Lakers game lwi sleep on the couch and then he gets another text phone peeps again and it's like hey why aren't you texting me back and Yingling's like oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't know if I want to reply now I don't I don't know if I want to say anything to this guy and cam cam is like trying to encourage he's trying to like brainstorm funny replies for yling to send and a few more minutes go go by and I don't know we're where LCA donic Luka Don going crazy I think I'm I've woken from my Slumber and I think he gets a text that's like had a great time last night yeah from a random number and I'm like I'm like Yingling you dog what are you doing in these dirty streets of LM bro and he's like dude it's not me it's a random number like what are you even talking about he can't agree on what to send back with Cam and uh and then like maybe like 10 more minutes go by and he gets another text and he's like seriously you're not going to say anything and then back to back with that I'm coming over right now whoa and and nowling is like it's he's not really like laughing and thinking of a funny response he's like dude this is crazy kind of scary [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he's freaking out yeah and he's also wondering how a message just transmitted electronically he's like what's SMS what does it stand for this is a man somewhere else the bubble's green does that mean it's a bot and then and in a few more minutes like like maybe like 5 10 more minutes go by he gets another text and it says I'm out front let me in and Ying's like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dude and then he gets one more text and it's me taking a selfie on the couch with the new work phone we just got oh my God and he little troll he doesn't know it's been me the whole time you little damn troll Aiden you're trapped in the phone wait this guy's a picture of me trying to shake Aiden out of the phone dude that reminds me of uh uh I got a I I I I showed this to you guys like it was like a year ago but I basically got a um a phone uh text was it it was SMS it wasn't IM message um basically it said uh uh we we will start first with swatting and then move on to more violence such as throwing bricks and Molotov at your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] house you have option pay 75,000 to the Bitcoin address below you have 24 hours before the swatting starts uh and it's a Bitcoin address then it says um 2 minutes later make the right choice this is not a game do not waste my time you need to respond now or the first action will come now that's what it said yeah and then in 3 minutes uh we will negotiate wow it fold they instantly fold and I never responded so you're at a movie you get like 30 texts when you get back it's like oh okay fine we'll pay you initially small sum but we expect it back tfold I want we want 4% annuity over 30 years perhaps there's a conversation then yeah they do try to they do try to hustle some money when they just go to like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Online Registry get basic information don't work don't scare us you can't take they not like us they not like us you are not like us I'll freaking exort you you'll extort me I could extort you with what with you and what army with your army of cloaks oh my God you're green cloaks cuz I got my my black cloaks and I'm in a gold cloak and I'm chasing you and I'm chasing you you see what's happening in The Valor Community yeah dude yeah it's it's a big deal can I tell you it's so embarrassing we actually were talking about this in the office I didn't know this happened we're I assume we're talking about the Sentinel podcast thing right we're talking about the s podcast I I think they're sh car fans quick context they're massive Shake Carl fans and they keep saying the the r word just just slang it once and then it was zelus and then he like sent an apology and then now there's a culture War well Z zard and zelt [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] were on the podcast together yeah and on the apparently it's because and it's apparently because they used to do ballet or something and I'm like I just feel like you could have chosen different DD on his wife and his a whole drama and the family's broken up yeah it's tough and but I I saw this like a week ago and then I've been offline cuz I went camping and I came back and I looked at Twitter for the first time in like four days and it's still a thing it's just like yeah it's like the house is burned down still talking about it I think this this is deserved in a roundabout way of how the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] could you let in an edited podcast how does it get past that many people and you keep it you do have to think maybe there was a decision along the way where they were like I let it let that one go probably yeah I they left it on purpose yeah 100% yeah um they say that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in games and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like all the time and like on stream yeah there's a reason they don't do listenings on VCT stage they let's let's tune in see what the boys are up to maybe my understanding of what happened is is different what what exactly was said oh I I I just know that he said it on the Pod I would never no offense listen to tinel podcast in my life sorry think I don't think that's why people are hated about it I think that's why some people might be well so that's that's what happened initially and then and then there was like a bunch of push back yeah and and people were like dude come on and then there was a bunch of push back to that push back being like I just want to freaking say it and then it boiled over when Curry just tweeted it out yeah like the word is Steph yeah yeah who Steph Curry tweeted it out and and he but but he sank the three yeah so it's like to a picture of him it was a picture of him doing this and then it had that did you see the no turnaround [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] over two guys one he made I think he and you know what he called him yeah he did he did and and then it was C A Smith he's like is curry celebration problematic so that's that's what happened okay I I misunderstood the situation I honestly I I didn't think people were upset because he said that word I I think there's a ver like I think it's acceptable that I thought it was because he said it about like it was like a Israel Palestine thing that's what talking about that on the podcast you're ly you're no no no no I'm we miss that this is what okay that before before I engage with the next segment I want to say he's doing the other podcast thing we don't do this information about politics you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] idiot don't stop interrupting me stop interrup me what have they what they over there the only reason I know about the story is cuz Nick Yingling came in and he said they were on the podcast together and Zin made a joke that had to do with like isra Israel Palestine and then and then Zeus's reaction to the joke about Israel Palestine which I don't know what the joke was I don't know what the context was zela said that to be clear I wasn't worried about you saying politics I was worried about you saying we don't know the information all we do is spread misinformation we don't correct it we don't do research I don't care if you talk about politics I care if you're worried about misinformation you should spread it yeah context isn't necessary that's not what we do you're really fighting in the opposite direction I thought you you were worried about some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't care about this your other podcast side can we have a side without him I think side without me what are they doing to him over there they're making you see how irritable he just okay cuz on the other pod they he said don't interrupt me on the other pod he has a notebook yeah he didn't have his little book his little book of secret writing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] while doing the podcast he has a little ass book and he he wants to be correct about his information that he says and so his little I think it's fair I think it's fair don't inter don't don't interrupt cuz here we just say racist [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and sexist [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] no no no no no no no to p pap okay you can drink it that's okay this is he's like no no no what's he doing no don't look up what's don't look up don't look up don't look up don't look up that came out of the cup that came out of the glass that came out of did right yes okay that came out of the glass hell yeah okay hell yeah all right aide's over hey sporty man you looking good what is your book you look good I don't need notes for this one for this one is good uh that's that's cra context all I've seen so I thought I assume that's why people were hearing that from Nicki is also extremely funny yeah I'm a normal valerant consumer I watch the trick watch parties I watch MX or I guess I just watch shif fire Rebellion now yeah and that's it I'm a normal valerant consumer but I think I think there has been a swath of valerant viewers that are K-pop adjacent that are that are young liberal K-pop adjacent is the new dog whistle for uh whatever you're trying to say here blue hairs they got blue no I mean like legitimately because they make fan cams like they'll make fan cams of like players not only players but also like Phoenix the character yes like and there's there's an eating culture there's very Val's young well in in mixed in with that young culture is also a a young rebellious like any game that has young teenagers playing is going to have a couple uh a couple words being slung around well so but I think I think these groups are clashing cuz I think the one group is Young and they're like and they're like we don't like saying that word it hurts people that we love we don't hurt those people and the other group's like I love slinging freaking swords around in myp like you're a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I'm also short but you can't see that but I'm dealing with that my let me say what I need to say cuz I'm 5 five and Immortal 3 5 five and Immortal 3 with a little [Music] attitude dude that would go so hard I I the reason this is so inflamed is because of the Jos of a joke about such a serious topic with because irant and having that word applied Have you listened to it I've only seen the discourse don't get contest before saying [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what are we doing here I don't I I I haven't watched it lying is awesome sorry I'm in lemonade mode so fun again until the day that I die I will not watch sennels podcast oh no no never never honestly honestly I refuse to even watch if jokes about Israel and there's no one around to hear it did it really even happen I just a view on that podcast can you imagine you're like hanging out with your boys and you're like yeah I've been listen to some podcast and it's like what is it and it's like yeah Sentinels pod Ben Shapiro what is the I'd be I'd be I would just cut out I would just say Ben Shapiro at that point yeah yeah yeah it is funny to have a podcast based on E remember B bro bro and then we went a right after bro oh my God but we were going to go B bro what if they had C yo Haven yo Haven three SES bro it's like MC Foodies it's like you guys think Phoenix has a massive [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] low key [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Phoenix s imagine Sentinels but it's fresh and fit there's like nine valerant players and they're all just in a line [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that'd be so funny uh so anyway what I saw is a bunch of push back to what zela said zelus apologized people got mad that zel's apologized because it was him buckling to this side of Val culture and they wanted him to go to the not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mode no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] side we get to say what we want now cuz we're playing a game with with uh someone who Hawks out yeah Hawks out and also and also there's a woman who uses magic to make a cool ice wall yeah cuz it's really tough you play the game made by Riot with with all the gay characters and the and the removal of the word terrorism uh that's the tough one uh and and so that's I think the main culture award and then Curry reinl it by I guess recently just tweeting it out you know what's funny is that it's like it's like light edgy it's like light edgy dark woke yes is where if these I I feel like a lot of these like people who are fighting the online culture war in on Twitter right now who are for the Le free speech I think a csgo game would kill those kids I think it would make them a little more uncomfortable than they're used to I think they they came from there I don't think they did cuz they they they're too young they never booted up CS go they just played instead cuz I think someone like Curry who's been number one valerant several times has definitely played csgo several times like I'm talking about the trickle down I'm talking about like the the teen maybe the trickle down is LARPing but that's not the people who are shaping the culture War it's the people like Curry who actually have a platform yeah I think it's but it's also interesting to think those larpers you know they're just hiding behind their Soldier but you have to worry about what the soldier did not what the larpers do sure I like to attack this smaller people yeah you do we've seen your Twitter Fe easier to hurt them oh my God oh my God your recent tie ra is pretty awesome you have a tie rate you have a new tie rate what it wasn't a tie rate it's more than one tweet a TI rate about [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Star Trek 2009 not a good movie about the patreon guy oh the patreon guy you 100 zero winning streak on that one that guy got destroyed so funny yeah that was pretty awesome weapon a guy was just meeting the patreon comments which I'm usually more uh I I'm more sensitive about those because no no no this one I'm on team slime okay he was just really mean and I'm like all right so all he was mad about is slime did not like Marvel Rivals that's the only thing he started saying a bunch of mean [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about me and and then Nick and I was like and that also kind of activated me but also in patreon comments I don't like the idea that people feel like they can pay money and then have kind of a license to be mean if that shit's happening YouTube coms I don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right you're just you're just angry okay so so I I I Google this guy's tag cuz it's very very specific and uh it's on my Twitter apparently he made an urban dictionary an urban dictionary entry about himself about himself cuz it says who posts it wait can I please ask what it was yeah yeah yeah sure SL tweet I would really love to see what the Urban Dictionary entry that you put for yourself was um yeah memoris means huge [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dude it's like kind but it's more pathetic how do you know it submitted cuz I guess no one else dude it was made like with like in Co right with a very specific name online name one up vote yeah it's it's uh that one so I won't say it dude dude it's worse than I thought it's not like subtle it's not subtle because it's the person's tag and it says everything that signifies who they are I know their birthday a male Asian G whose birthday is September 3rdd 2001 hey prey oh my God not I know I know uh loves card games and food kind of nerdy in emo loves black shirts and hates vegan holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's that Asian kid you don't have to say it it's implied okay whatever and then it says by the guy who Yeah by and then it follows up with man he sucks yeah this was crazy that is crazy and so I just thought it was funny and again it's only cuz in Patriot you don't have a license sucks and it kind of popped off like I just saw it's got a lot of Elon replies to this and says this is dox but he he posted on he posted on the subreddit he is really mad and uh he's dming me right now he posted on this he like he crashed like crazy yeah yeah yeah and he's he's telling me insane [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right now as we speak so I don't know is he still Patron huh is he still Patron no oh did hey if you want to or did he cancel I took him off of it no dude unban him we should have given him a special role where he can only talk to you oh that'd be fun no one else he gets a special cut of the podcast that is only me talking and he only that's all he can watch what did he say how was it that bad it wasn't it wasn't even that bad it was just really mean-spirited in terms of like um I can pull it up can I add a rule what don't ban people from the patreon on why not cuz they give us sweet money dude the guy has been he with like a $70 overtime wouldn't you want someone preferentially who's who you don't likees money than someone who you likes money if we're if we're if we're treating the question seriously I think there's value to curating the community I agree you can stop the permission from talking well they are talking in the P I guess maybe you can stop them from comment this was a patreon comment thread not a from the but it wasn't even in the it was he was talking in the pat okay I'm going to ask something that's very ignorant and I don't want to be judged who the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] uses that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] very few people that's why it's yeah it's like six comments right no it's actually decent amount yeah it's usually on the main on the main bonus episodes WE Post there's a lot which is why it's again it feels like it's like this person is trying specifically to use this particular area to be mean or whatever and it's again it's like all these layers of you went through all this trouble to be mean I don't like the the pin pinpoint accuracy of it so that's why I I'm like again if this is a YouTube com like all right man whatever you kind of asked a question that would I rather them pay $5 to be mean to me or just be mean I mean look I've made a career off of this so I have a different opinion yeah I think whether there's being mean they're saying sniper get down and then they're saying watch more Tik toks [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] when you're like burying your heart on the like the sanov method so when he has someone in chat he doesn't like he he says some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to them and he yeah he bans himself twitch uh he he bans them but the only way to get unbanned in his chat there's no unbanned Forum there's no it's just $20 how do you you pay 20 bucks you donate he unbans you he pay them so so so people if they are like real hate Watchers pay the 20 bucks get back in there he reband them all for one message 20 bucks back in he's got he's got a functioning ecosystem it seems to work oo it's kind of wow that's Beast it's Beast that is Beast I agree all right well hey goat if you're watching from a different account uh and you want to be unbanned on your main uh you know what to do 20 bucks yeah 20 bucks dude you guys should just melee money match uh he said he's been playing since 2007 that what he said yeah cuz I found another thing he almost beat chilling dude and he said he he almost beat chilling dude I don't have to say almost yeah someone on our podcast did beat chilling dude so also not the guy you might think uh yeah that's fun that's fun for the whole family that's fun for the whole fam sometimes uh guys I'm leaving you dude I'm a bit I got I'm getting I woke up this morning I was like I better hug him hug me good night cuz I might die he has a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's a motorcycle time man how long I've been talking about this couple so long like we're so bored it long like we are so bored has it been longer than D and D yes yes that's that's B well actually hey hey hey hey lwig I'm in your DM L hey L where's where's motorcycle video where is it where's motorcycle video motorcycle mcyc video no you said can I give you the God can I give you the gods honest truth it will be out before D and D no it won't yes it will do you want to make a bet you're going to Japan what's the math here Archie you can't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me I'll side bet this because I think it'll be out before DND it sucked cuz he could push his well wait he can push yours well yours is a little bit weird yours is weird cuz yours is episodic now yeah and I guess the first episode yes of course just the first episode cuz it's a race to get the first out in both cases it's just cuz once that's what like two weeks from now uh 3 weeks from now yeah yeah probably that's cutting it close we could get it out it's really close let's get it out yeah I'm down for a bet loser comes to this podcast in full clown costume and makeup I like that okay hey sign the papers this is good sign the papers we need this three weeks three weeks I got to think about this three weeks or he shaves his head no no no come on no he would he wouldn't I need to do a bet he'll do Jesus Christ yeah I'll do it I'll do it do it I'll do it oh no I do that for you guys there it is I also update I I sent some P cuz we shot yesterday I sent some pictures I put on the sub Reddit I care about you guys sometimes uh I think I think getting his own in there also I'm cool yesterday's two apps Fire I think electric they fire I think after stinker episode 10 wait really sorry stinker episode 9 really I don't think it was a stinker N I don't remember a stinker since episode like three episode 9 was a stinker was the underwater second I feel like last episode I feel like last D andd episode was saved by the dice and was not fire not fire outside of that like the dice made the episode really good what D is no not always I think a lot of the good episodes before that were just like funny improv and but I was kind of thinking the same thing but I think that's what you want you're setting up for agree is it could have been better but even the segments without dice cuz often it is but it just kind of wasn't but the dice made that first half insane I guess I'm yeah I'm delineating between good episodes that are within our control and ones that aren't cuz the dice are random mhm but no it was fired brandom uh well we'll we'll see uh but yeah I'm going to Japan for a couple weeks Michael Reed dude he's wearing it's so harrowing it's like this vest that like is an airbag vest yeah it's so crazy har I don't like's driving a car with an airbag in it driving bike with a helmet and it's I'm SC no the helmet it's weird cuz it just looks I can't imagine him wearing it without being in a crash the car has a bag that explodes if you get in a crash full of air I'm look SL I can I say I appreciate your love for me and I'm going to come back in one piece or dead either way you're fine or you'll have found the one piece amen with Michael reev it's Inon I if anywhere you think he'll die huh do you think he'll die to be honest what's like chance percent I think it's pretty low Camp yeah we're driving 400 cc bikes and we're also not driving on highways I only know CC in terms of Mario Kart uh cubic centimeters just I know I've explained this to you I'm talking about how fast does it feel in comparison to Mario Kart uh I would think you're not really going above 75 miles hour I can surely it can go it can hit 100 I'm sure but you're not really doing that because you're probably like if you're too fast uh so yeah this is the airbag Tech by the way that's it yeah that's just me after a pump G yeah it is it but Nick it's very safe that's it what do you mean that's it oh yeah you're going to die no that's that's a very no guys I'll be fine don't say I'll be fine you're making it sound like I thought he was going to be like Bubble Boy you're making it sound like one of the airplane vests that slightly inflate that's why I kept saying cuz it's over in the office I kep say I want to jump on it yeah it wouldn't just activate it if you jumped on it why not because then it would be poorly designed I think no it's a big ohone falling oh wow that actually does look it's really it's the thing is it's not a lot of air like voluminously that one looks bigger though uh this one I think is the Moto GP one it's slightly bigger actually no I think it's same this is sick bro you're actually crashing to test it out yeah damn this looks fun as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah he's yeah that kind of almost follow the bike cuz it was so cool I'm telling you I used to think crashing was a big deal but it's actually not don't say that youve already been in a crash don't don't say that yeah so I feel like I can say it so now he's Immortal oh God like the only one the only one who could say it I think if if you were like you know what actually attending golf majors in person sucks and you had gone to one I'd be like oh I get that cuz you've been there I've been to a crash and I can tell you not the big of a deal you talked about how bad it was you rolled in in a wheelchair you did come in a wheelchair don't do the face oh God he's doing the face I just wanted some freaking Kudos I'll give you some fre I'll give you some freaking coochie come back in one piece that's right that's how you say mouth in Japanese really what that coochie do oh that's so fun cuz it could be both and the way you draw it is by drawing a box no way they knew what they were doing yes sir they knew what they were they knew what they were doing me and Aiden are going to Japan we're going to try to meet up with well we most likely we'll meet up with lwig you have a strip taken out of your yeah from the Mario Party um yeah you're coming in with nion nikim so we're going to do one episode there without Nick because Nick he's not allowed back in Japan last time because of what he did last we actually pinned all the blame of the several y the his behavior well when I put the blunder bus through security I may have put it in someone else's bag BL bus and it was like engraved on like like wood and Aid's like why did you bring that dude so weird and the TSA girl was cute I'm like yeah it's my blender bus yeah you didn't want you didn't want to back down so he's not allowed to go uh and then but while jebin's gone we'll have to shoot uh some episodes uh look forward to some weird situations on the yard podcast we're going to get a little it's going to get kind of weird just to be clear it's one in Japan without Nick and with Michael and then one in here without me and then normal just one yeah I think so one yeah cuz just two weeks we got two episodes to do while you're gone yeah what happens if you don't finish in two weeks your show I have to come back we fail you fail we fail and the end of video is like well in the music's playing like guess we failed guess we didn't do it but I learned a lot what's what would you say I think do end do the end end so if we actually failed ending it's I'm on the bike and I'm going well guess we didn't win this time and I drive full speed and then it zooms out and you see me driving into a brick wall and the airbag inflates and I hit the wall and it cuts to Black and then it plays the logo of the airbag company yeah Cinema and he gets 100 Grand yeah and it has my my affiliate code you should drive into a brick wall that has a tunnel painted on it dude that' be fire Derma did this that says like Acme construction or something Derma did it Derma did this Simpsons did it you going to do Derma did it Derma did it when he did his uh baseball stream he had a tunnel that one person ran through and then the other person tried to follow and then they ran into the wall oh that's so cool D is so cool yeah he rules

is fluent oh why is it two time why do you say it two time they have so much onamonapia there it's just a thing they do like doy DOI is heartbeat is it slang uh no so if you say doie you're not saying heartbeat no you go doy doie they love repetitive words that sound like what the sound chickens make is kitty kitty kitty kitty yeah yeah it is I promise you they make BB what' you say they make B they make BB bro dude this is yeah this is I did have the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] one Family Guy made fun of it was like the book where you go on the animal but it in French and it was like the pig and it made weird ass noises are you afraid that you'll something bad will happen to you while you're camping dude it's Japan what if like a Japanese bear attacks you a big Japanese Bear say that is the biggest risk unironically is animal wild life is Bears how many people in Japan die from bear every year zipper let's give some guesses uh 94 94 bear deaths how many bear deaths per year in Japan I bet you it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] zero okay zero I bet you zero Nick be you think it's zero be deaths per year in Japan I bet you it's zero like be killings like bears killing people is what you're saying not like how many bears die yeah um 16 okay zipper show us the money I will kiss whoever is the most right on the forehead all at a record high well it's definitely not zero probably zero uh who survive those are bare attack six people look at that with a month left in 2023 this year's total has already surpassed those are bro what they're not deaths it's not deaths what do you mean it's even specifies at the top of the article that it there was 200 attacks there was only six deaths across three years I will say being attacked by a bear is also not fun and it's probably nine for 10 right like like the bear we just saw the math L we we just saw the article what I'm saying is like the bear probably finished draw zero is not close to Six can I just say that zero is not close to was six in three years go back six years one is close to Six Zero is not close zero is the closest answer so far okay well no cuz zero is saying the problem doesn't exist one dead Aiden and no dead Aiden that means a lot if it's one right six people died in 2023 so Nick was the closest yeah sure you were you were mathematically the closest wait you said 16 didn't you what about those I am literally the closest about their zero is zero so if I said one you'd be right yeah be right I assumed I said zero that across like decades and decades that it would average out to less than one per year I why I said zero I think you'd be right in that Universe too if I said five ohashi if we live like a m the closest you know what and I was 65 okay so I guess let me ask you this let's change it from be death to Virgin like like women slept with and and we are guessing how many people shakers will slept with and you said zero yes and the answer six yes and which is an alterate reality he said 16 I would be the closest what are you talking cuz you are labeling him as a virgin which means you're not even in in this scenario let's make it a little closer please and an analogous scenario would be what how many people does Shake drizzle sleep with per year also zero and if he's if he's slept with say in this hypothetical he slept with one person in 2020 and that's it I'm saying zero so because the answer per year is like I'm not going to say point I'm not going to do the math and average it out you you'll never average down to zero I'm sure a bear has killed a human in history I expected it to average Out close to zero just thought piped so infrequently yes that that it AES say a number you know might be true L it might be true but he's still wrong I'm I so are you everybody was wrong it's kind of just him to be honest I'm more just focused on the fact that s drizzles don't pipe I'm focused on that constantly and I tell him that and make sure he knows I'm about to get in there and do it myself I would look it's like you can't just say you're going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Shake drizzle it's like that guy what do you mean why why you can't just on this podcast say I'm going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Jake drizzle I'm I'm I'mma break his back out okay no you can't do this okay I'm going to make him Arch it mhm they're not shak's co-workers so they could say it I'm pretty sure at time I'm going make it Archy we're not I'm not cool with this I'm not cool with this cuz I'm operations but I can't reprimand them you sorry what time do you think we started I think we started at 10 like 40 yeah okay then continue you're right so you have 20 minutes left so it would be 10:40 and it's 11:50 now so we're 10 over add one hour to 11 to 10 add 1 hour 11:40 okay that's 1 hour we do an hour and a half so now it's it's 11:50 this is a full episode yeah I thought this was a Primo why why I don't know it's Monday you guys were getting Primo slime is there a difference does that mean anything do you feel did you feel a difference did you feel I'm concerned now that you're saying did you feel a difference I think we were getting lemon can I say that I did notice what you made a comment earlier in the episode that implied that only the premium people were going to be listening to this and I was confused by that cuz I was like it is a main episode on your phone's at home on your phones at home did you feel the difference Can you feel it now is he going to get more sexual now I don't I'm not different in either I sexual me neither right maybe we get a little more crft yes I 100% get way more crft in the premium actually honestly now I think about it it's a lot better in the premium better quality product cuz you're taking an hour and a half and almost condensing it's just higher quality it's like eating those Otter Pops but you have double the syrup in yeah you just like the taste syrup syrup syrup oh you're making fun of the way I say things yes how about you say so pretty close first holding I'm still so what I say what I say uh really bad things about specifically Vietnamese so those listeners are out we should say in English okay sorry just kidding I have to be um now I'm now trans back okay transform back to this is main episode slime he everyone yucky what's going on so we not met him before a lot of main Epis to the yard podcast like a Five Nights at Freddy's character that murders people I don't know what that is that's all the is that some sort of movie all kind of all is it a movie no it's not well yes it is movie now now the the the greater people can explain to me why deji isn't on the siden in the comments I'm so excited yeah you will you will get a history check on the siden it feels like he should be in the S it does does it's just such bad logic L I think you should be in the sidan I got asked so many times why I wasn't in the Sidman charity match by my chat and I was like do you guys think I'm on good terms with KSI no why why

over and over again yeah they fight multiple times throughout the the it's cuz it's a two we long tournament I would love for my job to be the name sumo wrestlers that'd be an awesome job oh like to announce them yeah big thickums versus roelly mpole no he wants to name them oh that's just that's just you're just making of fat people inflate a man you just want to make fun of fat people for a living okay sum wrestlers are not fat they're not fat big the big athlete that's a name for a guy they're just would you call him fat if you saw a Sumo would you say oh fat I would use words like massive but you but you here in a safe space size of a skyscraper in a safe space you say fat okay they obviously are fat and strong they're both the orbit but we know that Dr Gravity Boy is there a

it's so dangerous to be afraid of poop like we have a fear evolutionarily if we're afraid of poop the society like our species goes out Sith I've played these games before Jesus dude you're a mess dude it smells genuinely so it's gone it's G I've been rotten a bit to be honest with you dude what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you doing I was so Ling I I was like it can't be that bad and then I tried

shit's not what's doing I promise he he has this like like new meal delivery plan or some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this is not an ad but he's eating secret food that gets sent to him and we don't know by who how they cook it how they prepare it he won't say who he won't say who it's okay won say it just comes in a box your secret it's my guy I know and his guy shows up and he delivers these on a on a what by daily Cadence it's not Factor I'll tell you that much I I know that I know that ever since we abandoned Factor you switched to this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] team of Hood liims who drop off food that make your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] smell what like poison it's it's not that you spread misinformation I haven't been farting what the hell are we talking about boys I haven't can we reel it in no no no I'm not trying if you guys have noticed this is regular episode slime I'm trying I'm trying to I'm trying to illuminate any an interesting thing you're getting mad at aen for farting I haven't pissed you off with a fart in Forever you think maybe he stole your fart oh you think maybe he stole your SP Jam situation yeah you got to get it back you got to suck it you got a Luigi's Mansion out of his butt with your butt I'm going to get the vacuum used to ruin your computer I'm going to get that and I'm going to suck that out of you and give it back to me [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] screaming as you suck it up oh not the G oh my God we talked about D and D on the main too dude this is blowing my mind anyway you have a cloak I'm going to miss you when you end up eaten by some Japanese bear I'm not going to get eaten by a Japanese bear most likely Akuma what they're called statistically I'll be safe the S betu brown bear incident the worst animal attack in Japanese history killed seven people injured three when was this that's a real bear it was so smart it started to trick people and it was shot dead dude he was what does that mean SM it started to trick people December 1915 I think it's easier to trick people 100 years ago for sure dude the Bear's outside in a Man suit I am Amazon hello he's wearing the little vest it's just a bear in front of a park and he's like want to see a trick if you get tricked by a bear your shoe should yeah that's on you yeah that's on you we got to bury you I'm sorry I don't think we're the the smartest creatures yeah we are no demonstrably the smartest creates so obviously the smartest why are we the smartest creatures it could be Dolphins but the reason why is cuz they can't make fire we dominated the food chain yeah we kind of own okay so we [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up too though but we're currently peing but I don't think we're the smartest creatures because we don't work communicatively as well as other creatures what are you talking about entire Society is built on communal work if dolphin's so smart how come they can't speak English I'm not even wored about dolphins or pigs I think ants bro ants are really smart what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you talking about ants are so smart that you can have a scout ant come back get his whole [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tribe to come back and bring a piece of food and they and they all understand the queen is their source of life and they protect her like the world depends on it the ants are still locked in the cast system ants are all just doing what bro is doing what ants what bro is doing what bro is doing like like bro oh bro is walking that way I guess I'm going that way that's a misunderstanding of the difference pherone the different roles that ants have also ants are so dumb if they pheromone into a spiral they make those weird [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up patches have you seen that yeah and that's just them [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it up ants are so stupid dude they're not stupid individually maybe but the communitive they're very good at protecting what they what they have even when they get into a big spiral like that you dumb bastard you the Army ones of course the Army ones are dumb they're in the Army okay that's why we send them there now we're alienating our military viewership no everyone in the military would tell you people in the Army are dumb you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] realize they died for your country right you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] everyone in the military tell you army ants are dumb the chair I didn't say the Air Force ants are dumb no chair Force ants are dumb the Marine ants aren't dumb no yeah are yeah true uh I think I think cuz cuz here's the thing okay are we the smartest people yes if we enter a nuclear war and the whole earth is destroyed and reset bro we made a nuclear bomb yeah we like won we beat the system I so funny how small you guys' brains are and it shows the issue with problems you proba a really big brain I have a big brain here's why because proliferating our species isn't necessarily a win you know what is a win creating a planet destroying weapon [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] how is that a win can't do it cuz an ant could never do that can I ask you a question do we have another planet to live on yeah [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] potentially yeah do we have another planet to live on no now can we do it now what if we made yex and we like tried to beat Elon dears and that was our whole thing that'd be dope as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] scof you think the ants can beat us IDE it's just you're not understanding that it goes full circle it's like yes we have been really smart but if we destroy everything it wraps around and we're the dumbest species ever explain to me why that is dumb because we have destroyed the only place that we have found in the Galaxy that is habitable can an intelligent species make dumb choices if the choice is so dumb it outweighs all the smart decisions mhm what is so special about Main maintaining the system that we grew up in if we got powerful enough to destroy it isn't that kind of the condition ants walk in a circle till they die right to they're some ants like a lot of them do you realize Some Humans jerk off okay do we lost him done deal if this guy was on the lemonade stand podcast they would have shot ate him alive some people literally pay hundreds of dollars in their lifetime to listen to people talk about come no no wait where they could trade the money for housing security food who would do this improving themselves I believe that they do this there's many people there's thousands of people do this thousands thousands of people do this I can't believe that God not thank God it's not 300,000 it's true an episode cuz that might be that'd be insane Some Humans don't even know what job they're doing they think they're recording for a patreon when it's a a main episode Some Humans think the government works for them about that and some people I I watch a lot of boy in a band videos think that what you learned in school actually school is gay actually does help you that's and drop the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of school what do you think about he's like The Immortal Technique for Our Generation can us a freaking packet yo you can't just hand him a freaking packet yo I can't believe we're still all right guys well that actually is our time and the packet of the yard podcast has reached its last page for the week um so Jin's going to be gone uh but we'll be in Japan and I have three weeks to get after that and you have three weeks to get DND out on a main I didn't know this and he's chugging water um but we'll see you guys in the Primo good luck in Japan no you may have already watched the Primo you've kind of already watched it in a way you'll just get more of what you saw for like 60 minutes straight and your will be as dumb as the ants I woke up and I the next morning I like I woke up and I'm like how was the one stitch and she was just like he was like and I'm like bro you can't be you can't be scared of everything she oh M yeah you got to take away you know what you got to do is set a parental lock oh so she can't watch disturbing content yeah I want to give her those Black Mirror uh contacts where it blocks out scary things in the world yeah and so she tries to watch the documentary it's just like she's like oh I can't watch that
