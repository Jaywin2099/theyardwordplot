you're out there drinking what are you talking get wasted you yeah you're drunk driving you're drunk driving again again again you just came from AA you drunk drove to the office your International you got your international driver's license at a driving yeah they hand them out bro by the Dozen it's so easy what if in the KSI song he was like from the screen to the drunk driving allegation to the ring to what if what if he was that's how people find out that he got into that because he says it song Burger King add that to speed's address bro you I uh I tried the chicken I crushed the Chicken Big Mac before blade it was oh wait it was good is speed actually in a Burger King no no this this this that's a video where Whopper Whopper Junior it's the junior Whopper song commercial except it's like AI dubbed to be speeds like address and IP address no way it's very funny I've never seen the clip is awesome I don't think it's really his information the clip's awesome cuz he reacts to the whole thing like he can't turn it off yeah he's like like gape yeah the whole time which is a much different experience he's pulled up  he's talking about Kat chicken Big he's talking about Kat chicken Big Mac meal which is it's like Pepsi and Coke wait is that why him and and John Cena were eating Big Mac on stream John Cena was there to explain that Taiwan is part of the Mainland it is part of the Mainland here's the thing it's called Chinese taipe you never understand hey when the Olympics are done who gets the medals who gets the medals who gets the medals picks a  side my favorite part my side my favorite part my favorite part about you know my favorite part about the Chinese Taipei or Taiwan dispute is that in theory Taiwan is also claiming that all of China is theirs like in in theory really yes cuz kind of it go it goes both ways and it's way funnier that way they're like actually you guys are you guys are Taiwan you're saying cuz that government lost H you're saying cuz that government lost no cuz neither of them have lost yet okay sure sure sure sure sure sure sure who's to say who will lose it's cuz it's a no there's like there's like a geopolitical reason why why that's the case but they both have to complain CL it they both have to claim that the other territory is theirs so it's like China claiming the island and then the island claiming why doesn't the island just claim its sovereignity that without claiming the mainland also I think that wouldn't work either there's actually enter all right John Cena okay I just I do like the idea of like of like you just put that out there and everybody is like no one that idea yet guy figures it out on the really good idea uh you're going to jail for drunk driving mhm I'm not what why are you

thing get off the list my first that's all I'm saying my first game I got a kill ever that's so good man take it off the list AIO for audio listeners audio listeners well this is the score on Nick's most recent game zero kills 12 deaths one assist I'm not I'm not going to with you when you when I watch your stream cuz I do I'll throw it up on the big screen play on my bro your score is zero on my game on my game machine I'll be playing games watching your stream my friend watching playing video games and you know what when League gets popped I reach for the remote and I stopped myself your ADC you're Lux ADC I don't know what that means jit so don't ever talk to me like that op score yeah so this is a graph of how well you are performing is down or up good uh so 10 is the highest it can be zero is the lowest where's 10 on the list for reference is it down the bottom if you if you uh if you yeah this is this is do the opposing ADC which is the Draven the Draven he four fourth one yeah yeah the guy with yeah that guy so that's that's what he's doing that's what he's doing that's Tyler one's profile picture it is yeah because he plays he's a Draven listen wait click on Alex though he's right on the left side of the screen you know what he's not at zero he's at 0.1 left side bag talk he's at the green amumu guy green green guy green green are you guys going to take the the PGA in the leagues off the game list is zip on the left side of the screen click on bag talk yeah man it was like it was dead ass fun to watch you guys struggle a bit I want you guys to just beat the challenge now I'm kind of sick of it it's more like like we can't beat it now we got to beat it in six months when you fire up League I literally I reach for the remote and I stop myself and I say it's my friend I like watching him and I have to like consciously say like he actually did decent 5921 third place like he actually maybe knows what he's I mean the the other scores are 051 02 kill bro he has 21 assists you know with me bro with me and Bot I'm assisting his assist though you know what I mean like I'm getting like half the damage he's getting like the last tick and then they're getting a kill real real  real real real they're real real real they're doing different things take that off that's tough bro it's awesome so I had an AFK so you can see just one more last number to look at uh they show laning which is basically how well you did as opposed to your lane it was 29 to 71 I had an AFK in my game it was 28 to 72 don't burst your lips like L I'm kind of it's kind of getting me though it's kind of hot dude also what you just said it's awesome it's fun that's a lie I watch your stream we ha it it's our favorite game to play you're on it and you're like this sucks I'm not having fun you literally change your mood when you play league involuntarily yeah I think you guys don't run it I don't think it's like an ineptitude issue because you guys like you're very good at games I think you're just genuinely not having fun and running it down cuz I see it was only that game we've tried every other game and also Alex was in a weird mood dude he kept throwing and being mad he couldn't come and he couldn't bust I'm like is it cuz I'm not pretty I can't sometimes that happened with Connor sometimes really that's a communication thing you have to tell him that hey if we're getting angry we're playing worse and we need to we need to re the other Conor again God damn it so lover vers World Challenge cont I know but I switched what do you think outside of game what was the biggest thing you changed till get you to victory I think it was literally having a sit down and being like you we're not it was I was off-stream messages on stream we said it it was like we cannot tilt okay because it kills the vibes yeah we're here for fun anyway yeah and we play worse so what is it achieving right it would also help to learn leak a little bit I can't do that no probably not for real dude I think you should learn a little think he's right probably not just last hit but I'm buying items without reading them and then asking what they do you didn't have boots for like 15 minutes yeah it was crazy I showed up in margel Started From The Bottom I don't care what bam is up to he smokes crack now yeah dude he looks crazy I just watched a video with him like it was posted like a week ago is he still playing tricks on ape and Phil he looks crazy not no no that's done but he lives in the same house you think ape still gets so it's like damn it bam you're smoking crack in the house which one of them is a pedophile uh that's Don veto he's dead real holy he's dead he's dead rest in hell with Steve Jobs he was the greatest ever to it just there's just a big fat pet fck my big fat oh there's bam damn awesome poor guy have you seen him skate he can still skate it's awesome love that that's muscle memory this is one to one what my brother looks like

half a half brother real brother he's he's he's not but I love him and I think a half brother can be a real brother and you can also be disent in a way that makes you feel like it's not a real brother but at the end of the day I don't think Bloods makes Brothers cuz you guys are mine what are you looking away what is that what's the pose I don't know he looks is this a pose to like end your sentence okay so Co forgiv you for everything beautiful to me you guys know what I'm sick of wearing these  tight ass rash rash fueling tight ass rash rash fueling diapers and I need something I need

anything about making me wear the diaper who's to say why I'm wearing the diaper diaper but I'm sick of it and if a bully had a different thing in his hands to put on me at school at recess what would I want it to be I want it to be you in that scenario yeah AG is this happen a lot does The Bu no one is asking about how frequently the bully puts the diaper and or other things on me but I would prefer if the diaper used me undies oh okay if the bully used the bul instead of a diaper instead of the diaper that he currently puts on me now when the bully puts the diaper on you do you use the diaper as intended that'd be a waste of a diaper would it be okay if you use some of the the versatile little sort of loungewear they have off if the bully had joggers in his hands perhaps or even a hoodie or a onesie to put on me at school in has all that getting packed up and put into a onesie when the bully when the bully  lifts my feet up like this to lifts my feet up like this to  put the on

you're saying though you were literally like yeah I hung out with him and it was like he was funny and it was cool oh my goding you're taking it out of context for a joke and I get that but you're also lying to people on on stream right now we went to we went to the blade concert and then we got in and out and then we went to the Rose Bowl was shopping and you know what creaming with my boys was actually chill as it's actually chill I look when someone comes I I like said I make time for them and it was I think you're bringing up that you hadn't hung out with someone in a while I've never in my life in real life that's the interesting part you piece of  it was cool to see a reflection of it was cool to see a reflection of you and them as a from the past because a lot of the jokey things that you do they do I read all that but then you're also like yeah he's cool cuz he's fun and funny and it's like yeah your friend's fun and funny like what dude I met him for the first time in real life do you know how weird that is that's I met guy who I've known for 14 years who I've never talked to in real life that I used to Skype every day that's the interesting part but you don't read your DMs so you just thought it was something else that's the funny part we could all agree to keep ganging up on him he can just lose this what I wanted to say was uh something that uh was really funny but I forgot cuz you made me crash out so I don't know what to tell blades from Sweden was the blade concert good everyone knows that was it smell did it live up to the expectations let me tell you let me tell you the truth drain up for one drain to my till I'm  dead what okay I you have to ask dead what okay I you have to ask what draining is I'm not going to explain it to you this is like last even I am going to ask what draining is with young merch Go's gone to um no I was going to ask you what once you explain this can you also follow up with what the happened on Twitter I heard you got shook down by drainers on Twitter or something what the are you talking about uh he was think he talking about your Tweet didn't oh that wasn't a drainer that was just some guy who like had a schizophrenic episode and call called lwig Israeli yeah a drainer he wasn't a drainer that's the thing they all are if they talk like that uh no I I went it okay real smells just like combo breaker not going to lie really bad so not good really bad it was like that's the joke everyone's like oh blade fans it's going to stink it did that's crazy and I was like that's crazy I didn't think I I was like that's overblown but that's okay I also understood the youth I think in that snapshot of a night someone was dressed genuinely like Sonic from Sonic Adventure 2 not as a hedgehog but wearing a lot of the same items that he would wear and I'm like I get it I understand the culture cuz like blade and like young Lean by exent it like kind of sucks like the music but like in a cool way right and it's fun and easy to admit that and be like yeah I listen to this suck ass music I I love young lean I've listening to Young lean since some of these guys were sperms yeah and I'm like yeah kind ofs he's been around a while yeah he's been around a long BL been around a while well not as long not as like big not as big but yeah a long time then why does he got a bunch of young fans blade was making music when he was a kid Blade's 30 bro shouldn't hey like a punk b or some when he was a kid um and so so I was like it was fun to just be there and uh I got it I understand it I get the youth touching grass what you were yelling at me about just now touching grass is nice cuz I did all weekend and I'm in a great mood I know so you're right I know and he's mad at you I'm going to disappear for 14 years and only Skype you and then you'll  be like damn hanging out with be like damn hanging out with dub is actually sick as I love that you're actually a little jealous hanging out with dub is so cool that's what it is oh wow dub is in to we should go to Universal thing that I'd rather kill myself than do but he's in time I would is that not normal to be gone for you to notice I'm here and that's the thing about it is let me tell let me break some down for you Jin we are holding each other in contempt for that we don't do anymore every one of us is changing for the better but we still act like it's this guy from three years ago so we need to move on and we need to stop that cuz you know what you asked me to go to Ben Schwarz I went I didn't want to go and I'm like of course I'll go I'll hang out with du and I'll have a good time we'll cream out we creamed I hang with my boys I do but what I'm saying is you have flaws that you have worked on no okay everyone here has flaws that they've worked on to get to a better point but we still on them like it's the old days I hang out with my boys that's real we I'm not talking about that God you're not you actually have the same claws real though not engaging that is real we've all gotten better no but that's real I don't even know what you think is real  in this context I'm kind of keeping in this context I'm kind of keeping it aund you're not keep 100 keeping a 9 9 no it's the worst case I know because most of it's true but then there's a 1% so yeah go leave for 14 years I'll hang out with you yay cuz I did hang out with you last week and I liked it don't you see I'm trying to change yeah I we should because the yard will probably end like you know in like maybe 3 months yeah say we should uh we should do like a yard like 10e reunion podcast like when we're all older we should come back and do a single episode you guys are all bald we should do one a year when it ends the yard retrospective yeah that'd be kind of fun one year one a year oh one a year oh that's kind of fire because every 10 people are just going to forget yeah and like Joe aanga will be young forever I think we're going to pay to have him Frozen so he get him that we unfreeze him every episode got he's got to send my kids to college to be honest joea will stay you till the day he dies he'll stay de four uh I went to a concert

bunch of people were going from uh Mogul UT's going was trying to goite went uh and then me Shay and go cutie went and then there I didn't ask I just bought tickets like I've done a stream with him but I just spent so much on ticket they're expensive well the day they came out they were expensive I spent 3K oh my God how many tickets on four middle VIP front row tickets I okay wait what what account does that 3K come out of oh you're me you're me from the old days I'm turning into you I'm like me me me and Y were doing like an audit last night and I was like wait a second it actually came out of my personal but it should have been business it should have been business cuz I am making a short from it you might be able to write that off that's true uh but but two things happened first thing is I got a shout out on stage mhm oh that's cool you did not know who Porto was three years AG he should have brought you on stage to do your song Do you believe that uh now I don't cuz you said that thank you did you did he did he say he missed me he missed when I went cuz I went to a show a long time ago I think he was thinking of you for sure he looked like he was thinking of you the whole time uh zi I'm going to send you I got to send it I forgot to do that I'mma send you the link cuz someone recorded it and we have the exact moment this is yeah I I tell until now I thought this was like a a TI International um true sight thing where you just learned about jerx and now jerx is your favorite DOTA player but if you  with Porter before that this is with Porter before that this is like a dream come trune no I with him before three years ago I think he was that's when nurture came out he was just number one on my Spotify wrapped because that was his new album you're a fan I was a real I'm a real porner head that's so fun uh porner and I'm not a I'm not a I'm not a what do they call him I'm not like a a globe cuz he has an album called world would disagree and the people who only like worlds right so guy with guitar uh all right press play nasty why does he have an acoustic guitar doesn't blood play electric music it's like a mud or something it's fck okay why does this make me mad I should be happy for you 20 people oh yuck well let me repeat what he said he went he went I'm playing this next song if it's from a game you might have heard League of Legends cuz he he made a song for League okay right and then he continues and he goes I Peak silver one but right now I'm like bronze three so yeah kind of like lwig wow dude he roasted you and the most hurtful thing about that roast is that I'm not even bronze 3ze I'm bronze four that's crazy I'm a lower rank than the rank he made fun of me for being and he's busy and he's busy and he's busy and he doesn't give a he's on stage being busy and he's a higher rank than you uh and then we got  up cuz yingo and Shake were up cuz yingo and Shake were playing takea sip every time someone asks for a photo oh that's a that's brutal a conc concert Jesus Christ at a poral concert I said I was going to Bro kill yourself percent it was so we had like six beers and then cutie shout out cutie got the manager like I guess the Porter's manager came up to her she was like messaging Porter's partner too and then uh wait did she ask to see the manager no no no he like came by because menu's too loud uh but got us to Backstage to go hang with porner which was cool what was that like I've I've done like a couple streams with him so I was just like what's up but it was cool for like Oto and what was being was AO like I made Porter Robins Soul that's how I introduced him yeah that's that's fire and then he was like yeah and then he pulled up some nerdy and I walked away he's like check this out yeah I got this stuff going on you like left them to play mat did you meet Mion I heard Mion was there Mion was there he did he did perform apparently Porter's on some uh streamer life because he asked M on to perform because they have a big song together yeah and then forgot that he asked him to perform and then Mion showed up and then he's like and they didn't do any audio check or anything you have to prepare for things and and then he was like ah let's just rip it and they r ripped it and it was hype okay but he did sound bad dude M on did yeah that's so awful I just don't think he had like an inar so like he's singing the song and it's just like a little off like we could tell it was off but it's like who cares he's here it's m dude he's like you did you speak French to M that was what I thought I didn't meet him I just heard like a waste of  time was was time I got to see time was was time I got to see that was my first porner concert you could have been messaging Aiden cral details and said you wasted your time getting drunk with Shake again I got drunk as yeah I CED a okay brother what I'm saying I'm still drunk I drove drunk here yeah when you said you were late cuz you were at AAA I said goofy uh with three did you think that was funny nah no no because I've been doing dealing with Goofy awe comments all weekend what oh T cuz lwig trick Invitational was run by Sentinels and they were like oh we need copyright free music what should we do and then I was like I don't know figure it out and they're like oh we'll just use the lwil musical Emporium music and I'm like sure but then it's like Bo and that and the like five minute interim period and everyone everyone just is making goofy a comments like like like wake up going to the dentist a day oh bro you're getting on what is epidemic sound are you boycotting it what the I'm not doing I don't do that my A's on the mass head I don't do that you're too busy bro you're too busy you're too busy to make decisions that people just like pissing me off it's on my job there I show up I say what up what was it like what I heard Leo went the guy who runs the leag dude yeah yeah that was funny you should have went you should have fought that guy you got some say I don't Leo fario was there he's very nice he's very mild mannered which was he was a sweet guy that's good but uh he's the guy who makes all the decisions as far as valerant Esports goes which you tend to agree with a lot big decisions they're big ones he he's powerful I think he's like number two oh yeah there's like Anna who deals with like all of valerant and then he's just VCT you also don't like the format yeah I've out him several times on Twitter you piece of your mind well I talk to him and like he would like give like every time you ask him he gives a very you know thoughtful answer very like he very careful and it's like yes so like we have to be considerate of this and that and so then at a certain point I was like well probably not going to discuss our way to like relegation so I just start I just started shouting out after a while so we there' just be like I I feel bad I was I feel like I was putting him in a hot seat oh cuz he was on the broadcast while you're doing this yeah and I'd be like you know someone ter be like oh man he got I would be like yeah like Leo tier two like that yes and CRA we have fun here Leo I'm playing around dude why aren't there any Chinese teams Leo Leo what's your body count Leo is Taiwan part of the Mainland you think oh oh dude Riot would R would put they would detonate the C capsule in his mouth they would you bro yeah cuz I found out that I look I don't know how legit it is but they were saying that the viewership for Champs this year was three times last year 9 million viewers EDG Won Chinese team probably because they say 7 million Chinese viewers tuned in yo what the it's like turkey and for reference Masters last year when uh EG won was 3.8 that's so interesting they wait they there are Chinese valerant teams yeah now there is I don't know why you said that yeah there are they and they won jams the the reason I said that is because benai Namco had a bit of a scandal there was a Tekken tournament that happened two weeks ago where there was a player from China who got through and got in like top 16 to earn points and get in the finals and then they dced him because China is not allowed to compete in the uh Tekken World Tour finals for whatever reason it's like sanctioned countries like Tekken sorry Russia China a couple others if you're from there you don't get to represent your country wow and they let this guy go all the way through stupid dced him out of winners and then losers and everyone was like what the going on this guy just wants to play Tekken right it's just a normal gamer I mean bro they figured out they figured that out for the Olympics I know like the Olympics you can still compete and so they had to like do this whole apology post and it was really poorly handled they're worried about the geopolitical implications of r games is the opposite to be clear yeah no no I I agree I like to make fun of them I think they're pivoting to maybe an all Chinese roster that's Beast their F should Riot X Crossfire uh yeah let it bang a dream yes I want to be an anime made te- posing while I op mean League World right now watching that game is crazy dude Crossfire watching old Crossfire is so funny is it electric yeah it kind of is cuz it's just like it's like watching CS 1.6 but with it's just it's been it's like yassifieds and all the animation and sounds are just so weird and funny and you can be and you can be so many things rather than the standard CS model you play it after your factory job in in ganga you chain smoke at the cafe and you  boot up Crossfire and you don't boot up Crossfire and you don't play Crossfire HD we should click this whole what's the percent of smokers in China what is it high it's got to be high high I don't know is our assumption do you think they they've pivoted to zins I feel like maybe yeah I feel like they're on that Vape wave 25.6 adults in China smoked in 2020 50% of men age 15 over oh in 2018 men men that's crazy okay that makes sense 2.1 of women age 15 and over in China smoked so half of all dudes almost no women why we got to make get more women smokers I think they need to capture that market pink sigs y That's your solution yeah and they taste like strawberry that'd be so fun and cool and on the side they say girl bossing today what's our breakdown by the way Chinese ours of 15% women is it 15 still yeah it's always 141 and then the rest is male 141 male the rest NB yeah we have a we have the non-binary world Community behind us because of flood weg's publicity stunt a year ago it it's a it's a pink cigarette on the side it says men's tears y oh that's  beast mode I love it yeah my beast mode I love it yeah my grandma smoked them thin ass ones cuz she was like evil she smoke the Cruella Dev at the end of like a like a little didn't have the thing the plastic filter that's only for French people but she did smoke the long ass weird do that either they invented it they don't do it they also invented chopping people's heads off they we chop it off it it come done I'm pretty sure the guillotine is very French Guillotine guillotin I love how you said it and then I was like it is aen word CU you don't pronounce the L's it's like Jean Pierre that's not with wow good good call good looks John Pierre yeah with the L's in it I'm a

like I can do that I'm like cool okay this isn't like I'm not like challenging you here but like Ted would walk up You' be like that's not too bad I'm like okay thank you he did do that and then he was like I can't do another and then I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm just going to put my shirt on I'm just going to try to close this out that same thing happened though when I worked out at 10:30 I'm like ah it's 10:30 all right it's chill I'll just  bust out my workout I'm doing bust out my workout I'm doing legs and then every Smasher is here because they all hung out with Bob burquest all day from the noun thing on Wednesday can't that's a real and they're all just walking out and I'm just sitting there squatting and they're like oh and every person who comes up is like they're doing the math of how much weight I'm lifting is that a lot and we have two different 45b plates that they're all like 45 35 I'm like it's 2 45s I just trying to run through that's so funny so wow you you're getting bothered while trying to get big for ter just trying to get big you know you're trying to be not for for me want to be bigger for T this is thing by the way dude by the way after doing it I like this look at this God body like after doing it Kelby was like ah bad news Riot said it was a little graphic we can't air it and I was like you dumb he forced you to take it off and he didn't clear it with Riot they said it was too sexual not cuz I was shirtless by the way cuz the choker it's a leash when cats wear them not tired of that that was more it's cuz that it doesn't clear the tens boardroom they they they pushed it they pushed it they they they went they stacked but you pushed back and you won it's on the broadcast yeah yeah I'm saying they they had to fight for it but initially it was a no a choker is not a uh most men and some women agree that wearing such a necklace suggest submission I think a choker is sexual okay so every pet has a choker to animal a frr Source yeah dude sure that's French people yeah let's trust the French they would know they would know about sex everything's sexual there want I don't think Callen pie it's delicious I love it you just you just sitting waiting like what's the first  what was the practice of what was the practice of the car for today yeah I think if it's if if that's sexual then all of our pets are begging for dick I you know what I'm saying this is logic have a was submissive submissive outdoor cats are free thinkers I think I think it is true that a caller would make an animal submissive but animals are not SE sexual because okay so now animals can't have sex cancel it cancel cancel the animals because we as humans aren't or shouldn't be attracted to other species I agree right so then it's not sexual on an animal zipper this is not helpful that's AI overview says yes animals are sexual animal say when when a human wears a collar it is suggesting the same submission that it does when an animal wears it but in a more sexual nature because what is a human submitting to another human well if you're a man why would you submit to another man true you are seual because it's sexual why are you as a man talking about sex why are you as a man having sex with another man it's your gay your G in the same in the same tone as why you as a man eating fish yeah it's going back around you you know I've been reading that K makes me sad is that college kids right now they're like they're just using chat GPT like crazy to do all their work and I think about it and I'm like that's kind of sucks cuz they're becoming like really stupid but then I think about me and how much I procrastinated in college I'm like dude I would do that too too also it's also like what they what we were being told in school it's like don't use Wikipedia or cheat or whatever like cuz you got to learn this is the same thing it's just more streamlined well Wikipedia was thought just to be a bad source of information I more mean like cheating like like don't cheat because you won't learn anything you'll just pass the test this is that but faster and better and harder to detect yeah it's kind of spooky cuz you think about the kind of people were minting because I think Chad gbt is more so it's like yes we were told that but there's a difference between asking the robot to do all of it for you you know there's a apparently there's like somewhat I bet AI is good at going against it but there's somewhat decent Detectors of if something was written with AI or not right yeah and you have to like use that to grade your  now yeah I saw a tweet from a she now yeah I saw a tweet from a she was like I I'm a professor and most of my life now is just seeing if it's AI which feels like a waste of teaching people and I think that's as a as someone who for writing it's like oh that does kind well the art is Hood knowledge you just come here you treat in school and then you come learn from us we Lear from us the four of us can teach you everything that you know history PE uh probably uh French French class okay yeah I got you got youen class and gender studies gender studies the four classes that's all you need that is that is the right wi's biggest nightmare is when that becomes the four Topics in Florida schools history lunch wait what was you're you're quoting like an old meme that's like this this show taught me everything I need it's uh I didn't realize I was doing that but you're right it's the Tweet that's like uh like yeah I'm in school it's like uh fortnite PE some like that uh something like that yeah but we can we can offer you all the education we ever need you ever need and I'll say this AI will never touch what we teach you unless a could never make the yard AI will never touch you like we touch you we'll touch you good you'll know the difference between a robot touching you and us touching you with our minds don't be crash we'll touch your mind freak touching the mind we'll touch the clitteris of your mind is this sexual harassment see his fingers I'll get in the little folds of your gr the little God my God I'll flatten them out there is a prostate in your mind and we are massaging it okay we got there yeah oh you'll get there anyway what you guys what what's on your mind what's on your mind guys I missed everyone I miss I'm leaving for a week ask

Robinson sound does a sky voice line it's five you know what's funny is I learned about an NBA young boy song from fortnite I'm learn everything is happening backwards for me what why are you guys doing this don't make that face come back come back come back what the  the problem isn't this what they the problem isn't this what they want problem isn't it what NBA young boy wanted was for me to see Peter GFF I think NBA young boy wants you that's not true that's not true don't say that don't put words in young boys young boy could want him for sure never broke again broke again don't say like that but why why would he not go on fortnite if he didn't want a fortnite player base and the fortnite player base includes people all sex and Creed I saw buff Peter Griffin saying right foot creep and then I listen to it in the shower what were you doing the dance in the shower somebody come back come back come back you me you see why the photo you sent me of your of your countertop I believed that was you you see why I beli did you play fortnite I didn't I watched Nick play yeah oh you watched them I watch my streamer play right foot creep yeah yeah yeah it it was cool I mean that's sorry I'm engaging with the world around me we cannot win a game of fortnite it's tough our lobbies are hard bro that you know what the secret is what's that not playing fortnite you need Ro more you play the I'm saying you're doing this picker wheel thing which makes it come up more the wheel's hype though when you played it early you probably just were winning no we haven't won one oh really oh then you guys just maybe have high rank or dude I literally we don't have any I don't have any bots in our games and I just get killed by a guy that says twit Shot TV his yeah there's no buzz okay all right the her are coming now what else do you want to say to her you get you get into hurtful mode yeah dud it's because I love when people fail this challenge cuz you know everyone was coming at me they're coming at me yeah but hurt people I was rooting for you when you were doing it hurt people hurt people you hurt people yeah but you're hurting the person that didn't hurt you yeah no what is that I'm trying he's being T Stark boosting fly dude I was I've been watching starting five the Netflix documentary about five NBA Pros okay and one of them Anthony Edwards is a big basketball player great name and and he's exactly like xqc really yeah like he has minmaxed his life just to be really good at basketball but can't do else does he look like XC or something no no no he's he's just a handsome he doesn't look like he doesn't so what why C no one in the NBA looks like x no one looks like you don't get the NBA looking like EXC there's got to be some tall Birdman's the closest he's not tall for the NBA I know but like you know what I'm saying like Okay go on way the the scene that cemented this in my mind is it's his uncle and he's packing a suitcase and he's like got to pack two suitcases one for clothes and one for video games a loves his video games he's talking about his nephew Anthony Edwards and how he packs his bags for him and then Anthony Edward in the interview he's like yeah I don't know why he packs my bags like I've never been good at packing and you know shit's worked out for me and I'm not going to get good at packing now but I don't know why he does it I think he likes it or something and it's like obviously no that's so fun and then it's the uncle he's packing the game suitcase and he's like can't forget the cables forgot the cable once never forget theid it's like and it's like kind of sad CU like so you got chewed out one time didn't pack the cables it's also funny cuz he's a father yeah Anthony Edwards himself yeah wait is he yeah he is he's a kid I don't think he's a kid he does I I like the idea of uh he does zip can prove this well the thing is I think when you have a kid who becomes a  NBA player that's like the dream NBA player that's like the dream if you're a dad right no no I'm talking Anthony Ed oh is his uncle uncle you have a nephew if you're related to an NBA player you feel like this great sense of like yeah he he he very much clearly loves his family I think the difference between you know him and X the one difference that I could identify X makes more money is yeah CS that's not even true CS dude X the president X president Trump how about that definitely not even true X met the goat and clears in cash ban for ban right now I actually is how much is it close no no they make that much money Anthony Edwards makes so much money the face of he's the face of American basketball right now he's like such a hot of the new generation of American basketball sorry he's Mak up he am I smoking pot a 5year contract descension that's worth up to 245 million yeah he clears I bank that where ises to AI on the Timberwolves I dude I love AI the yard will always feed you Ai and I've always said that yeah now he does used to mean Alan Iverson now what's it mean that is true that sucks sucks bro although I guess AI was also a thing why aong like what's that Bruce Wills movie oh wait that's what the song is about I was what what kidding oh my God I was like you saw you got me out of silly mode almost Le he almost leaped across hit me it's just so believable he go he goes I'm kidding when he leaves he's Wikipedia dude some guy iers some guy in my chat last night was like can you play White Iverson and I was like normally I'd be mad at you asking me to do something but that's a good idea so I just blared it I think it was a lot louder for me than it was for stream cuz it was so loud that I couldn't hear Alex anymore and I real I was like happier that's bad dude I was like I was like they need to go to therapy Rel fun when he's not flaming me for doing better than he crashes out so fast and and Nick just wants the game and Nick's trying to keep I would say Nick is trying a lot and Alex just needs like this stamina they need to talk they need to talk about what they what was like you guys need to communicate when we were like in that second league game and I'm like brother not the problem here a lot more layers before communication going on dude people just desperately desperately in chat saying Nick skill your W put a point into it he had three on his Q two on his e and then one on his R and his W had no SK just wasn't using he watching a violent car crash and every detail dude I'm doing what San told me to do you don't San San should not say don't skill point he he said he said do your e all the way get R when it's available no no you're misunderstanding got it it's all right Mis how cuz what you're supposed to do is you get all the Spells and then you do e as much as you can and R whenever you you can right so you need at least one point so you have access to the spell in the first place I I don't even  it's okay it's okay just take it it's okay it's okay just take it off F I won't I won't I cuz lowkey I I was like I wasn't even hate watching I was like car crash watching and it's like like I enjoy it cuz then sometimes they win what do you want from me you don't like when I'm good at games you don't like when I'm bad at games oh I got to be average games I like way to do sure D I don't like it Sherman Oaks Sherman Oaks y'all fry rocket League oh my God yeah we do because our teammates are opponents are Bots you every time you think back on this challenge unless it's PGA you obvious have a sad look on your face no it's fun I enjoy it when is this going to stop you know when we win when you win going to do it until you win I'm going to make a trailer for every stream Jesus Christ dude zipper 2 is the one who's hurting the most from this no babe please it's actually it's actually got a great effect on the relationship because I feel so guilty for how much I'm playing League of Legends we hang out way more that's so beautiful it's working out all across the board I just don't make any his life it's fine right now yeah yeah you can't you got to pick two of the three yeah I'm definitely at an alltime low misery wise for sure but the challenge is fun when I'm doing it because I can't because I can't feel any of that and the world kind of melts away leag of Legends has a cool way of making you ignore that you don't have any sort of like passion or that's what's going on with you too what you're trapped in the you're trapped do you see second second second second when are you going to come out I looked good I looked good yeah in bronze 4 the goal is platinum bronze 3 now I actually did level up after the porter concert I'm just worried about you guys no I'm actually not worried about Anthony he's getting out there and socializing Bal we're doing a great switch up yeah you're worried about me I game I think I'm the most worried about you literally you're drunk driving everywhere you're going to AA meeting I'm going to Japan wukari Masha to  explore the explore the worldi type explore the world hanashi M type that's the the drunk driving capital of the world Japan actually I think it's 0.00 it's yeah no one drives that's the funny part the salary men can do what they do and live the way they live because of the train they get to drunk commute it's so much cooler than drunk driving yeah that's so hype they play their switch they play Fire Emblem go to work for 10 hours and then get blackout dude I'm following this hor horrible Tik Tok it's just this Japanese salary man and he posts his day-to-day life okay it's so sad it's makes feel good feel good cont makes me feel so bad what is it is it like those Day in the Life edits where he's like and I get up at 6:00 in the morning and I and I go to work and it's midnight and I go home it's silent POV just him walking it's like I'm up at it's just text it's like I'm up at 600 I have to get to work at 9:00 on time is early in Japan that's herro and it's just like the community is like my work is very far and it's like Joy I got off early today and it's like 6:00 p.m. and I'm like ah he's like grabbing a quick bite to eat so many options sore food 7-Eleven onigiri delicious I love it he's just getting home at midnight and he's like I'm not able to afford enough from this job to buy a home I hope this changes and then the video just ends and I'm like ah Jesus Christ and it always ends it's like Japan is much better to visit than live I thought that the thing about salary men was that they make a lot of money no the thing about salary men is that they have a very secure job it's almost impossible to get fired you give that like a purple filter some speed ramping at a net spend song that is a pretty hard Tik Tok Bart Simpson pfp yeah we're we're cooking deep 808 that'll be the ad Camp cool you go sample that culture you take all you extract all of the good from it you say wakari m you stink up the RV with Connor and then you come home meanwhile salary men like that are suck  Walman in an RV and I'm taking Walman in an RV and I'm taking their culture like what are you talking about you know you can't even book hotels with two men no oh my God in quite a few areas in Japan you know what I heard they say gay but my Max he spent like two years in Japan he was telling me people cheat all the time on their uh spous not called cheating what's it called it's not like a it's called sexual release okay no this is this is you guys sexual release on your not not a this kind of not a meme this is I was sexually releasing if you go have like it's it's somewhat normal if you like go have sex with like a prostitute and you like pay for it your wife's like I think it's common to stop having sex with your wife after you've had children cuz cuz why cuz you had the kids there's a there's a cuz war zone 2 came out bro War you got to cook yeah this is a Wilding it does not these are Japanese women being interviewed by Takashi this is so fun what a fun place God it sounds awful here how how expensive is a plane it sounds terrible to live here uh it's like an apartment expens it's not it's not it's it's not like everybody agrees not good if they hide it as long as there's no feelings for prostitutes it does not constitute this this is probably curated as well but it probably does represent somewhat of a cultural idea that's so fun it's okay if he pays money yeah isn't that wild like well you guys are going to pack that RV full of prostitution is that what you're doing dude you're going to Japan for sex tourism no I think differently of you now that's why you got that gu who teaches you Japanese he didn't just teach you Japanese huh he taught you methods how you so much that's so fun
