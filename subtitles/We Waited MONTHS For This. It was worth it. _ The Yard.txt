myself now now I'm allowed to defend myself you're going to determine what it is you're it seems like you're choosing so should I address you or the guy in the adult pajamas which one uh adult pajamas speak to directly talking are you sleepy do you are you are you on talking about me this is good outfit I look good right now sexually speaking I look very good and if we were to rank us sexually speaking I would be one sorry bro this is okay so this is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] because when people visit me or visit the area cuz he's here for uh to go to Twitch young in San Diego and he Matt the other guy from Tekken call him Matt now do you his name is Matt yeah me and Matt chill that's his name this is a different person Tyler this is a different guy does he have a tag Matt man yeah okay so call him by his tag you can't say you can't say that's his name some people some people call you Anthony and you go don't use my name it's not slime but there's there's a difference between the name and the tag this is insane we crazy so I so when someone comes like my friend uh Max who I met through DOTA 10 years ago is coming to see blade I'm going with him when people come to the area and they're like hey can we hang out yes I will partake watching blade is something that you would do normally no different blade to the audience he means the artist Blade the drain triner blade made the movie I thought they made a new not the Wesley Snipes movie I thought they made a new thought he was coming down here he was back that's okay you know what not an unfair thing to he's a little back Wesley Snipes spoiler well spoiler or Blade the movie I don't want to spoil what movie is could be a little spoiler if they haven't seen it were you spoiling movies oh Deadpool yeah it's a Deadpool spoiler well we spoiled it now spoiled did it myself so so when he's like yeah you know we're trying to go to Universal do you want to come I'm like yes I will make time for someone who is never here to go and this is something I do normally it is I I don't it doesn't matter what it is if it was Disney I'd be like yeah I'll [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] go and you guys are acting like it's some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] solar eclipse of the Apocalypse you won't come hang out at penis star league I don't like penis star league I'm bad at those games you like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Universal Studios you get mad that I don't go to PSL huh I I what is it what is it why don't you want me to be a PSL you don't hang out with us and then [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] brawl Pro comes off and then you're like how can I suck the schme if I haven't seen you in a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in months and you're like hey I'm in town do you want to hang out I be the podcast for the next four episodes okay good good then then you'll realize cuz then he'll actually hang out with me what is the problem I need I apparently need to be a way to get hangout rights this is crazy this is crazy I need to be for you you don't consider this hanging out do you this is work I think that's the difference I consider it hanging out you're sick for that and you consider it work you're feel you feel like a girl you're SI is he not sick for that it's funny cuz usually this is the opposite is it not this is time that I I cherish but for you this is like lights off like 3 minutes and you come in my ass us hanging out this is us like being together in the same room and I guess you don't that's what I'm saying you don't ackowledge that you don't acknowledge that oh my God time versus quality time versus quality time thank you cuz there's such a thing as quality time and there's such a thing as regular time and this is regular time okay to look escape the bit slightly for a second here do you realize when we hang out and you do something hilarious and it is goes uncaptured I feel like this should go captured so when we hang out and something funny happens and you and it goes out to the world in the medium of the show that is fulfilling to me do you not understand that's how my bra does it for Content he it's not about content it's about sharing you're a Content guy I like doing stuff for just you content guy you speak thumbnails I don't hear it if this thing all crashed and burned I'd still be fine hanging out you guys want go with me to Universal [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] no those guys are fun I don't want to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ever meet this BR dud I was do you want to go on a date with my boyfriend yeah that sounds awesome you know I was thinking cuz I said I said this in the group chat and then you were like L we said in response to this that is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] insane it is the I thought the same thing okay so it's is saying that I'm going to see blade even though I don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he's visiting I've never we never hung out in person ever I think it's just insane that you will be at a blade concert understand the reason I don't really care but I'll go with my friends I think music is less weird cuz you really like music but you just don't like amusement parks at all I think they're fine I don't care about amus Park you lasted two and a half hours if there was an amusement park across the street from my house I'd be like yeah that's way more tolerable it's like having to go and be in the Sun and jerk your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and have them like scan your carer [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] there's a lot of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] going on for by the way called it to a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] te cuz cutie Cutie was like she was like you should come to Disney and I was like okay well I would have to get there around like 8ish and she's like yeah well Sim will last the whole night I'm like I don't think you will I don't think I think what'll happen is he'll be there and then eventually you'll go to a ride and they'll be like after this ride let's go I didn't do that you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lied you said she told me I did four rides it was on camera the whole time who to be clear I did not say one ride yes you just did you literally just said that that's not what I said so you guys can listen to what I said or you can make up what I said whatever you just say first ride R he said go to a ride but I don't think he meant one ride I didn't I didn't well when you say go to to me fun that Aiden added first to a sentence I didn't say that's fun ride wait does that mean you added the word when you say go to a ride does that mean if it's the seventh ride and I'm 10 want to go home what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you even saying I I think his point would be there anymore she said you were going to last a whole night and I said at one point you were going to ask after a ride you're going to say hey let's go after this right you're going to pick a point where to exit I'm in I'm in Swedish mode uh like a and one are the same I'm in Swedish mode there's no are you not are you not Ain Ain right that's a Swedish a swed I think it's like a realistic thing for him to he's finished anyway uh you were half right like I I lasted

some Street in Anaheim or something like that ringler tweet about it yeah no it was like the man equivalent of like throwing a ball for a dog and like not actually throwing it saying you're going to

you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you got it FS a lot to be fair uh huh a lot that's pretty true that's true I have a oh let me see if I can find oh I don't know does Rich know how to put [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sh she kept asking me some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] too dude your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] girlfriend dude she kept [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] saying some ass [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] where she was like are you mad that you came are you mad you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mad and I was like no I get to hang out with my friend all day it doesn't matter for a Disney yeah you tricked me into hanging out with my friend oh I'm

your friend video games that's one one of the like doing you that we usually hang out and play video games the thing we do you do you want me to go to PSO yes that's why BR up constantly he go no no I don't want you to come to PSL no I'm asking you cuz actually I want you to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kill yourself with a gun you never that's why I'm asking you he being me is that what I'm like yeah unreasonable someone say I wouldn't say that you sound reasonable than me uh I I okay well you know what [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm I don't know if I'll go I really thought that was like I can't believe you want me to go that bad when you never reached out for Gen don't care I genuinely don't even care that's that's the real answer I don't even give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's the real [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] answer you obviously not I don't go all the time but I have fun when I do I have fun was fragging out in Black does he ever tell you hey you should go to PSL he's fying uh no but that's cuz I already am in the chat and respond and go sometimes oh I'm not in the chat yeah in the chat neither's Jr dude a lot of people don't make the cut the Jr is not in the chat Jay's not in the chat no he was on stream well that's exactly what I said that's what I said who is JR the women have taken it dude it was a it was a SE they kept there were Whispers they they kept talking about vssl vssl and I was like what's going on and they're like no don't worry about it don't worry about it it's our star league vagina star league has started up and then I come home the other week and I I accidentally interrupt vssl which is the assortment of of you know zippers they made him strip naked and dance they made you made and they threw Tomatoes at me you had to get on the table and they play poker no dude vsl is poker they're playing poker at vsl yes and it's girl poker someone loses the hand they all clap for each other shipping it in on [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 4% Equity hitting your two outer and going yeah [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and they can't even defend themselves cuz they don't have a podcast nope [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] go boys uh vssl you know what I hope this has inspired people at home to start their own PS or vsl um I think that'd be that's that's a fun idea that's like makes me feel warm inside what blood WAFF [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you saying it too like what like you haven't even gone you don't even go they do it no but I talk about it a lot I think something a trend that I'm noticing right is like he said no to the basketball cuz it's a slurry and it's not really hanging out yeah but then psls arrived at the table you know that's another slurry perhaps I'm saying consistent what do you want me but how many how many slurries before it's just friendss hanging out yeah it's a good question Ed that's actually a really good question I think again to escape the bit for 2 seconds the half bit because a lot of this is true I I have a I have this idea of like you show up for the important stuff you go to weddings you you make time when someone's like in town birthdays in some cases uh uh and and the rest like if guys if we didn't have a show where we saw each other multiple times a week I I would hang out more but this this is beautiful to me I'd love this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] maybe you guys don't love it as much as I do I love this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] here we go I love this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm about this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I think about this all the time love I love it and that's not how you feel and that's okay because you're dressed like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yacht referee I don't like that I don't don't put that in your mouth it was in plastic it's safe so big though dude that that mouth just tracing the outline of Minnie moue lip it looks like a toe it does look like a big toe don't do that I didn't like that I'm just doing things with it when it Wiggles uh yeah man I'll this podcast year probably so what if if PSL was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] if PSL was a Tekken local you would come oh it's such a better drive than the normal ones yeah TPP TPP oh if I mean we if everyone was playing Tekken and it was PSL crew yeah you think you'd be the worst player at PSL uh was I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know I know I don't know I don't know Disney that GNA be well as Cutie going no I was going to say well is is is qen on a good podcast or is it a bad cuz I've heard on a good thing or a bad podast I don't even know I don't know they're probably on the RSS wave so uh I don't know wow okay a lot much to think about here I'll tell you what I'm one of the worst players at vsl and I still have a good time at PSL I'm also one of the worst players at vsl bought them bought them on both dude I got extra like I got [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sent to my room I like that yeah yeah dude it's good that's like when me and Nick had boys night we were cussing a storm yeah we're cursing I walked in on boy night wait what is boy

we were watching a music in descendants 3 which is terrible God so but and uh he walks in on us watching a musical and we're like it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] boys night what are you doing boys night we were cracking open a musical in some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] spicy water maybe actually you know they got uncomfortable cuz a man walked in that was what it was sorry sorry I interrupted boys night then you brought your H yeah she did come in pissing me off I uh total piss it I I have I have a huge [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] issue that I've created by this league arch of mine yeah dude wait what's the issue everyone's playing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Le leg I'm losing thousands in company time oh no thousands upon thousands upon thousands mck Yingling is already bronze three yingo has put an insane amount of time in already he's a higher rank than me he's getting boosted by [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Shake drizzle why don't you get boosted by shriz I don't get boosted it's against my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Co guy whoar guy who literally literally after that that which was two years ago has done nothing but [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] solo and refuses or dual a stand who's worse than him worse than you in val sanses by Rank and by performance Yeah by all metrics that one would last night last night Stan someone asked Stan like what's your valent Rank and he was like diamond and blood from the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Rapter oh once so he's not Diamond now and he's still he's still claiming that that's fine yeah yeah he was like he was like he phrased it like oh I I peaked diamonds okay okay like low Diamond it just funny to be like for one game bro he did sneeze on it he did [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sneeze on it and then the blow from his sneeze blew him back to Plat so wait do you oh so Yingling has no qualms about being boosted by Shake drizzle the the master uh what was this guy this is he used to be a master player Shake's also he like he's not working out anymore yeah he sent a message to the group chat for the editors me it out it was kind of funny D cuz I see when he plays you picking up the phone with the glove is so funny I see when he plays cuz I have like we're friends on Discord so it'll be like Shake is in the game and I'm I'm up at I'm up late last night cuz I just hanging out with you was like 3:30 and I see and I see Shake in a game 6 minutes in and I sent him a message I'm like go to sleep go to sleep man are playing at like 5 it's crazy this new Discord feature it the it's it NS so hard Josh called Shake out which is funny because Josh also plays a lot of league so you know if Josh is identifying this it's it's a lot and then this and it's 80 hours I think more than 80 yeah cuz he has like 160 games in the past two weeks or something crazy oh my God it's a it's I don't know the exact I don't know if you can pull up rich op.gg and then Shake drizzle but we can see the exact amount of games anyway he posts in the group chat goes I would like to apologize for my league relapse I couldn't live with myself being placed bronze not playing any more games till I finished streamer games edit also uh and then he just talks about another edit but he sent a group a group apology with all the editors in it for his League time it hasn't been bad we've been fine on the upload frequency because we had some other [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but yeah he has been addicted all this is bad cuz it's affecting the company even I'm like I'm on I'm on the uh outer rim of this I've booted up for the first time in a couple years let's be honest you're part of it part of it yeah did you not boot up a four in the office silver zoom in it shows it right there it's the recent game it should show like recent games and total amount I can't see it cuz my eyes aren't good like that if you hold control and scroll in part of it part of it's a strong accusation yeah scroll down a little bit zipper's not here today that number that number the total games it says recent I can't see it though noes so he's silver to 77

trip he's like isn't he like diving into it for the first time diving into being schizophrenic like I was just want to see what it's like not that bad let me just give it a shot's not that bad I like RuneScape but you grew up with it yeah it's true dude league is taking Nick Yingling away from me from Cod ranked we were duoing oh my God he was so sour for boy KN and I don't blame him I get this way when I lose a couple games but I come I come over for boy KN cuz we're supposed to decom and he was in a game I I walk into his place I'm just stomping cuz I know his girlfriend's gone I'm just stomping around saying boy night I just want attention and he's like mid right game mid right game I'll be out like 3 minutes like 3 minutes I'm like boy night boys night boys night I'm not going into his I'm not trying to bother him I would love this by the way this would be a treat for me I would love this I'm not trying to bother him and then he comes in and he's like we got to watch the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] descendants tonight I play [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] four rank games in a row [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lost them because people are leaving and I can't do [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about it and I'm like boy night boy night you know you got great energy I had a guy I had a guy who joined who joins the game and he goes anyone got a mic and no one responds including me because I'm I'm music on mode I'm chilling no one really Cs and ranked if you're under like Crimson so I'm just chilling and he goes okay and from round one sits in the spawn doesn't play the whole game that's he throws he throws the we haven't even lost a round yet he throws the entire game because no one responded am I wrong for saying that's Beast I don't think it's Beast you're wasting so much time a little beast how is it Beast of course a little beast happened to me because he's so principled that that he's willing to lose his own rank for this and it's a good principle of communicating gag was Sk8 life skate life and on our team a random we were playing with was named olly and the other team is making fun of us cuz we're getting [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on and they go oh skate life and Olie a match made in heaven huh and they're making fun of them he's not even responding cuz he's AFK this is I think it's Beast cuz it's also not like he's throwing a bronze game why are you as Diamond game and being unwilling to C why are you as men wishing to speak with other men online that's true actually [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] got you there true brotherly woman cuz maybe on godod R who only plays with one girl that's crazy yeah and then so so he was just in a foul mood he was in a foul mood which wasn't it was he he was just mad at everything that he would normally be watch a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] musical slightly mad at but it was just more mad we're all becoming we're all becoming each other you're becoming you're slime's becoming lwig lwig becoming slime you're becoming me and I'm becoming you how is he becoming you cuz he's doing a lot of gaming and I'm not g not Aiden works hard and I'm I'm still you know I'm picking up the six here and there but it's it's record low gaming for me right now record low gaming and so we're all turning into each other yeah PSL has ruined my mind po p poison I game all the time now it's fun I it's funny though because Friday like the PSL attendance I think was low or something they're like is PSL [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] washed dead dude they it wasn't even low we had a we had full team all night then why were you I there's people who are depressed about it doting they're like what do we got to do to like get people they do they do that before we even play they show up and they're like is it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] done I'm like no we everyone's here we're about to play what are you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] talking about me when we only get 200k on a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] podcast I think that's why I get so mad because it triggers that wait how am I becoming lwig I don't think cuz cuz I hang out with people and I want your attention and you seem to be a you want to hang out with streamers cuz they're your best friends yeah you hang out with this guy cuz this is it's literally when you used to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yell at me be like Coral Jam is your best [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] friend content time content time counts as hang time yeah the thing is yes thank you nobody you ever idolized back in the day [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] atrox STS [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Carl Jacob's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] quit don't rub your clears stop it they were never never as good at Tekken oh Mickey as BR Pro as a uh and that's the that's the Pepsi difference I would say that atriarch was better at a game than brawl Pro is at a game dude I don't think so Starbound gotcha what is Starbound it's a game that H was the number one player used to be so good at League okay I look I'm not going to sit here and say oh you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this my friend could be your friend in a game off game off uh yeah I also realized Sans a gam I guess I never respected him as a gamer until yesterday oh CU of Halo dude he's playing Halo he I like I've played Halo and I know the maps but he's like going purple two purple pushing purple gold gold his CS were amazing his comms were electric and and he was yelling out everything perfectly and he was just slaying out he won against like I was like damn [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you got it like that you know what I think that me and Sams are similar in that we're both bad at games um and but we also value calming a lot cuz it's something we can innately like do initially well he's a he's a peak team player for sure yeah and I think I share that with him cuz I I would play valerant and be like my comms are Immaculate but I can't hit [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right well you wouldn't say that but you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you say his coms are Immaculate I think his death coms are good yes yes when he only is thinking about comms are great but when he's alive it is like Marshall out [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pushing C this is exactly like Dark Souls there's two on B come on dude I wouldn't say that in the call no but you're thinking it I'm thinking it cuz it is it's just like it when the wolf gets the sword in his mouth I'm I'm bad at the good player thing which is um you get killed and then you Cal first and then you complain yeah I I do the opposite where you complain then you Cal it's really hard to reverse that I get beamed and I'm just like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] God damn it all right 2 a this is you yesterday Halo dude I was getting slammed getting so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ruined he's he's playing I was like go2 just go he's playing horribly and then at one point he's like God I wish I stop getting third partied we're playing 2v2 V2 V2 yeah man that is how it goes man what you signed up for a it's so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] annoying uh bro the god gamer gaunlet I'm doing is ruining my life yeah you're you're like far away from a dub I know and we're like 60 hours FY him in fly him in get in the same room it will solve your problems it'll it'll fix the marriage it if anything here's the issues I'd have to fly to him CU I'm already going to Japan soon oh yeah so but I don't want to go an extra week cuz I can't it's just you know what would be hype you know what I thought of would be hype for a format for this this far into it it probably doesn't sound very hype because you just want to be over but if you get through all 10 games you have to One V one each other to determine the winner of the challenge one of you win so okay so we started this God gaming Gauntlet it's been picked up by a few people now the biggest one is Papa plot the German streamer he's been doing it and he he got like 57,000 viewers doing this with his bud and and I'm watching and I'm looking at the games list and I'm like okay Mario Kart they have to finish first and second okay that's tough against against field and then and then I'm like okay that's tough and then they got like like a I think fortnite I'm like cool and then it's like Euro Truck Simulator what I'm like okay what's the win state I know and then it's like higher lower like the Google game and I'm like okay what is this just flipping a coin halfway through Mouse list we're doing here you got to make rules like Doug made for the rules they exist the rules are 10 competitive games against real people and then you have to have two BRS and that's it Euro Truck Simulator is actually huge in literally European countries but I don't think there's a maybe don't know what theate is there's a head-to-head where it's like drive a better route and there's two people and it's a multiplayer you have to swap [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that'd be cool do you remember the subathon when I played truck simulator dude this is what I was thinking of dude parking those trucks oh it's hard it's not I watchy on Tik Tok it's what he does exclusively he's like a truck driver and he gets like and it's just a parking and he boots in he's like oh yeah going to have to be a k turn here and he just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the physics are like it's like those uh the non- neonian fluids that you punch and then it doesn't sink oh yeah it's like that but for parking cars it should nothing works like it should when you learn it though you seem like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] God anyway we challenge them to a 2v2 oh sick when we both complete it when we all four I guess how do you pick what game to play at the end of it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we'll have to do a mange of both our games I suppose big ping is going to Big ping will be brutal oh yeah cuz you're covering the globe between that group people yeah yeah but we make do you think me and Alex can do it uh I oh of course you can do it I also think you guys have an advantage in that you are lowkey smurfing a lot of games lowkey because way you're highkey smurfing lowkey it's kind of high how would it be smurfing huh how would it be smurfing I think he's just saying you're better than the games you're being placed in at the moment because he can't cue with Alex in a lot of the games in rank so they can't have to play unrated you'd have to come down to his level you're playing a easier time than it would be if you both were playing games you both play I see and also I don't think you guys are going to get stream sniped as much and that's what really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] screws it really stream yeah yeah I guess that happened with dude even when we did the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fortnite yard experience we were just it was dude every time I've never seen Connor crash out so hard he's losing it he's like figured out how to block people on switch my God like low tier God he he knows the exact like like movements in the controller dude he he gets mad he got mad and there guy who like cuz there's guy in Fall Guys Who sniped us which was really bad and he it was a team game and then he threw on our team oh like push the ball end of the m and he's just like no I will not push it I will push it opposite way they'll do anything bro they'll do anything for and after that like like something broke in his brain like he he was like he crashed out he's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and then the guy who he bans on switch comes into his chat and they're like he's like I swear I just happened to boot in I didn't even know that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dude I ban him I ban him wow I look man I don't even know how to unban on YouTube on YouTube is fun cuz when you ban someone they don't know they don't know it's a shadow ban it's a shadow B it's so it's so delicious how does work it's you user hidden from Channel so other users don't see them but they're just typing typing wa comments same wait that's sick with YouTube comments it's the same you can hide user from Channel they will continue to comment on your video that's so genius cuz then they don't make a second account oh that's on Twitch it's like you are banned and it's like submit on ban request and on YouTube it's just like should do that with like their family members too they message like their mom their mom just doesn't get it do they think they're messaging her that is a Black Mirror episode that is the da Draper one you become a right-wing Creator [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Shadow B your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] message can't be spread anymore yo that's what they do they put the muzzle on you and Joe Biden [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and he licks your ear and he says go to sleep Trump got [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] shot at again yeah what a flop assassination attempt dude funny is I went on Reddit and that's where I found out about it cuz I on Twitter in my phone okay you yeah you look awesome you look good we like it it's like dude imagine the Patrick baitman [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you know I see on Reddit that he got assassinated but it was sunk under six posts of him saying Taylor felled off dude yeah that was a way bigger news story than assassination 2 everybody knows that Trump doesn't like Taylor Swift anymore almost not as like half as many people know about the assassination too that's why I'm saying it was like it's such like a flop era of like assassination 2 was the guy was also in a video with jidon yeah I know isn't that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy for real yeah Jon just walking around a college campus I don't know where somewhere north of wi winry and this guy's just handing out flyers he's like Join the Revolution and Jon's like yo how's it going and he's like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with him instantly he's like I don't do paper but like I used to serve he apparently I heard this on the daily this morning apparently he went to Ukraine for a bit to fight yeah oh yeah that's what the guy was he was like he was like Ukraine has the right to defend itself so that makes sense he you know when uh when the war broke out there were some like weird American guys that just wanted to go fight so they'd fly over and then they would like try to join the Ukrainian Army this is like uh what's that guy the poker guy during the Vegas shooting did you see that video no Dan bazarian or ban during the Vegas shooting that happened he was in Vegas for the concert and then he there just a video of him live streaming on IG and he goes up to a cop he's like give me a gun oh yeah I remember dude that is and the cop's like no like leave obviously and he's like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like I'm trying to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] help the cops d oh thank God you're here here take our gun take our Gun Guys Dan's here Dan here Dan here we can all leave yeah beard still looks the same Mark at the plane it's also Vegas like he should just have an assault rifle stra to his back they don't the laws are crazy there they don't care uh yeah they I think I saw the jyon thing and I was like the the what is it the line ooh so strong wow that's the strongest hands I've ever seen on a man looks strong man the line of poke man to Trump getting assassinated is so short what like cuz Jon pokem what's your Trump assassination number yeah mine's too mine's too I met Jon yeah you're so close oh wow I won't lie I just I I set the balls down and there was only three and I was like he's doing it but it fell off it lit if you look at the camera I freaked out I was like did I do it there was a crimson blur's birthday this weekend and he had a little gathering at his house oh Crimson blur the famous cheater and slly famous slay the and on his girlfriend not kidding not this is a truth podcast tell the truth and by the way Nick before this podcast real quick was like was like yeah apparently blur is a slay the Spire record but like I don't see like a video of it like there's edits like there's there's full let me say what I say let me say what I said I said I'm in to SL the spirals ton I started playing recently it's fun and everyone in my whole life told me Crimson blur he has a slay aspired world record I'm like whoa he's the go that's awesome I was like I want to watch Crimson blur vods so I or not vods but I want to watch his like videos of this game and speedrun so I look up Crimson blur slay the SP and the only things that pop up are like 8 Hour raw vods and I was saying how come no one makes highlights of the one of the best players uhuh for a game this big and then you got to the concl I went on to conclude maybe he's in a Mickey Mouse category that no one gives a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about did you watch the vods uh I clicked into one VOD and it was like 20 minutes of him saying nothing and I was like I'm not doing this so you clicked into the thing is I know it's real cuz I watch it live I remember watching it live no no I think he got it he got it I think he got it in Mario fourar but you have to play you have to play with the Xbox controller he's saying it's a lame cat it's Mickey Mouse I'm saying it's Mickey Mouse cat you looked up what is Mickey Mouse have to say I'm doing what you do never [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] call [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Mickey Mouse again sorry I'm sorry it's not Mickey it's bad connotation that hurts our reputation a hurtful a hurtful stereotype and nobody's ever died around me ever families and if they did it was really close to the place where I live but it was off site legally distinct over the line from where I live especially if they signed up for Disney plus what happened at the birthday uh we a bunch of people that were at that party were talking about burning man because they had gone and one of these people uh who wasn't at the party but had gone was dwan shroomed and apparently there was a melee tournament at Burning Man did he form and shroomed won the tournament on like flat screen like shitty TVs and the guy who ran the tournament coincidentally messaged me today and reached out and he's like hey I have this like incredible trophy from berning man and it's like this huge structure like built out with like LED lights and it looks incredible and he's like I have no way to contact Dean he won the tournament I think you might be able to get a hold of him like can you help me deliver this to him and I was like oh this is crazy that this tournament that was being discussed independently like this guy who knows me from like either the yard or smash reached out to get Dan his trophy and from the melee tournament they played star League winner stag give it to me I'll give it a corporate 40-year-old board on life [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Trophy and give it to starle T let's give it to it let's give it to amsa let's give it a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it well no Zayn zay's not going dude you could have done you could have lifted a finger to try to get I think I dm' him maybe I think I DM him May that's strong for me more than he usually gives us I think I'm pretty sure DM are you come to St league and he said I'm trying dude he said dude I'm trying he he fought fire with fire he not trying man yeah I don't think he was actually trying but that's what he sent me he's down 07 to Austin he's not coming don't bring up [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] records like that disrespectful [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] disrespectful tuck to my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] down 07 toza and he's not coming 07 maybe he's Mitch Bade Mitch there's still time Mitch respecting what happened to sfat sfat he's just taking a little break he's gone to stuff this year is that cordoni he's he's he's living his healthy vegan life yeah he was always doing that he's strong as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] did uh did danan win like uh at the tournament just like a big sheet of acid like a thousand tabs of Rick and Morty it's actually no just water R play for water it's like it's like the future in 20 years it's still kind of cold he's just chain grabbing to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] survive here's some ice for you who do we send in if we if we if we need a melee player to not lose a single stock vers and and it randomly generates their opponent and if they if they lose a single stock we don't get water anymore as a as a society who are we sending in it's not mango it's not mango I don't think it's Juan it's not Juan either cuz that that person just might be up like slaming up on the I feel like it's it's a random who they who they play against it's zaye bro it's a random yeah it's a random who you could just be any guy be any guy it it would have to be zann or amsa I feel like I do Josh man for the fun of it cuz I I know he'd make it kind of fun it to can't be it have to beza right Z no cuz if he gets his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Armor broken off stage or some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he just dies he's so hard to kill for the average person engage with do you think it's harder for amza to Parry someone who's like terrible G just has no clue what they're doing there's like no reliable timing you have no idea what they're going to do yeah it's like the the the best swordsman in France doesn't fear the second best swordsman he fears the worst swordsman I've heard this it's like lein no lein then maybe should be I was going to say is trolling I think just used to be the guy who' like proudly forck people in pools and tweet about it yeah yeah he's pretty consist that is funny yeah he' be like yeah just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] didn't went through pools without dropping a percent get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] everyone like his attempt it was like how how hard can I beat the people I think go Zay or June Buck June Buck DK's don't SD man I don't know what it is yeah that's true was lay out what if it was one of us population have to send the Chic in yeah no he doesn't want the pressure he doesn't want the pressure you play Falco which is dangerous you can't send the fal I've done this before I have I feel like the the way Sheik plays the game it's actually kind of hard to like really dominate bad players sometimes like I If I've played somebody who's basically never played before I have an easier time [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] them up with like fox or Falco cuz they're so overwhelmed by the way those characters play and like the thinking man's character but she is just kind of like run around slow so they put out like random moves and then like when like when walie like like to you know took me to last stock in one of the games we played yeah I I like the idea of dubbing yeah I four stocked him the Halo guy the Red Bull guy yeah took you to last St can he l cancel uh he plays melee yeah okay yeah Walsh she do you know who do you know who he lost to right after who the one-handed Peach not the one-handed Peach so wal she lost a one handed Peach but took you the last St to be to be clear I for stocked wal she the first game we're not talking we're not sending you out for a water we can't send for a water clearly we can't it's already say should we need water the que H Rock would eat you up Eat You Alive wal she was talking mad [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to aen and I was like sit back down you're playing [Laughter] Maria let me show you what I've promised hon we sent out Maria we might have to up Mar the one-handed Peach to defended Peach was losing stocks she loses stocks does wait does one-handed Peach get double water yes oh it's it's a risk it's like uh it's like trivia mhm double points I like the idea of dubbin doing it and then it's it's the last stock he's at like 80% with puff something could go wrong he looks back at us he looks back to the world he said this is for the water wins whiffs arrest dies dude that' be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fire so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] love that that's that's the thing he Farms the clip and then we get so much money that we buy more water buy the water water from us we got to talk to them honestly I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] went up against this guy with Connor in bralla who plays with his hands and his feet at the same time control two guys 2v2 but it's oh my God it's just one is that his thing or is he Beast uh he's like really like mid with the feet and his hands are decent but he lost that's like the I I saw this is try moving you know when you like you Circle your fingers try moving them in the opposite direction it's so Harden you're just no no no no no no no you're moving think about it you're moving them the same way right now you're just I'm defin this is moving them the same way that's not the opposite direction so look

other day is he's going anti- casual Friday that's cool actually he's like showing up he's like I know you guys are trying to take it easy today I'm trying to work harder we should do the anti- Casual Friday club and it should be a merch a merchandise company and we it's by the yard it's Formal Wear it's Formal Wear Conor dog VA we make suits we should operate a food truck for 3 months straight that sounds awesome traveling around America so hot we should do a subathon so hot you worked one for Jason didn't I did work one with Jason yeah it was hard I worked Mike's we should do a subathon where we sleep in the same room and we are live the entire time and we're virtually road tripping from California to Florida virtually yeah that wouldn't take that long even this is like desert bus for hope you guys know what that is Desert bus was a a side game there was a there was a game that came out I think for the Sega S Thompson H what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you talking about always do this it was the Sega Saturn had this like pen and Teller game like with like eight games in it and they were like anti-g games they were supposed to be not fun and stupid one of them is called desert bus where you literally drive from I think it's LA to uh like Phoenix Arizona in real time on a bus that only goes 45 miles hour and it's like can you look at u a desert bus and the bus it kind of like you have to steer it because it like it veers so you have to like pay attention and I think it's the mega 64 Four Guys basically they play the game for a whole long stretch and they raise money for a for a cause I think it's like Children's Cancer so this is this is a tried and true um hey it's us what do you call it uh you're showing us a picture of us I don't know if you know that okay there it is feel there got to be speeduns of this this look awesome yeah and it's it's it's real time like you're really it's the exact or the it's the approximate distance of going from LA to Phoenix or whatever do you have the sof for gas uh I think so I can't remember cuz he's on E right now I'm seeing that damn you have to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fight this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a lot yeah it veers so you you really have to pay attention you can also crash the bus Which resets the odometer this is this is like they they have a a Mario Kart custom track that is just this like single Lane hour 2our long stretch and some people will like psychotically speedrun it but because of but because of the the wheeling in the game you have to wheelie and then it runs out after a few seconds and then you have to rewh and like time it right so people speed run it so it means holding a and spamming the wheelie button for like 90 minutes and then if your RNG is good maybe you beat the record like if the gaps between your wheelie inputs are enough that's gross yeah so and and the map is like not it's not even textured it's just a white like empty landscape and you just have to sit there well and watch Funky Kong and listen to Funky Kong scream as it is for sometimes like I love speedr running but I think sometimes maybe it's just bad yeah dude it's like Yu-Gi-Oh game I think about this a lot yeah wow I think about it in from the standpoint of like we we love it we love watching it but for the person they're dumping all of this time into a thing and they get nothing back on yeah and there and and it's beautiful for that reason cuz it means that you really want it and love it for for wanting it and nothing else what do you think but then after you're left with nothing no life skills really no like transferable career I think you have some life skills in the like the the grinding to get good like that's a that's a transferable life skill that's like a focus thing but but yeah I mean certainly like you know 5,000 hours of Mario does not net you much no outside of you know you're in like a prison like there was a there's this video of this guy beating the tetris like final grandm challenge where all the blocks go invisible and yeah yeah and he's just like crying at the end and because it's this amazing accomplishment that he's like grinded for his whole whole life basically and he's and he's he's just his friends in the room and he's like crying in his friend's arms he's like I'm free I'm finally free we're becoming Sky News pilled what does that mean the lady from Sky News after blue scooty got the tetris record and we're like we're like what's the point maybe go outside yeah outside right now it's more of we we love like we're Gamers right we understand it and we we think it's hype but there is truly this it's like when prog Gamers stop being programers right what are they supposed to do the only thing that been doing up to that point that is valuable as being watched right unless they have an engineering degree like SVG I think you can you can kind of say this about anything though right it depends if anything yields some sort of retirement plan I think if you if you let's say You Go Pro in the NFL and then you retire ignoring how much money you have you could become a Caster you could be you have so many career paths people give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about you in the public eye you can use that to your advantage for the rest of your life a a speedrunner doesn't have but that also makes it way cooler does the statistical I'm saying yeah I agree with that does the chance of that reality like influence your take on it at all also also I think a more apt comparison might be something is like some people get really into like drawing or painting or reading and like you could dump so many hours into those activities but you're very unlikely to be criticized for it yeah I think that's true I chess I think people should be more criticized for reading I I'm not trying to discourage read it I think those things are less commonly compared to speed running operating like obsessive hours of your life like speedrunners will play for 14 hours a day and then go to bed wake up and do it again I feel like an artist some artists are but a lot of artti artists are like hobbyists who like maybe they're really obsessed with something and they're doing it but it's not I don't think it's the same thing like usually you also have a job I think drawing is also a skill that you're improving that it's like like cool it's like a fun hobby it's like a good release I think all these things are cool what I'm saying yeah I see what you're saying with reading I'm I'm with you on reading there's two there's two things that work here one one is a cultural context of what are we willing to accept as something that's worth pursuing a lot of times drawing and painting it's like that thing is just like classically have been a part of human society right that's why I think chess is a good example cuz functionally now right I think chess is the best example I can think of because it's literally a video game now it didn't used to be a video game and now this thing that has like High craze and and is a very uh like laed activity historically to be like good at and to pursue has been like gamified in the same way a video game is now not only is it gamified it's also like solved you know what I mean so it's like we're just playing a worse version of Chess yeah we're we're we're trying to approach to uh what robots can do but you would be unlikely to be criticized for like dumping the same amount of hours into chess as Tony Hawk Pro SK yeah there is an Elegance ascribed to chess that we have accepted in the past like and I think that that that that lens like set by like Society or the culture like is kind of applied to everything it is the rare game that there is a even remote chance of you turning it into some like profitable Endeavor the difference is that so when compared to speedrunning which like Mario 64 speedrunning is is beautiful and hype right but at the end of the day what's interesting about speedr running is it is a game you kind of made up in your head yeah in the in the closet uh when you were you know locked in there from when your parents locked you in there and you were trying to make up cool games to right you know what I'm talking your mom logs you in the closet cuz you've been bad you stuck in there for while and you're stucking there for like 4 hours 5 hours the cat food there good for you ate all of it so you don't have anything else to do no more cat food it's lonely in there think about but basically yeah we're taking a system that already existed which is a game and then we're just applying these arbitrary rules of time to beat it the fastest and the arbit like the layers of arbitrariness that go through make it more and more cringe to a normal person like yeah I can speedrun Commander Keen yeah in 30 minutes and it's like do you think speed running do you think speedrunning is more cringe than competing in a video game then like in a traditional like I don't I don't think either are necessarily cringe but if we're talking about the context of like what a normie thinks I think yeah they'd think speedrunning is more I I think it's easier to say yo this guy's the the best you know Street Fighter player I think there's an element missing here between In the comparison to chess of like the average person who's like obsessed with chess is just like has a dopamine addiction and it's like it's just queuing a game that's easy to queue over and over again they like winning when they win it feels good and they lose it feels bad but they're not there's no there's no like end goal of what are you doing oh sh bro I like how it looked oh okay right just Greening out um uh but there's no end go of like attention like there is with streaming or like getting a world record or like any of that where like whereas if you're a chess Pro maybe you could say there is like you want to become the best in the world you want like you either want the the achievement or the recognition or whatever with a streamer I feel like it's a little bit I still think it's cool but it's more sad that it's like even at the end even if you get all the attention it you get nothing are you quitting speedr running to streaming like you're saying they're kind of one and the same because presumably you're streaming because I think streamer the the appeal of a variety streamer has a higher ceiling generally for more people like I think it's actually a viable career path for most people fail and most people won't get there but like when you if you do get there I there's not many speedrunners I would say that exist in the world that aren't actually just variety streamers who are speedr running for fun right now that are like making a lifelong career out of it no I think there's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] well it's it's different it's just speedrunners become variety creators so many people start Speed I start I'm talking about speedr running in a vacuum but you're you're so but it's never in a vacuum they like even really really phenomenal speedrunners like Bor usually switch a variety at some point or like Liam are there are there like are there like more than like 15 people who have done this is there like a a big quantity of people who have like gone from being just hardcore speed Runners to like def people with lifelong careers there's a lot of scale people who like developed their Niche Community stream streaming like some game and a lot to start there like you know technically I started just speed anything that was the only thing I did for probably you famously said that's the category that you can be found rather than like I did uh but I think your Val what you're you're trying to say is like in this example you you're measuring the the the viability of all these things based on what you do what you are able to do after spending so much time doing the one thing what makes me not I used to like look at streaming a lot more negatively I think what makes me look at it is a really cool thing it's like a way for us to protect those people and like hey I can't spend my life doing this but I think it's really I I wish someone would cuz I want to watch them do it and streaming is a way to give that person like just enough just enough to be able to make it worth it for them and it like protects something we care about which which is what I think is cool about it I just think it's sad that most of those people like they face almost no reward at the end most of the time it's an Allin it's an Allin on something with time which is so hard to see when you're in your like 20s or your teens or whatever I think the question I'm getting cuz I I agree with you is something I've been thinking about a lot lately is like what my what my time is spent on and like what what that means to me and whether it's good or bad and something I was thinking about a lot is like last year uh I was playing a lot of valerant and I'm I'm actually happy that I spent that time and I was thinking about something it was like I'm playing basketball a good amount right now and like mentally uh basketball has like replaced the part in my brain right now that like valer was fulfilling it was like this is the same like mental stimulation that I that I want and I'm putting time into playing basketball and that will ultimately be like pretty fruitless there is the added like benefit of like I'm doing something physical and there's exercise and that will benefit me in some way but there's no like there's nothing actually beyond that which is like this externality that I I don't really factor in that's better about spending my time on basketball uh is and trying to trying to get better at basketball AR the social element is a big plus I think uh it's just so many I think for the average person like anything you devote time to uh outside of anything you devote time to is sort of you can view in the same sort of like nihilistic way yeah yeah the underlying question is if we if we are spending our time on something let's say we speedrun for 10 years of our life and then we're done and it's like okay what if you could retire anyway cuz you have $6,000 million yeah you could just speedrun still like it we're kind of dancing on the idea like you said of like nihilism and spending our time just because it doesn't result in being rich later because you didn't build the skill it's like well you're supposed to enjoy the ride and Part of Me Part of Me looks at these things and when somebody decides to stream or not stream speedrun a really Niche game I feel that part of me rise up that is like critical of like wow what a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] waste of time and I thought about like well I'm trying to learn piano right now and it's but I think though like you're like you're working a full day you're going to get lunch you're playing basketball uh you you play a video game and then you play piano for like an hour and a half yeah a speedrunner is playing it all that time is one thing is that a lot of the time yeah most speedr Runners are people with regular jobs who do it as a hobby no of course they you have to have a job you have to be alive but I'm saying I'm saying all the rest of the time if you want to be good with that thing is spent on that thing for sure I I think a good chunk but I think it's it's it's it's too blank if you were if you were if you were like not working and like not doing all this stuff and just playing basketball all day I view it like very similarly yeah yeah okay that makes sense you're not so I think it's very different oh so this this feeling goes away if this person has like a like a hold on like their their life like uh like if they you can do whatever you want with your free time and it doesn't matter if my view here on speedrunning is that it requires so much of you to be significant in it unless you choose cheese like game runs or I think I I disagree on the the philosophy of that cuz I think there's something romantic in the self-destruction it's like this is this person has decided to just run down their life say [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it it's 14 hours a day playing like one of those TLC shows but instead of like my sister and me 600 lb it's you speed running like NBA Jam to be clear I also think it's awesome but I think the amount of games you have to go all in that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy is actually pretty small well it's the biggest one this leads this leads this is a thought a question I had do you think it's lame because I think there there are so many games that have existed right and the reality is most of these most games do not have like this big competitive speedrunning get so what people will do is they'll find Niche games for the sake of having a world record in something no it's not lame our good friend Mike buns has I believe third in whiz and Liz I will have no no no slander it is no longer lame if it's funny yes I agree I agree but but like I think I think it's fine if you just like a niche game and then you want to run that nich I think that's that that's fine I think intentionally seeking out a niche game that you have no connection to through the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] categories to unless it's like well I did this with uh fall guys I scrolled through the fallu speedrun page and I found out that nobody has the five wins record no one has submitted on speed.com but there's a category wow so I was like I will go live and I will get this record I didn't win one game over the course of four hours so it didn't pan out I this is how I felt you know when you read Guinness World Book of World Records as a kid and it's just some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] convoluted record that takes up half a page it's like most dicks beat off with Mickey Mouse gloves and it's like oh W and the record's like 12 cuz like nobody's actually beating dicks off with Mickey Mouse gloves this was a Paramore music video ain't it fun oh and they just set a bunch of set a bunch of arbitrary World Records uh which was funny well that's also [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rig to be fair the whole Guinness yeah but um what were you what were you saying earlier about uh jerking our friend miles our good friend of the show is what is a Jackie Chan yeah he's he's world record and Jackie Chan Stunt Master and it was just him and another guy from Brazil world record holder in Mario Party you were what your category like what is the record two story all Min games I will no no that one from I'm talking about the new one the new [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] got the record for that one too and then when he talks about gaming being a god gamer in his videos he always talks about having a world record iord but I think about uh miles cuz miles like he was in Australia and he just speedrunning jackiechan and it's like that's crazy and it's it's not like he was trying to farm a record he just found something that like you were saying occupy the space in his mind Co time's different too dude I got all my Mario Party records removed cuz they were emulator no way it goes that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that was sad I mean dud I remember I remember what it took I cuz I never thought uh about the validity of the Guinness Book of World Records I'm like yes that's the world records are kept and and I got got my gamer Edition 2008 or 2009 mik and they put a Mario it's like a Mario Kart Speed Run oh Mario Kart Mario Kart yeah oh Mario Ghost Valley 2 and Mario Kart Wii and the time that they have for the world record I'm like dude my times better than that time and then my like view of this institution just like crumbled I was like that means they could all be fake Mario Mario Party 4 is mini game Mario medley has a speedrun world record and uh for Guinness I think no no it's a no yeah it's Guinness uh and me and L have like beaten that time every time we played the game it's like seeing your dad cry you're like something's wrong here everything's broken down man what do you he likes it look I got him a gift he likes so score 1. for Gryffindor I guess I guess All Is Forgiven you know what I'm saying yeah actually I got love bombs boom [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] go don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with the Mickey hand is so good next I don't like it I found a new Speed Run game that's it's more popular than Mario Kart it's this Russian game called school boy runaway oh yeah this is such a dark game this game is fire it's crazy most dude it's crazy the most popular game in Russia Ukraine Bulgaria I think Serbia there's more Russians playing this than Counterstrike uh well it's mobile oh yeah okay that checks out I think there's 10 million plus download that checks out oh my God it's a huge game it's massive it's like uh what's the plot dude it's the plot is you are a Russian school boy and your parents want you to study and you study by standing on your bed and if you're not on your bed uh but you sorry you really want to go hang out with your friend outside and so you to get outside you have to basically uh collect some items to like either build a ladder uh to get on the roof to jump over your fence or get the code for the gate to open it but if your parents catch you outside of your room they slap you and then bring you back and then make you do a punishment like squats and if they catch you three times they beat you with a belt dude oh my god oh yeah didn't you tell us that you you found a convoluted way to jump out from the roof and then you got beat with a belt I well yeah I built a ladder up to my roof and then used used that and then I jumped over but as I jumped my mom grabbed me pulled me back slapped me and then my dad beat me with the belt so oh it's tough It's a tough game look man I played 12 hours in a row of Jack Jack Adventure on that plane I I know how it be I know how it would be this is like Nick's uh what's the Willam defo game was it 12 wasn't it oh uh 12 minutes 12 minutes oh and I'm watching and like just repeatedly get murdered the reason was dumb is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that we didn't beat it I was so mad it was like the way it was ported to switch there was like a part of the game where I don't want to spoil it but there's like like a thing you need to see that was cut off on the bottom of the screen and so I just never saw it and the only way I got through the game was we got to a point where we were so desperate we were just clicking around randomly and we happened to click it off screen that's stupid it was very stupid he was playing with Eman yeah his little brother he's a gamer we couldn't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I was like okay we can't do it together it's a hard [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] his birthday today it's his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] birthday D yeah that little piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 21 he's 21 I thought 21st was last time oh think your is crazy bro H born in 03 yeah that's crazy he doesn't remember 911 he's a posty posty 911 I could roundhouse his head right off his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] shoulders yes sir you could we all could taller now so probably I don't think your leg can get up that high he's got P something but I'd hit him in the head I I would kick him in the damn skull yeah yeah he just got back he was he's in Vietnam right now what what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's still going on anoi a dude [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up what's he doing he's been texting me fighting the good fight what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Brave sold he's just with his friend it's like his first big trip with a friend he's in Vietnam with like a friend from college and he went to the north is he like you uh in terms of traveling y I don't know come on man you know what I mean Yu does he need to seek other parts of the world to feel whole no I don't think so does he shrivel and die inside if he doesn't leave the state line no do he use a big bowl for all his meals does he learn Swedish even though they speak English there fluently no is he hard of hearing nay uh no he's like what' you say his penis look like an earthworm that's eaten too much uh haven't seen it in a while uncut though a while weird they haven't seen in a while are any of them cut are did they did they decide to switch it up on any brothers no we're all on Cut would be so funny the last brother like this one they're like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it we may as well try yeah it's it's like AB testing the thumbnail fine I'll speedrun a game you spe R game yeah what should I play Mario 64 dead psut oh dude there you go one of the most mad I've ever been was I got really into the psychonaut speedrun for a while uh this is back in Pomona and uh there there's this trick there's a speedrun trick in that game where you like take one you have to like you bounce on it Y and you go and you like fly really far um and I was trying it for hours I couldn't do it I'm like damn it's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hard speedrun turns out I'm playing on Console C to 30 FPS the trick is pretty impossible yo 30 FPS you have to play on Steam I wasted I wasted so much time he's getting owned by console ports of games yeah bro Halo on console on console's terrible I didn't realize it was like that dude it's like 15 FPS yeah that's crazy it's awful and that's how it's always been I guess yeah you didn't know no better that's what I'm realizing but then when you go over to Modern Warfare 2 you're like this feels awesome does it like compared to Halo oh yeah it feels buttery Smo fast you sprint it's like 60 FPS wow yeah it feels awesome I'm a Halo 3 I think why dude cuz everyone's like it's the best Halo but I actually think they're just old what do you think is the best Halo then reach I don't think you're telling the truth to me now right now I think that yeah I think reach is just Halo 3 but they add his Sprint I wonder if you'd like reach on Console oh I don't know yeah maybe on console's worse I thought I thought it was two you're just getting that's what Boomer say Boomers will tell you two or three I'll tell you it's Halo Reach and I like it and I won't and I won't mince my words bro Halo one was so funny cuz it was you the you spawn in with the machine gun and then the pistol and the pistol was so good and it was just this desert eagle [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with a zoom so every you just switch to your pistol right away just and that was the game it was very fun I played I played Halo 1 multiplayer on like dude my dad had this ancient laptop that could B it was like it was like 10 FPS I'd fire up blood G and I'm be like I'm gaming dude on a touchpad I didn't care oh how does that how does that how do you how do you play on a computer if it's a console game it wasn't oh it was on PC I had it I had I only had it on PC because my older brother but I had it too it it reminds I think back at those times when like cuz I gaming is so accessible and easy now but I thinking back when I was like 14 dude I would do anything just to get a whiff of some gaming bro you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] even if it I am ancient but like I think about that right like we I I just wanted to play a game so bad I would play 10 FPS blood golde I think it that that era where like PC like everything was developing so fast so so like the average computer at home that your parents had just was not built to run like any video game so you just had to tough it out cuz I that's what I did I played Lego Racers 2 on like 10 FPS yeah cuz it was just the that's all you have I play Warcraft 3 DOTA and the computer couldn't load the map very fast so it take like 4 minutes to load the game for everyone most people would leave so every time I just be like everyone would stay so I could play a full game my friends [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hated me because I had to boot up I had like an outdated old MacBook that I would uh boot camp windows on to run League of Legends because League wasn't on Mac yet that's why I never played league is cuz I had a Mac and and I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tried and I would play with them but the loading screen would take so long and it was it was so obviously because of me and uh and we're five stack every time like damn who is this I'm in I'm SP see that and leag League had this thing where it would take so long that it would just eventually would boot everybody else into the game and then you would be like 30 seconds behind everybody oh my God yeah it was it it's I I mean it's like another old man yelling at Cloud I'm not yelling at Cloud though cuz I'm like happy that all the kids have games but man not only do they have games they the greatest games of all time the greatest all time ride at their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fingertips and most of them are free to play yeah and all of them are on mobile too now run it we were uh I've told this before but it's kind of connected to a different thing but me and Aaron um used to when we were in high school we used to go to GameStop and go to the $2 bin in any game that said multiplayer we'd buy it and take it home and play and we did that with sha White snowboarding and that's we figured out we could St loock people in lobbies and they couldn't leave if you hit him with snowballs over and over again and uh so we did that for hours um and there's only one lobby in that game so you can't go anywhere we know you spawn so every time you come back you're locked um but we've been doing PSL and Aaron finally came to one he logged back into like his original Xbox account and we were in the same we're in the same Clan back in the day so we have the same gamertag and we're like playing modare 2 we're like wearing the clan like name and everything and I was like I'm it's full circle like I'm back where I was and how how should I feel about that at a moment where I was like should I feel like I haven't moved or should I feel like this is a beautiful is it an celebration or an homage to you're just a man who's who's who's attached emotionally to the context you're raised in you'll never Escape it it's good though good for feels good to drop 50 you just have to bring the good parts you have to bring the good parts and you leave you have to leave the demons behind the demons cuz once you step into one of those old games you feel the demons rise up I feel so powerful because I'll like get into a weird spot in monare 2 that no one's seen and like we were playing headquarters last night I'm like oh the I forgot I know the spot no one knows the spot cool I just crawl into it and everyone's like why isn't it capping dude all this value this happens with like also like Legacy series like uh for instance Tekken I I never played a Tekken game besides like casually right but like you go back to like Tekken 4 and the characters are doing the same [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah so you could be a guy who like casually played Tekken for the past 20 years boot up Tekken 8 hit a couple inputs you're like ah still does the same [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and you're kind of like you still get a taste of the Old Country uh I think really good when you like I think that's part of why I don't know like I like when games don't change too much over time cuz you can just like pick up a game way later and it feels like whoa it's like I still have all this yeah it still applies I didn't lose all that time that's probably the worst part about league right now is every game I'm booting into there's like two or three guys that I've never seen in my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] life I don't know their name and then they all have skins that make them look totally different so even game to game if somebody's playing the same guy I don't know it you're like that guy's wearing a beach outfit and I think he's the same as last time but I'm not sure there so many skins I have every single one cuz I got like this Riot account no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] way you have the riot Deep Web account yeah they you have that have all the juicer skins no I don't have it for Val I for League yeah I have all the juicer packs Twisted Fate I have everything bro you would you wouldn't be able to do this but if if you could sell it what do you think it would sell for I believe the price of all the league skins is I want to say like 20,00 ,000 well you can't just buy all them can you no so there's value to some that value the collecting the collecting of all of it's probably worth like a premium of 100% or something maybe so like maybe 40K wow it just can't a base model Rav 4 for dude when you stop streaming cash that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't think you could sell it why you you could sell anything you want because this is give user password turn service yeah but you're out I'd be breaking it though I have an account that has all the the crazy skins you can't buy like the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] King Ramis and black Alistar like these skins that existed by like when you if you bought the physical beta of the game in 2009 you got this skin I don't know how this account got them but I bought this account for 500 bucks whoa you bought a collector's account so I don't have as many he has like every skin in the game including all the ones you can buy but I have all the secret ones that you can't buy and that was 500 bucks did you seek it out yeah cuz it was something that I always wanted to do when I was a kid it was kind of like indulging in the Cs skin stuff for a bit Yeah you like skins we know that you like digital digital C digital and I'm I'm I'm Nomad big crypto guy you're a digital Nomad you go to burning man we're we're we're we're cash is gonna be dead soon oh my God I got into a car wreck today what what what when Cy like on the way here uh no I I was taking an Uber to get my truck because I left it at Jason's place so that's why I picked him up so I was late today and then I'm in the Uber and I'm dropped off on a size Stree that didn't I didn't recognize he's like is this it I was like I think so and he's like yeah it's the number I'm like okay yeah and then I open the door and then a car drives by and I open the door and I hit the mirror of the car that drives by and I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I open it it goes I'm like oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dude they're trying to get you and wait what how are you opening the door into a into traffic where you parked he's double parked on a street you get out to the left side of the car ding ding I'm getting out the left cuz I saw behind the driver and and I and I and I open it hits it I'm like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and then he checks out the door the door looks fine he walks over I close the door I realize it is flared out I'm like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so I start pushing it in while he's talking to the driver it pushes it nice it pushes it nice it pushes it nice I mean you got to push it then and so then I go I go I go walk over he's talking lady's really cool about it she's like yeah I'm just going to go with this fix right now I'll just charge you whatever the people charge me at the place that I get a fix we all go through Insurance he's like he's like dope swag and then he goes over to the car he pushes he's like yeah it looks good actually I'm like yeah true but her mirror shattered yeah from just the force of it dude you were this is all to get your truck right yeah dude I broke my tail light trying to move my cared to get his to jump his truck there literally tail light pieces in the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] parking lot right now and I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I gave the dude 400 cash that's what I had on me cash is King I was like cash is King never forget that and I took 100 back cuz I like that's for the lesson yeah that's for the lesson yeah uh but yeah and then but you know what made it feel better is when I drove the truck here you know those cool dudes who aren't too far away [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cool dudes they onair they're in the chair they saw a truck they're like nice that's huge they cheesed big time I was like I was like yeah yes sir [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] go dude did you steal Papa tax from Phantom tax yeah yeah I didn't know that really yeah until I found out about Phantom oh yeah no that's yeah very very blatantly stole I thought you I thought you were we really just stand on the shoulders of giants amen well that's a rude thing to call them what you're calling Phantom a Giant's rude is he I don't know what he look like that big is he is he short he is never I don't want to get into it right now L Get Right iso hold that ISO hold that ISO Mickey RZ what's he hiding under them damn shorts dude geog agresser World Cup was fire I watched the finals it was so good watch the final sick how does it how this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] work the geoguesser world cup or the hands the the two in the middle the geog guesser World Cup Michael Jackson uh the geoguesser World Cup what's up brother but it's Mickey uh the geoguesser World Cup is it's like a best of five and it's moving not moving moving not moving no moving panning or zooming whoa which is like you just look at a still image and then you just guess where it is on the map and if you're closer you get points like you damage the opponent you know yeah first one of zero points loses who's to this world who is rainbolt is he kind of like a levy like he wouldn't be in the finals but he knows a lot he's like the most famous geoguesser player and honestly he could be the best I think in the world or like very close to because there's been times where he's guessed commentating and the players haven't known but uh he also just doesn't have as many reps in geog guesser and the Reps he does do is like half a second upside down black and white yeah which is not relevant to to competitive yes Mickey Mouse category uh it is a bit mickee Mickey Mouse is where the money is but but but he could do the main category he just it's just you to grind it and the reward for that is not as big as the Mickey Mouse though I'm sure blur could be the main category for slav fire but instead he does like you know but blur it's not like he gets viewers in his G we're get proven wrong on this so fast it's going to happen instantly don't say we cuz I said I was there Nick is me today I'm board become each other become each other blur my blur my tip my hat but anyway it was fire everyone was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sponsored to watch it I was jealous you weren't no why you got connections I but I think one time I said this is the worst game of all time I want to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kill myself in a reply change a Al if ever watching this cuz this game so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bad okay and I think they didn't like that one I think I broke the partnership I
